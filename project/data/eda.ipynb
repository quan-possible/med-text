      "Index: 1303 entries, \" Reactive \" or activated stroma characterizes many malignancies including breast cancers . Recently , we isolated a reactive mouse mammary gland stromal cell line called BJ3Z . These cells express alpha-smooth muscle actin and stromal cell-derived factor 1 ( SDF-1 ) and are tumorigenic when injected into mice . Here we show that , in vivo , BJ3Z cells influence the angiogenesis and proliferation of xenografted estrogen receptor ( ER)-positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cell-derived solid tumors . The growth-promoting effects of BJ3Z cells are equivalent to those of estradiol ( E(2) ) . BJ3Z cells also increase the proliferation of normal mouse mammary luminal cells adjacent to tumors . In vitro , BJ3Z cells reorganize and increase the proliferation of cocultured malignant MCF-7 and normal human breast MCF10A cells grown as organoids in three-dimensional culture . The effects of BJ3Z cells on MCF-7 cells are equivalent to those of E(2) . In contrast , BJ3Z cells do not alter the growth of highly aggressive ER-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells . We show that BJ3Z cells secrete vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . The growth of MCF-7 organoids induced by BJ3Z can be inhibited by antagonists of VEGF and SDF-1 . Conversely , recombinant VEGF stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 , but not MDA-MB-231 , organoids . We conclude that , in addition to angiogenesis , VEGF released by activated stroma increases the growth of ER-positive malignant epithelial cells and of adjacent normal epithelium . Because activated stroma can substitute for E(2) and fosters hormone-independent growth of ER-positive tumors , we suggest that breast cancers exhibiting intrinsic hormone resistance may respond to antiangiogenic therapies . to p53 plays an important role in regulating a wide variety of cellular processes , such as cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis . Dysfunction of p53 is frequently associated with several pathologies , such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases . In recent years substantial progress has been made in developing novel p53-activating molecules . Importantly , modulation of p53 interaction with its main inhibitor , Mdm2 , has been highlighted as a promising therapy target . In this regard , bimolecular fluorescence complementation ( BiFC ) analysis , by providing direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells , offers a straightforward method to identify potential modulators of protein interactions . In this study , we developed a simple and robust Venus-based BiFC system to screen for modulators of p53-p53 and p53-Mdm2 interactions in live mammalian cells . We used nutlin-3 , a well-known disruptor of p53-Mdm2 interaction , to validate the specificity of the assay . The reduction of BiFC signal mediated by nutlin-3 was correlated with an increase in Puma transactivation , PARP cleavage , and cell death . Finally , this novel BiFC approach was exploited to identify potential modulators of p53-Mdm2 complex formation among a commercially available chemical library of 33 protein phosphatase inhibitors . Our results constitute \" proof-of-concept \" that this model has strong potential as an alternative to traditional target-based drug discovery strategies . Identification of new modulators of p53-p53 and p53-Mdm2 interactions will be useful to achieve synergistic drug efficacy with currently used anti-tumor therapies .\n",
