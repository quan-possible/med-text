In human fibroblasts , the expression of SV40 large T antigen is known to cause a variety of chromosomal aberrations and especially dicentric chromosomes . In some cases , the later aberrations have been reported to be reversible telomeric associations . We report here aberration and chromosome number studies of twenty-nine T antigen positive lineages , studied from their initiation by transfection of T antigen sequences into human diploid fibroblasts , until crisis or immortalization occurred or , in some cases until the lines became tumorigenic in nude mice . The data show that T antigen consistently produced chromosomal instability of both number and structure by an active process that began before transformation indicators were positive and continued throughout neoplastic progression . The most frequently observed aberrations were dicentric chromosomes , which were shown to be true dicentrics by examination by in situ hybridization with telomeric sequences . These data are consistent with the hypothesis that T antigen causes human fibroblasts to become neoplastically transformed by successive rounds of chromosomal mutation and lineage evolution .
BACKGROUND Although chemotherapy offers promise of increased survival for children with medulloblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme , drug resistance occurs frequently , resulting in tumor progression and death . Resistance to nitrosoureas and methylating agents , which damage DNA , can be mediated by a DNA repair protein , O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase ( AGAT ) . Depletion of this protein with alkylguanines or methylating agents , however , restores tumor cell sensitivity to the cytotoxicity of chloroethylnitrosoureas ( e.g. , carmustine [ BCNU] ) . PURPOSE This study was designed to determine whether resistance to the activity of nitrosourea ( the drug BCNU ) in BCNU-resistant human medulloblastoma ( D341 Med ) and human glioblastoma multiforme ( D-456 MG ) can be reversed by the methylating agent streptozocin and the O6-substituted guanines O6-methylguanine and O6-benzylguanine . METHODS Xenografts were grown subcutaneously in athymic BALB/c mice . BCNU was administered as a single intraperitoneal injection at doses of 100 mg/m2 , 75 mg/m2 , or 38 mg/m2--i.e. , 1.0 , 0.75 , or 0.38 , respectively , of the dose lethal to 10% of treated animals ( LD10 ) . Mice were treated intraperitoneally with a single dose of O6-benzylguanine or O6-methylguanine ( 240 mg/m2 ) or with streptozocin ( 600 mg/m2 ) daily for 4 days . Response was assessed by tumor growth delay and tumor regression . AGAT activity in the xenografts was measured at 1 and 6 hours after pretreatment , at the time tumors were excised . RESULTS Pretreatment with O6-benzylguanine , O6-methylguanine , or streptozocin reduced AGAT activity to 4% , 25% , and 95% of control values , respectively , in D341 Med and 0% , 0% , and 25% of control values , respectively , in D-456 MG 1 hour after injection . After 6 hours , levels changed to 7% , 61% , and 116% of control values in D341 Med and 0% , 79% , and 21% of control values in D-456 MG , respectively . Both D341 Med and D-456 MG xenografts were completely resistant to BCNU at its LD10 . Pretreatment with O6-benzylguanine increased BCNU sensitivity in both types of xenograft . In contrast , treatment with BCNU plus O6-methylguanine or streptozocin did not produce growth delays substantially different from those produced by BCNU alone , reflecting the more efficient depletion of AGAT by O6-benzylguanine . Following therapy with BCNU plus O6-benzylguanine at 0.38 LD10 , tumor regressions were seen in eight of 10 D341 Med and in all 10 D-456 MG xenografts . CONCLUSION We recommend comprehensive clinical toxicologic evaluation of combination therapy with O6-benzylguanine plus BCNU , which would allow subsequent design of phase I clinical trials .
Among salivary gland neoplasms are a group of rare tumors that are histologically identical to benign mixed tumors that inexplicably metastasize ; they have been called metastasizing mixed tumor ( MZMT ) of salivary glands . We report the clinicopathologic features and flow cytometric findings for 11 cases of MZMT . At the time of discovery of metastatic disease , the patients , six women and five men , ranged in age from 20 to 83 years . Primary sites of involvement included the parotid gland ( eight cases ) , submandibular gland ( two cases ) , and the nasal septum ( one case ) . With one exception , all the patients had at least a single recurrences of their primary mixed tumor , but two or more recurrences were the norm before development of metastatic foci . The metastases were discovered from six to 52 years following the occurrence of the primary tumor . Metastatic deposits were identified in bone , lung , regional lymph nodes , skin , kidney , retroperitoneum , oral cavity , pharynx , calvarium , and central nervous system . The metastases either occurred simultaneously with an episode of recurrent mixed tumor ( n = 5 ) or from 5 to 29 years after a recurrence ( n = 6 ) . The treatment of the primary , recurrent , and metastatic neoplasms was surgical excision . Follow-up , ranging from 8 months to 16 years following the diagnosis of MZMT , revealed seven patients to be alive without disease ( 64% ) and two dead of causes unrelated to metastatic disease ( 18% ) . Two patients ( 18% ) died as a direct result of metastatic tumor at 3 and 2 years after metastasis of their mixed tumors . Flow cytometric analysis revealed a diploid DNA cell population in the primary and/or metastatic tumors in nine cases . Aneuploid DNA cell content was identified in two of the cases . DNA ploidy levels and cell proliferation rates were compared with those of conventional benign mixed tumors and also with malignant mixed tumors . Retrospective analysis of histologic parameters ( mitotic rate , cellular pleomorphism , infiltrative growth , vascular or lymphatic invasion ) and flow cytometric analysis failed to identify criteria to predict the development of metastasis in these neoplasms .
The chemotherapeutic drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum ( II ) covalently binds to DNA resulting in a variety of adducts and cross-links which are thought to be responsible for the toxicity of the drug . We have used the gel mobility shift assay to detect proteins which bind to DNA treated in vitro with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum ( II ) and have identified two complexes which bind with increased affinity to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum ( II)-damaged DNA . Using monoclonal antibodies we have shown that one complex , B1 , contains human single-stranded DNA binding protein , a protein known to be involved in the in vitro repair synthesis assay of mammalian excision repair .
We have exploited properties of photosensitizers to study an aspect of the packing of chromatin in the cell nucleus . The fluorescent photosensitizers mesotetra(3-hydroxyphenyl) porphyrin and Photofrin II were both localized in the nuclear membrane and other membrane structures , but could not be found inside the nuclei . Light exposure of cells at 1 degrees C in the presence of the sensitizers induced DNA double-strand breaks . The length distributions of DNA fragments were determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis . Because DNA damage is produced mainly via singlet oxygen diffusing less than 0.1 microns from the sensitizer , DNA double-strand breaks were supposedly produced within this distance of the nuclear membrane . Consistent with this , with prolonged illumination and with increasing concentrations of sensitizer the distribution of DNA fragment lengths reached a plateau level . In contrast , with the hydrophilic , intranuclear sensitizer meso-tetra(4-sulphonatophenyl)porphyrin , no such plateau level was found . The plateau distributions of DNA fragment lengths of different cell types had the same general shape with average fragment lengths ranging from 174 to 194 kilobasepairs . Particular genes , c-myc , fos and p53 , were found on broad distributions of photocleaved fragment lengths . The results indicate that on each side of the genes the locus of the chromatin fibre situated close to the nuclear membrane , varied randomly .
Glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) class Mu activity was determined in 145 unrelated hospital patients in Berlin by measuring their conjugation activity towards the specific substrate trans-stilbene oxide ( TSO ) with two substrate concentrations ( 50 and 250 microM ) in homogenates prepared from lymphocytes . Eighty individuals ( 55.2% ) had an activity lower than 10 pmol/min/10(6) lymphocytes and were classified as GST class Mu deficient . In 142 of 145 cases , phenotype was confirmed by the results of a genotyping procedure using the polymerase chain reaction technique . Two fragments of 273 and about 650 bp including one and two introns , respectively , could always be amplified from genomic DNA in individuals with high GST class Mu activity and could not be amplified in persons with impaired glutathione-TSO conjugation activity . This indicates that persons with low activity carry a large deletion mutation within the GST class Mu gene . The enzymatically determined antimode between low and high activity determined as 10 pmol/min/1 million lymphocytes in the assay with 50 microM TSO could be clearly confirmed by genotyping .
p53 and INK4a/ARF mutations promote tumorigenesis and drug resistance , in part , by disabling apoptosis . We show that primary murine lymphomas also respond to chemotherapy by engaging a senescence program controlled by p53 and p16(INK4a) . Hence , tumors with p53 or INK4a/ARF mutations-but not those lacking ARF alone-respond poorly to cyclophosphamide therapy in vivo . Moreover , tumors harboring a Bcl2-mediated apoptotic block undergo a drug-induced cytostasis involving the accumulation of p53 , p16(INK4a) , and senescence markers , and typically acquire p53 or INK4a mutations upon progression to a terminal stage . Finally , mice bearing tumors capable of drug-induced senescence have a much better prognosis following chemotherapy than those harboring tumors with senescence defects . Therefore , cellular senescence contributes to treatment outcome in vivo .
Dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , a well-known differentiation inducer in several myeloid cells , also induces a reversible G(1) arrest in many cell lines . We recently showed that DMSO induces a G(1) phase arrest in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells , by restoring contact inhibition and preventing high density-dependent apoptosis . CHO cells are frequently used in cell biology and mutagenesis studies due to their good growth capacity and ease of manipulation but are very difficult to synchronize by serum starvation since they detach from monolayers when they reach confluence . In this study we investigated the possibility of using DMSO to reversibly synchronize CHO cells in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle and analysed whether toxic effects follow the arrest using growth curve , sister chromatid exchange and micronuclei assays . We carried out a kinetic analysis of the arrest by DMSO and re-entry into the cell cycle after drug release by cytofluorimetric analysis of DNA content and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation . We show that CHO cells are efficiently and reversibly arrested in G(1) by DMSO in concentrations ranging between 1 and 2% . In our experiments , >90% of cells grown for 96 h in presence of the drug were arrested in G(1) and synchronously re-entered S phase approximately 8-12 h after release . Furthermore , expression levels of p27 were down-regulated during G(1) progression and cyclin D3 and E expression patterns were similar to those observed after serum starvation . No detectable cytotoxicity or genetic damage were induced in G(1) released cells as revealed by the tests employed . Our results show that DMSO is a very powerful inducer of G(1) synchronization in CHO cells without detectable cytotoxic or genetic effects in cell populations released from G(1) arrest . DMSO synchronization represents a model system in which to analyse protein activities regulating G(1) progression and investigate the response of G(1) cells to mutagen treatments .
Dietary exposure to aflatoxins is one of the major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma . Individual susceptibility to aflatoxin-induced hepatocarcinogenesis may be modulated by both genetic and environmental factors affecting metabolism . A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate determinants of the formation of aflatoxin covalently bound to albumin ( AFB1-albumin adducts ) . A total of 474 subjects who were free of liver cancer and cirrhosis and were initially selected as controls for previous case-control studies of aflatoxin-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in Taiwan , were employed in this study . Aflatoxin-albumin adducts were determined by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis C virus by enzyme immunoassay , as well as genotypes of glutathione S-transferase M1-1 and T1-1 by polymerase chain reaction . The detection rate of AFB1-albumin adducts was significantly higher in males ( 42.5% ) than in females ( 21.6% ) ( multivariate-adjusted odds ratio=2.6 , 95% confidence interval=1.4-5.0 ) . The formation of detectable albumin adducts was moderately higher in hepatitis B surface antigen carriers ( 42.8% ) than in non-carriers ( 36.6% ) ( multivariate-adjusted odds ratio=1.4 , 95% confidence interval=1.0-2.1 ) . In addition , the detection rate of AFB1-albumin adducts tended to increase with the increasing number of null genotypes of glutathione S-transferase M1-1 and glutathione S-transferase T1-1 . In conclusion , this cross-sectional study has assessed the relative contributions of environmental exposure and host susceptibility factors in the formation of AFB1-albumin adducts in a well characterised Chinese adult population . This study further emphasises the necessity to reduce aflatoxin exposure in people living in an area endemic for chronic hepatitis B virus infection .
Genomic instability has long been recognized as the main feature of neoplasia and a factor modulating individual cancer susceptibility . There are attempts to find effective assays of both individual DNA repair capacity and genetic instability , and their relation to the cancer risk . Genetic predisposition plays an important role in the etiology and development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . The aim of our study was to search for a correlation between chromosomal instability and DNA repair capacity in HNSCC patients and healthy controls . The chromosomal instability was measured by the number of bleomycin ( BLM)-induced chromosomal aberrations and diepoxybutane ( DEB)-induced sister chromatid exchanges . The DNA repair capacity was assessed using the DEB-induced adaptive response ( AR ) . The HNSCC patients in our study showed a significant increase in chromosomal instability after a preterminal exposure of their lymphocytes to either BLM for the last 5 h or DEB for the last 24 h of incubation . However , the AR was higher in HNSCC patients than in the control group , suggesting an increase in the DNA repair capacity in the cancer patients as compared to the control . There is no correlation between the DNA repair capacity estimated on the basis of preterminal exposures to BLM and DEB and the DNA repair capacity estimated on the basis of the adaptive response to DEB . The preterminal exposure and the adaptive response test may activate different DNA repair mechanisms .
Comparative mutagenesis studies of N-(2'-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene ( dG-AAF ) and N-(2'-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminofluorene ( dG-AF ) adducts positioned in the Nar I restriction enzyme site were performed using Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and simian kidney ( COS-7 ) cells . Oligodeoxynucleotides ( (5)(')TCCTCG(1)G(2)CG(3)CCTCTC ) containing a recognition sequence for the Nar I restriction enzyme were modified site-specifically with dG-AAF or dG-AF . Modified and unmodified oligomers inserted into single-stranded phagemid shuttle vectors were used to transform E. coli or to transfect COS-7 cells . Following replication in host cells , progeny plasmids were recovered and analyzed for mutations . In SOS-induced E. coli , dG-AAF primarily induced one- and two-base deletions . The mutational frequency varied , depending on the position modified in the Nar I site ; 91% two-base deletions were observed at G(3) , while 8.4% and 2.8% deletions were detected at G(2) and G(1) , respectively . In contrast , dG-AF at any position in the Nar I site failed to produce deletions , generating primarily G --> T transversions ( mutational frequency , 7.6-8.4% ) . In COS-7 cells , both dG-AAF and dG-AF primarily induced G --> T transversions . Mutation frequencies for dG-AAF were 9.4-24% , the highest values being at G(1) and G(3) . Mutation frequencies for dG-AF were 9.3-21% , the higher value at G(2) . We conclude from this study that the mutation potential of dG-AAF and dG-AF depends on the structure of the adduct , the sequence context of the lesion , and the host cell used for the experiment .
Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry has been used for the detection and the structural characterization of T-rich model oligonucleotides covalently modified by estradiol-2,3-quinone . After separation by gradient elution , adducts were analyzed by negative electrospray mass spectrometry , enabling to evidence and localize the modifications in the oligonucleotide sequence . Modifications by one molecule of estrogen were evidenced on purines ( A , G ) whereas no reaction was observed on pyrimidic bases ( T ) . Isomeric adducts were differentiated using tandem mass spectrometry , and energy resolved mass spectrometry allowed to underline differences in the behavior of the adducts towards collisional excitation into an ion trap device .
The Escherichia coli AlkB protein protects against the cytotoxicity of methylating agents by repair of the DNA lesions 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine , which are generated in single-stranded stretches of DNA . AlkB is an alpha-ketoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase that oxidizes the relevant methyl groups and releases them as formaldehyde . Here , we identify two human AlkB homologs , ABH2 and ABH3 , by sequence and fold similarity , functional assays , and complementation of the E. coli alkB mutant phenotype . The levels of their mRNAs do not appear to correlate with cell proliferation but tissue distributions are different . Both enzymes remove 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine from methylated polynucleotides in an alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent reaction , and act by direct damage reversal with the regeneration of the unsubstituted bases . AlkB , ABH2 , and ABH3 can also repair 1-ethyladenine residues in DNA with the release of acetaldehyde .
Food-derived heterocyclic aromatic amines ( HCAs ) have proved to be carcinogenic in both rodents and nonhuman primates . Two different metabolic pathways are suggested for the metabolic activation of HCA . The hepatic pathway proceeds via a two-step process involving N-hydroxylation by cytochrome P4501A2 and subsequent O-acetylation by N-acetyltransferase-2 . An alternative pathway may be of particular interest in extrahepatic tissues and proceeds via one-electron oxidation catalyzed by prostaglandin H synthase ( PHS ) , rendering free-radical metabolites . In this study , we investigated the metabolic activation of two HCAs , 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline ( IQ ) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ( PhIP ) , by two different enzyme systems in vitro , generating different primary and secondary reactive metabolites . Rat liver S9 mix and PHS were used as the activating system and represent the hepatic and extrahepatic pathways , respectively . Electron-spin resonance spectroscopy showed that both IQ and PhIP exerted inhibiting effects on PHS-mediated formation of hydroxyl radicals during the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins . Evidence for the formation of HCA free radicals was presented in an indirect way by the formation of glutathione-derived thiyl radicals , with purified PHS as the activating system . Activation by S9 mix did not result in the formation of detectable radical metabolites , showing that the two metabolic routes primarily led to the formation of different metabolites . In all electron-spin resonance experiments , IQ appeared to be more effective than PhIP . In contrasts , DNA adduct analysis by means of ( 32)P-postlabeling showed similar adduct patterns for S9 and PHS in single-stranded and double-stranded salmon testes DNA after incubation with PhIP , indicating the ultimate formation of a common reactive intermediate . For IQ , activation by PHS led to an additional adduct spot that was not present after S9 activation . Furthermore , activation of IQ resulted in higher adduct levels compared with PhIP for both activation pathways . Overall , adduct levels were higher in single-stranded DNA than double-stranded DNA . Our results showed that the hepatic and extrahepatic pathways resulted in different primary metabolites , while the ultimate formation of a similar reactive intermediate for PhIP , possibly an arylnitrenium ion , suggested that both pathways could play an important role in the onset of carcinogenesis .
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Mre11p , Rad50p , and Xrs2p function as a multiprotein complex that has a central role in several DNA repair mechanisms . Though Mre11p has both single-stranded and double-stranded 3'-5 ' exonuclease activity in vitro , null mutants of MRE11 , RAD50 , and XRS2 exhibit reduced 5'-3 ' resection of HO-induced double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) in vivo . In this study , we analyzed four mre11 mutants harboring changes in the N-terminus of Mre11p where the four phosphoesterase motifs specify the in vitro nuclease activities of Mre11p and its homologues . We find that the 5'-3 ' resection defects in vivo do not correlate with several mitotic phenotypes : non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) , telomere length maintenance , and adaptation to the DNA damage-inducible G2/M checkpoint . Overexpression of the 5'-3 ' exonuclease Exo1p in a mre11Delta strain partially increased 5'-3 ' resection and partially suppressed both methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) hypersensitivity and adaptation phenotypes , but did not affect telomere length or NHEJ . Surprisingly , the co-expression of two alleles , mre11-58S and mre11-N113S , each of which confers MMS hypersensitivity and short telomeres , can fully complement the MMS sensitivity and shortened telomere length of mre11Delta cells . We propose that at least two separate activities associated with the N-terminus of Mre11p are required for its mitotic function .
We have made xeroderma pigmentosum group A gene ( XPA)-knockout mice ( XPA(-/-) mice ) . The XPA(-/-) mice had no detectable activity for nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and showed a high incidence of UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis . We have also found that cell lines derived from skin cancers in UVB-irradiated XPA(-/-) mice become tolerant to UV-irradiation and showed abnormal UV-induced cell cycle checkpoints and decreased mismatch repair ( MMR ) activity . These results suggested that the MMR-downregulation may help cells escape killing by UV-irradiation and thus MMR-deficient clones are selected for during the tumorigenic transformation of XPA(-/-) cells . In this report , we examined whether the incidence of UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis is enhanced in XPA(-/-)MSH2(-/-) , XPA(-/-) and MSH2(-/-) mice when compared with that in wild-type mice . Our results indicate that the MSH2-deficiency caused a high incidence of spontaneous and UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis and the XPA and MSH2 genes have additive roles in the UV-induced skin tumorigenesis .
BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is a leading cause of death worldwide . Frequent cytogenetic abnormalities that occur in HCC suggest that tumor-modifying genes ( oncogenes or tumor suppressors ) may be driving selection for amplification or deletion of these particular genetic regions . In many cases , however , the gene(s) that drive the selection are unknown . Although techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) have traditionally been used to identify cytogenetic aberrations , it might also be possible to identify them indirectly from gene-expression studies . A technique we have called comparative genomic microarray analysis ( CGMA ) predicts regions of cytogenetic change by searching for regional gene-expression biases . CGMA was applied to HCC gene-expression profiles to identify regions of frequent cytogenetic change and to identify genes whose expression is misregulated within these regions . RESULTS Using CGMA , 104 HCC gene-expression microarray profiles were analyzed . CGMA identified 13 regions of frequent cytogenetic change in the HCC samples . Ten of these regions have been detected in previous CGH studies ( +lq , -4q , +6p , -8p , +8q , -13q , -16q , -17p , +17q , +20q ) . CGMA identified three additional regions that have not been previously identified by CGH ( +5q , +12q , +19p ) . Genes located in regions of frequent cytogenetic change were examined for changed expression in the HCC samples . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that CGMA predictions using gene-expression microarray datasets are a practical alternative to CGH profiling . In addition , CGMA might be useful for identifying candidate genes within cytogenetically abnormal regions .
AIM To develop a simple , fast and inexpensive approach as well as an instrument for detection of gene mutation . METHODS Pyrosequencing based on bioluminometry assay was employed to detect gene mutation . Pyrosequencing is a method of sequencing by synthesis step-by-step using four enzymes , DNA-polymerase , ATP sulfurylase , luciferase and apyrase . The signal was produced by detecting pyrophosphate released during a dNTP incorporation . For mutation detection , a DNA fragment was amplified by PCR at first , followed by a single-stranded DNA preparation . In the second step , a short primer was annealed to the position just before the mutation point . Finally , specific dNTPs were added in terms of the template sequence . The mutation species can be readily determined by the sequence . RESULTS A new instrument was developed for gene mutation detection by pyrosequencing . To iteratively inject small amount of each dNTP for the sequencing reaction , capillaries were used to connect dNTP reservoirs and the reaction chamber . Each dNTP was delivered by adding a gas pressure on the top of a corresponding dNTP reservoir , by which 0.2 microL of dNTP can be exactly added each time . It was theoretically proved that undesired liquid seep through the capillary did not affect the sequencing reactions in pyrosequencing . In addition , the three possible variants ( wildtype , mutant and heterozygote ) of a mutant point Cys275Ser in P53 gene exon 8 were determined by pyrosequencing using the instrument . A simple method was also described for rapidly distinguishing the type of a variant . CONCLUSION The developed method is very simple , and the corresponding instrument is inexpensive and easy to operate , which can be used to detect many types of mutation .
We examined the influence of the level of dietary protein or vitamin E ( VE ) on oxidative damage to DNA , lipids , and protein in the liver after total body irradiation ( TBI ) with X-rays at 1 or 4 Gy . Levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine , thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances , and protein carbonyls in the liver did not differ among the groups that did not receive TBI . However , oxidative damage to lipids and protein was increased by TBI only in the 1% protein group . DNA damage , lipid peroxidation , or protein oxidation in the liver was increased by TBI in a dose-dependent manner , and the damage was consistently higher in the 1% than in the 20% protein group . In the 1% protein group , a greater decrease in relative spleen weight by TBI was also observed . Concentrations of antioxidants ( vitamins C and E and glutathione ) in the liver were lower and the concentration of nonheme iron in the liver was higher in the 1% than in the 20% protein group . Mice fed a 1% protein diet became susceptible to TBI-induced oxidative damage , and decreases in antioxidant levels and an increase in iron level were involved in the mechanism of this susceptibility . These results suggest that dietary VE and protein can prevent oxidative damage to DNA , lipid , and protein in mice subjected to TBI . Consumption of a VE-free diet significantly increased 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels in DNA from mice fed the 1% protein diet with TBI , but such changes were not detected in DNA from mice fed the 20% protein diet .
OBJECTIVE To explore the adduct characteristics of styrene and DNA . METHODS The adduct reactions between styrene , urinary mandalic acid(MA) , phenylglyoxalic acid(PGA) , mercapturic acid of styrene ( UMA ) and DNA were studied by ultraviolet spectral analysis . The SO-DNA adducts by 32P-post labeled method , the chemical structures of SO-DNA adducts by GC-MS and NMR were also studied . RESULTS SO combined with DNA at O6 , N2 positions of dGMP to form six adducts , but styrene , urinary mandalic acid , phenylglyoxalic acid and mercapturic acid of styrene did not react with DNA to form adduct . CONCLUSIONS Styrene formed adduct with DNA through its active center metabolite--SO after entering the body . SO combined with DNA at O6 , N2 positions of dGMP to form adducts . If these DNA adducts are not repaired or are mis-repaired before cell duplication , the gene mutation and chemical damage would happen . No adduct reactions are seen among other metabolites of styrene .
We have developed fluorescent probes for the detection of strand scission in the excision repair of oxidatively damaged bases . They were hairpin-shaped oligonucleotides , each containing an isomer of thymine glycol or 5,6-dihydrothymine as a damaged base in the center , with a fluorophore and a quencher at the 5'- and 3'-ends , respectively . Fluorescence was detected when the phosphodiester linkage at the damage site was cleaved by the enzyme , because the short fragment bearing the fluorophore could not remain in a duplex form hybridized to the rest of the molecule at the incubation temperature . The substrate specificities of Escherichia coli endonuclease III and its human homolog , NTH1 , determined by using these probes agreed with those determined previously by gel electrophoresis using ( 32)P-labeled substrates . Kinetic parameters have also been determined by this method . Since different fluorophores were attached to the oligonucleotides containing each lesion , reactions with two types of substrates were analyzed separately in a single tube , by changing the excitation and detection wavelengths . These probes were degraded during an incubation with a cell extract . Therefore , phosphorothioate linkages were incorporated to protect the probes from nonspecific nucleases , and the base excision repair activity was successfully detected in HeLa cells .
The contribution of a type II restriction-modification system ( R-M system ) to genome integrity and cell viability was investigated . We established experimental conditions which enabled the achievement of hemimethylated and unmethylated states for the specific bases of the recognition sequences of the host's DNA . To achieve this , we constructed the MboII R-M system containing only one ( i.e . M2.MboII ) out of two functional MboII methyltransferases found in Moraxella bovis . Using the incomplete R-M system we were able to perturb the balance between methylation and restriction in an inducible manner . We demonstrate that upon the SOS-induced DNA repair in the mitomycin C treated cells , restriction significantly reduces cell viability . Similar results for the well-studied wild type EcoRI R-M system , expressed constitutively in Escherichia coli , were obtained . Our data provide further insights into the benefits and disadvantages of maintaining of a type II R-M system , highlighting its impact on host cell fitness .
BACKGROUND Lung cancer often develops in association with chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases with an influx of neutrophils . More detailed information on inflammatory pathways and the role of neutrophils herein is a prerequisite for understanding the mechanism of inflammation associated cancer . METHODS In the present study , we used microarrays in order to obtain a global view of the transcriptional responses of the lung to LPS in mice , which mimics an acute lung inflammation . To investigate the influence of neutrophils in this process , we depleted mice from circulating neutrophils by treatment with anti-PMN antibodies prior to LPS exposure . RESULTS A total of 514 genes was greater than 1.5-fold differentially expressed in the LPS induced lung inflammation model. 394 of the 514 were up regulated genes mostly involved in cell cycle and immune/inflammation related processes , such as cytokine/chemokine activity and signalling . Down regulated genes represented nonimmune processes , such as development , metabolism and transport . Notably , the number of genes and pathways that were differentially expressed , was reduced when animals were depleted from circulating neutrophils , confirming the central role of neutrophils in the inflammatory response . Furthermore , there was a significant correlation between the differentially expressed gene list and the promutagenic DNA lesion M1dG , suggesting that it is the extent of the immune response which drives genetic instability in the inflamed lung . Several genes that were specifically regulated by the presence of activated neutrophils could be identified and these were mostly involved in interferon signalling , oxidative stress response and cell cycle progression . The latter possibly refers to a higher rate of cell turnover in the inflamed lung with neutrophils , suggesting that the neutrophil influx is associated with a higher risk for the accumulation and fixation of mutations . CONCLUSION Gene expression profiling identified specific genes and pathways that are related to neutrophilic inflammation and could be associated to cancer development and indicate an active role of neutrophils in mediating the LPS induced inflammatory response in the mouse lung .
Treatment for glioblastoma multiforme includes the alkylating agent temozolomide combined with ionizing radiation . Persistent O6-guanine methylation by temozolomide in O6-methylguanine methyl transferase negative tumors causes cytotoxic lesions recognized by DNA mismatch repair , triggering apoptosis . Resistance ( intrinsic or acquired ) presents obstacles to successful temozolomide treatment , limiting drug efficacy and life expectancy . Two glioma cell lines , SNB19 and U373 , sensitive to temozolomide ( GI(50) values 36 and 68 microM , respectively ) were exposed to increasing temozolomide concentrations ( 1-100 microM ) . Variant cell lines ( SNB19VR , U373VR ) were generated that displayed acquired temozolomide resistance ( GI(50) values 280 and 289 microM , respectively ) . Cross-resistance to mitozolomide was observed in U373VR cells only . In clonogenic and MTT assays , methylguanine methyltransferase ( MGMT ) depletion using O6-benzylguanine sensitized U373VR cells to temozolomide , indicating the resistance mechanism involves MGMT re-expression . Indeed , Western blot analyses revealed MGMT protein in cell lysates . In SNB19VR cells , down-regulation of MSH6 message and protein expression may confer temozolomide tolerance . Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( a key base excision repair ( BER ) enzyme ) partially restored sensitivity , and DNA repair gene arrays demonstrated up-regulation ( >5-fold ) of BER gene NTL1 in SNB19VR cells . In conclusion , we have developed two glioma cell lines whose distinct mechanisms of acquired resistance to temozolomide , involving expression of MGMT , or inactivation of DNA mismatch repair and recruitment of BER enzymes , are consistent with clinical observations . These cell lines provide valuable models for the development of strategies to combat temozolomide resistance .
Caveolin-1 ( -/- ) null stromal cells are a novel genetic model for cancer-associated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts . Here , we used an unbiased informatics analysis of transcriptional gene profiling to show that Cav-1 ( -/- ) bone-marrow derived stromal cells bear a striking resemblance to the activated tumor stroma of human breast cancers . More specifically , the transcriptional profiles of Cav-1 ( -/- ) stromal cells were most closely related to the primary tumor stroma of breast cancer patients that had undergone lymph-node ( LN ) metastasis . This is consistent with previous morphological data demonstrating that a loss of stromal Cav-1 protein ( by immuno-histochemical staining in the fibroblast compartment ) is significantly associated with increased LN-metastasis . We also provide evidence that the tumor stroma of human breast cancers shows a transcriptional shift towards oxidative stress , DNA damage/repair , inflammation , hypoxia , and aerobic glycolysis , consistent with the " Reverse Warburg Effect " . Finally , the tumor stroma of " metastasis-prone " breast cancer patients was most closely related to the transcriptional profiles derived from the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease . This suggests that certain fundamental biological processes are common to both an activated tumor stroma and neuro-degenerative stress . These processes may include oxidative stress , NO over-production ( peroxynitrite formation ) , inflammation , hypoxia , and mitochondrial dysfunction , which are thought to occur in Alzheimer?s disease pathology . Thus , a loss of Cav-1 expression in cancer-associated myofibroblasts may be a protein biomarker for oxidative stress , aerobic glycolysis , and inflammation , driving the " Reverse Warburg Effect " in the tumor micro-environment and cancer cell metastasis .
BACKGROUND CDC4/FBXW7 , encoding a ubiquitin ligase , maps to 4q32 and has been implicated as a tumor suppressor gene and therapeutic target in many tumor types . Mutations in colonic adenomas , and the frequent losses on 4q described in gastric cancer prompt speculation about the role of CDC4/FBXW7 in gastric carcinogenesis . METHODS We assessed the role of CDC4/FBXW7 in gastric cancer , through loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification ( MLPA ) on 47 flow-sorted gastric carcinomas including early-onset gastric cancers ( EOGC ) and xenografted conventional gastric carcinomas . Ploidy analysis was carried out on 39 EOGCs and immunohistochemistry of CDC4/FBXW7 and its substrates c-myc , c-jun , Notch and cyclin E was performed on 204 gastric carcinomas using tissue microarrays ( TMAs ) . Sequence analysis of CDC4/FBXW7 was carried out on gastric carcinoma cell lines and xenografts . RESULTS Loss of heterozygosity of CDC4/FBXW7 occurred in 32% of EOGCs , and correlated with loss of expression in 26% . Loss of expression was frequent in both EOGC and conventional gastric cancers . No CDC4/FBXW7 mutations were found and loss of CDC4/FBXW7 did not correlate with ploidy status . There was a significant correlation between loss of CDC4/FBXW7 expression and upregulation of c-myc . CONCLUSION Loss of CDC4/FBXW7 appears to play a role in both EOGC and conventional gastric carcinogenesis , and c-myc overexpression is likely to be an important oncogenic consequence of CDC4/FBXW7 loss .
Chromosomal instability and the subsequent genetic mutations are considered to be critical factors in the development of the majority of solid tumors , but the mechanisms by which a stable diploid cell loses the ability to maintain genomic integrity are not well characterized . We have approached this critical issue through the use of high-throughput screens in untransformed diploid epithelial cells . In a screen of a cDNA library , we identified 13 kinases whose overexpression leads to increased ploidy . In a series of shRNA screens , we identified 16 kinases whose loss leads to increased ploidy . In both cDNA and shRNA screens , the majority of hits have not been linked previously to genomic stability . We further show that sustained loss of the shRNA screening hits leads to multipolar spindles and heterogeneous chromosome content , two characteristics of chromosomal instability . Loss of several of the kinases leads to loss of contact inhibition and to anchorage-independent growth , vital traits acquired during tumor development . We anticipate that this work will serve as a template for the comprehensive identification of pathways whose dysregulation can drive tumorigenesis through impaired karyotypic maintenance .
Current palliative chemotherapy ( CT ) regimens achieve clinical benefits in less than 50% of patients treated for metastatic gastric cancers , and long-term survivals are anecdotical . Genetic polymorphisms and differences at the level of transcription in genes involved in biological processes of drug metabolism , DNA repair and drug resistance can explain the observed individual differences in response to drugs , in survival and in different susceptibility to the toxic effects of CT . The possibility to classify patients on the basis of genetic signatures could help in choosing the CT regimen . We present herein an analysis of genetic and expression profiling of three patients affected by metastatic gastric cancer , treated with CT and alive , disease-free , at 66-82 months . Four patients with typical clinical outcome represented the control group . Expression profiling from paraffin-embedded tumor tissues was performed on an ad hoc set of genes involved in drug metabolism and resistance , DNA repair , cell cycle regulation and growth factors signalling . Genetic polymorphism analysis on DNA extracted from peripheral blood was done by pyrosequencing of genetic markers predictive of drug response . Expression analysis in long-term survivors revealed a significant upregulation of PTEN , TP63 , GADD45a and MAPK1 genes . We found also an upregulation of CYP1A1 , CYP3A4 and ERBB4 genes . EGF was found to be down-regulated in long-term survivors . ERCC1 C8092A polymorphism seems to be associated with survival in our set of patients . The present study shed light on a set of genes , which could have a predictive role in survival of patients with metastatic gastric tumors .
BACKGROUND Though an increased efficacy of carmustine and temozolomide ( TMZ ) has been demonstrated by inactivation of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) with O(6)-benzyl-guanine ( BG ) in human pancreatic tumors refractive to alkylating agents , the regulatory mechanisms have not been explored . METHODS The effects of TMZ and BG on apoptosis , cell growth , the mitotic index , cell cycle distribution , and protein expression were studied by TUNEL , cell counting , flow cytometry , and Western blot analysis , respectively . RESULTS The wt-p53 human pancreatic tumor cell line Capan-2 and p53-efficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were more responsive to treatment with TMZ + BG than mutant p53 Capan-1 and p53-null MEFs . S phase delay with a subsequent G2/M arrest was observed in Capans in response to BG + TMZ . The G1-to-S transition delay in Capan-2 was associated with p53-dependent apoptosis and was distinctly different from the presumed mismatch repair ( MMR ) killing operative during the G2/M arrest . The effect of p53 on BG + TMZ toxicity was supported by a marked change in apoptosis when p53 function was restored/inactivated . There was an early induction of MMR proteins in p53-efficient lines . CONCLUSION p53 provokes a classic proapoptotic response by delaying G1-to-S progression , but it may also facilitate cell killing by enhancing MMR-related cell cycle arrest and cell death .
Construction industry workers are exposed to many known carcinogens in their complex occupational environment . Since there are no past studies on genotoxicity among this group in the Indian subcontinent , workers engaged in different construction sites at Coimbatore , Tamil Nadu , India , were assessed here . We enrolled 96 workers and 68 control subjects with similar mean age , smoking , tobacco chewing prevalence and alcohol consumption , for analysis of DNA damage in blood leucocytes by micronucleus ( MN ) and comet assays . DNA repair inhibition was also analyzed by assessing the XPD gene . Construction workers showed a significant increase in MN and comet tail length compared to controls with adjustment for smoking habits , tobacco chewing , alcohol consumption and years of exposure ( P<0.05 ) . The results indicated that chronic occupational exposure to cement during construction work could lead to increased levels of DNA damage and repair inhibition .
p53 is a well-known transcription factor that controls cell cycle arrest and cell death in response to a wide range of stresses . Moreover , p53 regulates glucose metabolism and its mutation results in the metabolic switch to the Warburg effect found in cancer cells . Nucleotide biosynthesis is also critical for cell proliferation and the cell division cycle . Nonetheless , little is known about whether p53 regulates nucleotide biosynthesis . Here we demonstrated that p53-inducible microRNA-34a ( miR-34a ) repressed inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) , a rate-limiting enzyme of de novo GTP biosynthesis . Treatment with anti-miR-34a inhibitor relieved the expression of IMPDH upon DNA damage . Ultimately , miR-34a-mediated inhibition of IMPDH resulted in repressed activation of the GTP-dependent Ras signaling pathway . In summary , we suggest that p53 has a novel function in regulating purine biosynthesis , aided by miR-34a-dependent IMPDH repression .
BACKGROUND The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a validated therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . However , current single agent receptor targeting does not achieve a maximal therapeutic effect , and some mutations confer resistance to current available agents . In the current study we have examined , in different NSCLC cell lines , the combined effect of RNA interference targeting the EGFR mRNA , and inactivation of EGFR signaling using different receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) or a monoclonal antibody cetuximab . METHODS NSCLC cells ( cell lines HCC827 , H292 , H358 , H1650 , and H1975 ) were transfected with EGFR siRNA and/or treated with the TKIs gefitinib , erlotinib , and afatinib , and/or with the monoclonal antibody cetuximab . The reduction of EGFR mRNA expression was measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR . The down-regulation of EGFR protein expression was measured by western blot , and the proliferation , viability , caspase3/7 activity , and apoptotic morphology were monitored by spectrophotometry , fluorimetry , and fluorescence microscopy . The combined effect of EGFR siRNA and different drugs was evaluated using a combination index . RESULTS EGFR-specific siRNA strongly inhibited EGFR protein expression almost equally in all cell lines and inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis in all NSCLC cell lines studied , albeit with a different magnitude . The effects on growth obtained with siRNA was strikingly different from the effects obtained with TKIs . The effects of siRNA probably correlate with the overall oncogenic significance of the receptor , which is only partly inhibited by the TKIs . The cells which showed weak response to TKIs , such as the H1975 cell line containing the T790M resistance mutation , were found to be responsive to siRNA knockdown of EGFR , as were cell lines with downstream TKI resistance mutations . The cell line HCC827 , harboring an exon 19 deletion mutation , was more than 10-fold more sensitive to TKI proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction than any of the other cell lines . Cetuximab alone had no relevant in vitro activity at concentrations obtainable in the clinic . The addition of EGFR siRNA to either TKIs or cetuximab additively enhanced growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in all five cell lines , independent of the EGFR mutation status ( wild-type or sensitizing mutation or resistant mutation ) . The strongest biological effect was observed when afatinib was combined with an EGFR-specific siRNA . CONCLUSIONS EGFR knockdown by siRNA further decreases the cell growth of lung cancer cells that are treated with TKIs or cetuximab alone , confirming that single agent drug targeting does not achieve a maximal biological effect . The siRNA inhibits EGFR oncogenic activity that bypasses downstream " resistance " mutations such as KRAS and PTEN . The combined treatment of siRNA and EGFR inhibitory agents is additive . The combination of a potent , irreversible kinase inhibitor such as afatinib , with EGFR-specific siRNAs should be further investigated as a new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer and other EGFR dependent cancers , including those with downstream resistance mutations .
OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of CdTe QDs ( cadmium telluride quantum dots ) on oxidative stress and DNA damage of liver cells in mice . METHODS Thirty ICR male mice were randomly divided into 5 groups : one negative control ( normal saline ) group . Three CdTe QDs groups ( exposed by intravenous injection of 0.2 ml of CdTe QDs at the concentration of 3.75 , 37.5 and 375 nmol/ml respectively ) for electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) test , and another positive control group ( exposed by intravenous injection of 0.2 ml of cyclophosphamide 20 mg/ml ) for single cell gel electrophoresis ( SCGE ) test . All mice were decapitated 24h after the injection , free radicals and DNA damage of liver cells were detected by EPR and SCGE . RESULTS The levels of oxygen free radicals detected by EPR were increased with the increase of CdTe QDs . The tail length , olive tail moment , tail DNA ( % ) and the ratio of tail/head examined by SCGE were also increased with the increase of the dosage of CdTe QDs ( P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSION CdTe QDs could induce oxidative stress and DNA damage of liver cells in mice with a dose-effect relationship .
We have evaluated DNA damage ( DNA adduct formation ) after feeding benzo[a]pyrene ( BP ) to wild-type ( WT ) and cancer-susceptible Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice deficient in nucleotide excision repair and haploinsufficient for the tumor suppressor p53 . DNA damage was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry ( HPLC/ES-MS/MS ) , which measures r7,t8,t9-trihydroxy-c-10-(N ( 2)-deoxyguanosyl)-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene ( BPdG ) , and a chemiluminescence immunoassay ( CIA ) , using anti-r7,t8-dihydroxy-t-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene ( BPDE)-DNA antiserum , which measures both BPdG and the other stable BP-DNA adducts . When mice were fed 100 ppm BP for 28 days , BP-induced DNA damage measured in esophagus , liver and lung was typically higher in Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice , compared with WT mice . This result is consistent with the previously observed tumor susceptibility of Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice . BPdG , the major DNA adduct associated with tumorigenicity , was the primary DNA adduct formed in esophagus ( a target tissue in the mouse ) , whereas total BP-DNA adducts predominated in higher levels in the liver ( a non-target tissue in the mouse ) . In an attempt to lower BP-induced DNA damage , we fed the WT and Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice 0.3% chlorophyllin ( CHL ) in the BP-containing diet for 28 days . The addition of CHL resulted in an increase of BP-DNA adducts in esophagus , liver and lung of WT mice , a lowering of BPdG in esophagi of WT mice and livers of Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice and an increase of BPdG in livers of WT mice . Therefore , the addition of CHL to a BP-containing diet showed a lack of consistent chemoprotective effect , indicating that oral CHL administration may not reduce PAH-DNA adduct levels consistently in human organs .
The Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres ( ALT ) pathway is a telomerase-independent pathway for telomere maintenance that is active in a significant subset of human cancers and in vitro immortalized cell lines . ALT is thought to involve templated extension of telomeres through homologous recombination , but the genetic or epigenetic changes that unleash ALT are not known . Recently , mutations in the ATRX/DAXX chromatin remodeling complex and histone H3.3 were found to correlate with features of ALT in pancreatic neuroendocrine cancers , pediatric glioblastomas , and other tumors of the central nervous system , suggesting that these mutations might contribute to the activation of the ALT pathway in these cancers . We have taken a comprehensive approach to deciphering ALT by applying genomic , molecular biological , and cell biological approaches to a panel of 22 ALT cell lines , including cell lines derived in vitro . Here we show that loss of ATRX protein and mutations in the ATRX gene are hallmarks of ALT-immortalized cell lines . In addition , ALT is associated with extensive genome rearrangements , marked micronucleation , defects in the G2/M checkpoint , and altered double-strand break ( DSB ) repair . These attributes will facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of ALT positive human cancers .
In a screen for thoracic malignancy-associated markers , thyroid stimulating hormone receptor ( TSHR ) was identified as a candidate as it binds to the previously-characterized lung cancer marker NKX2-1 . We screened for mutations in all coding regions of the TSHR gene in 96 lung adenocarcinoma samples and their matched adjacent normal lung samples . We found one patient with a somatic mutation at codon 458 ( exon 10 ) , which is located at the transmembrane domain where most TSHR mutations have been found in thyroid-related diseases . This patient had lung adenocarcinoma with BAC ( bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ) features in the setting of a prior medical history significant for carotid stenosis and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . In order to characterize the genetic features of TSHR in lung cancer , we checked for TSHR expression and copy number in the 96 lung cancer tissues . TSHR protein expression was generally overexpressed in multiple thoracic malignancies ( adenocarcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma and malignant pleural mesothelioma ) by immunohistochemistry . Our data suggest that aberrant TSHR function may contribute to lung cancer development or a subgroup of lung cancer with specific clinical phenotypes .
BACKGROUND Agricultural products and by products provide the primary materials for a variety of technological applications in diverse industrial sectors . Agro-industrial wastes , such as cotton and curaua fibers , are used to prepare nanofibers for use in thermoplastic films , where they are combined with polymeric matrices , and in biomedical applications such as tissue engineering , amongst other applications . The development of products containing nanofibers offers a promising alternative for the use of agricultural products , adding value to the chains of production . However , the emergence of new nanotechnological products demands that their risks to human health and the environment be evaluated . This has resulted in the creation of the new area of nanotoxicology , which addresses the toxicological aspects of these materials . PURPOSE AND METHODS Contributing to these developments , the present work involved a genotoxicological study of different nanofibers , employing chromosomal aberration and comet assays , as well as cytogenetic and molecular analyses , to obtain preliminary information concerning nanofiber safety . The methodology consisted of exposure of Allium cepa roots , and animal cell cultures ( lymphocytes and fibroblasts ) , to different types of nanofibers . Negative controls , without nanofibers present in the medium , were used for comparison . RESULTS The nanofibers induced different responses according to the cell type used . In plant cells , the most genotoxic nanofibers were those derived from green , white , and brown cotton , and curaua , while genotoxicity in animal cells was observed using nanofibers from brown cotton and curaua . An important finding was that ruby cotton nanofibers did not cause any significant DNA breaks in the cell types employed . CONCLUSION This work demonstrates the feasibility of determining the genotoxic potential of nanofibers derived from plant cellulose to obtain information vital both for the future usage of these materials in agribusiness and for an understanding of their environmental impacts .
The role of energy deregulation and altered/adapted metabolism in tumor cells is an increasingly important issue in understanding cancer . Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma ( HLRCC ) is an aggressive form of RCC characterized by germline mutation of fumarate hydratase ( FH ) , followed by somatic loss of the remaining wild-type allele and known to be a highly metastatic and lethal malignancy compared to other RCCs . The intrinsic loss of normal tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle presumably aids tumorigenesis due to the necessary metabolic alterations required and the enforced dependence on glycolysis derived energy , mimicking the Warburg effect . Thus , there is considerable utility in establishing a preclinical cell model from these tumors to study energy metabolism deregulation , as well as developing new targeted therapeutic approaches for TCA cycle enzyme-deficient cancers . Here , we describe a new immortalized cell line , UOK268 , derived from a patient's primary HLRCC-associated kidney cancer . This represents the first primary renal cell line to model TCA cycle gene loss and provides a perfect partner cell line to our previously described metastasis-derived HLRCC-associated cell line , UOK262 . We identified a novel germline FH missense mutation , p.His192Asp , and the subsequent loss of heterozygosity in UOK268 . The UOK268 cell line expressed mutant FH protein , which localized to the mitochondria , but with loss of almost all catalytic activity . The UOK268 cells had severely compromised oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolytic flux . Ingenuity pathways analysis of human mitochondria-focused cDNA microarray ( hMitChip3 ) gene chip data confirmed the altered mRNA expression patterns of genes involved in several important pathways , such as lipid metabolism , apoptosis , and energy production/glycolysis . UOK268 provides a unique model of a primary cell line demonstrating an enforced , irreversible Warburg effect and , combined with UOK262 , provides a unique invitro preclinical model for studying the bioenergetics of the Warburg effect in human cancer .
To evaluate a radioprotective effect of sodium n-propyl thiosulfate ( NPTS ) and sodium 2-propenyl thiosulfate ( 2PTS ) derived from onions and garlic , respectively , rat hepatoma H4IIE cells and mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells were preincubated with each of these compounds for 48 hours at 37degreesC before receiving 10 Gy of X-ray irradiation . Cell damage caused by the irradiation was quantified as comet tail moment , which represents the degree of DNA damage . X-ray-induced DNA damage was significantly decreased in both H4IIE and L5178Y cells by micromolar concentrations of NPTS and 2PTS compared with the control without the compounds . The protective effect was more potent with 2PTS than NPTS . Onions and garlic have antiradiation potential .
Cellular senescence has emerged as a critical tumor suppressive mechanism in recent years , but relatively little is known about how senescence occurs . Here , we report that secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 ( SFRP1 ) , a secreted antagonist of Wnt signaling , is oversecreted upon cellular senescence caused by DNA damage or oxidative stress . SFRP1 is necessary for stress-induced senescence caused by these factors and is sufficient for the induction of senescence phenotypes . We present evidence suggesting that SFRP1 functions as a secreted mediator of senescence through inhibition of Wnt signaling and activation of the retinoblastoma ( Rb ) pathway and that cancer-associated SFRP1 mutants are defective for senescence induction .
Anal canal cancer is a rare tumor without clear treatment evidence in the metastatic setting . In terms of the bad prognosis of patients with metastatic anal cancer , further therapeutic options are urgently needed . In this paper we present the case of a 64-year-old man suffering from undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma with liver metastases . After progression on cisplatin and fluorouracil , tumor tissue was analyzed with respect to anti-EGFR therapy with cetuximab . There was no KRAS mutation and the EGFR expression level in the tumor tissue was 2+ ; ideal conditions for the immunotherapy . Encouraged by these results we started a therapy using FOLFIRI in combination with cetuximab . Fortunately the patient showed a partial response after 6 cycles . On patient's preference we did a therapy break of 6 weeks . Within this time period the disease was progressive indicating its aggressiveness . However , the same immunotherapy was able to stabilize the disease for a further 3 months . The patient died 21 months after diagnosis because of liver failure . Nevertheless , from our perspective the combination of FOLFIRI and cetuximab is quite a promising therapeutic option for patients with metastatic anal cancer . Potential predictive factors of the immunochemotherapy are discussed in this paper .
Background . An important goal of personalized cancer therapy is to tailor specific therapies to the mutational profile of individual patients . However , whole genome sequencing studies have shown that the mutational profiles of cancers evolve over time and often differ between primary and metastatic sites . Activating point mutations in the PIK3CA gene are common in primary breast cancer tumors , but their presence in breast cancer bone metastases has not been assessed previously . Results . Fourteen patients with breast cancer bone metastases were biopsied by three methods : CT-guided bone biopsies ; bone marrow trephine biopsies ; and bone marrow aspiration . Samples that were positive for cancer cells were obtained from six patients . Three of these patients had detectable PIK3CA mutations in bone marrow cancer cells . Primary tumor samples were available for four of the six patients assessed for PIK3CA status in their bone metastases . For each of these , the PIK3CA mutation status was the same in the primary and metastatic sites . Conclusions . PIK3CA mutations occur frequently in breast cancer bone metastases . The PIK3CA mutation status in bone metastases samples appears to reflect the PIK3CA mutation status in the primary tumour . Breast cancer patients with bone metastases may be candidates for treatment with selective PIK3CA inhibitors .
Certain mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population . Several factors contribute to this increased frequency , including consanguineous marriages and an event known as a " bottleneck " , which occurred in the past and caused a drastic reduction in the genetic variability of this population . Several studies were performed over the years in an attempt to elucidate the role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in susceptibility to breast cancer . The aim of this study was to estimate the carrier frequency of certain common mutations in the BRCA1 ( 185delAG and 5382insC ) and BRCA2 ( 6174delT ) genes in an Ashkenazi Jewish population from Porto Alegre , Brazil . Molecular analyses were done by PCR followed by RFLP ( ACRS ) . The carrier frequencies for BRCA1 185delAG and 5382insC were 0.78 and 0 respectively , and 0.4 for the BRCA2 6174deT mutation . These findings are similar to those of some prior studies but differ from others , possibly due to excluding individuals with a personal or family history of cancer . Our sample was drawn from the community group and included individuals with or without a family or personal history of cancer . Furthermore , increased dispersion among Ashkenazi subpopulations may be the result of strong genetic drift and/or admixture . It is therefore necessary to consider the effects of local admixture on the mismatch distributions of various Jewish populations .
The most potent tumorigen identified among the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) is the nonplanar fjord region dibenzo[a,l]pyrene ( DB[a,l]P ) . It is metabolically activated in vivo through the widely studied diol epoxide ( DE ) pathway to form covalent adducts with DNA bases , predominantly guanine and adenine . The ( +)-11S,12R,13R,14S DE enantiomer forms adducts via its C14 position with the exocyclic amino group of guanine . Here , we present the first nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of a DB[a,l]P-derived adduct , the 14R-(+)-trans-anti-DB[a,l]P-N(2)-dG ( DB[a,l]P-dG ) lesion in double-stranded DNA . In contrast to the stereochemically identical benzo[a]pyrene-derived N(2)-dG adduct ( B[a]P-dG ) in which the B[a]P rings reside in the B-DNA minor groove on the 3'-side of the modifed deoxyguanosine , in the DB[a,l]P-derived adduct the DB[a,l]P rings intercalate into the duplex on the 3'-side of the modified base from the sterically crowded minor groove . Watson-Crick base pairing of the modified guanine with the partner cytosine is broken , but these bases retain some stacking with the bulky DB[a,l]P ring system . This new theme in PAH DE-DNA adduct conformation differs from ( 1 ) the classical intercalation motif in which Watson-Crick base pairing is intact at the lesion site and ( 2 ) the base-displaced intercalation motif in which the damaged base and its partner are extruded from the helix . The structural considerations that lead to the intercalated conformation of the DB[a,l]P-dG lesion in contrast to the minor groove alignment of the B[a]P-dG adduct , and the implications of the DB[a,l]P-dG conformational motif for the recognition of such DNA lesions by the human nucleotide excision repair apparatus , are discussed .
Chromosomal translocations typically impair cell differentiation and often require secondary mutations for malignant transformation . However , the role of a primary translocation in the development of collaborating mutations is debatable . To delineate the role of leukemic translocation NUP98-HOXD13 ( NHD13 ) in secondary mutagenesis , DNA break and repair mechanisms in stimulated mouse B lymphocytes expressing NHD13 were analyzed . Our results showed significantly reduced expression of non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ)-mediated DNA repair genes , DNA Pkcs , DNA ligase4 , and Xrcc4 leading to cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase . Our results showed that expression of NHD13 fusion gene resulted in impaired NHEJ-mediated DNA break repair .
Several germline single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) have been identified in the POLB gene , but little is known about their cellular and biochemical impact . DNA Polymerase \u03b2 ( Pol \u03b2 ) , encoded by the POLB gene , is the main gap-filling polymerase involved in base excision repair ( BER ) , a pathway that protects the genome from the consequences of oxidative DNA damage . In this study we tested the hypothesis that expression of the POLB germline coding SNP ( rs3136797 ) in mammalian cells could induce a cancerous phenotype . Expression of this SNP in both human and mouse cells induced double-strand breaks , chromosomal aberrations , and cellular transformation . Following treatment with an alkylating agent , cells expressing this coding SNP accumulated BER intermediate substrates , including single-strand and double-strand breaks . The rs3136797 SNP encodes the P242R variant Pol \u03b2 protein and biochemical analysis showed that P242R protein had a slower catalytic rate than WT , although P242R binds DNA similarly to WT . Our results suggest that people who carry the rs3136797 germline SNP may be at an increased risk for cancer susceptibility .
Oncogene-induced senescence can provide a protective mechanism against tumour progression . However , production of cytokines and growth factors by senescent cells may contribute to tumour development . Thus , it is unclear whether induction of senescence represents a viable therapeutic approach . Here , using a mouse model with orthotopic implantation of metastatic melanoma tumours taken from 19 patients , we observed that targeting aurora kinases with MLN8054/MLN8237 impaired mitosis , induced senescence and markedly blocked proliferation in patient tumour implants . Importantly , when a subset of tumour-bearing mice were monitored for tumour progression after pausing MLN8054 treatment , 50% of the tumours did not progress over a 12-month period . Mechanistic analyses revealed that inhibition of aurora kinases induced polyploidy and the ATM/Chk2 DNA damage response , which mediated senescence and a NF-kappaB-related , senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) . Blockade of IKKbeta/NF-kappaB led to reversal of MLN8237-induced senescence and SASP . Results demonstrate that removal of senescent tumour cells by infiltrating myeloid cells is crucial for inhibition of tumour re-growth . Altogether , these data demonstrate that induction of senescence , coupled with immune surveillance , can limit melanoma growth .
BACKGROUND Phosphorylation of the H2AX histone is an early indicator of DNA double-strand breaks and of the resulting DNA damage response . In the present study , we assessed the expression and prognostic significance of \u03b3-H2AX in a cohort of 96 patients with operable non-small cell lung carcinoma . METHODS Ninety-six paraffin-embedded specimens of non-small cell lung cancer patients were examined . All patients underwent radical thoracic surgery of primary tumor ( lobectomy or pneumonectomy ) and regional lymph node dissection. \u03b3-H2AX expression was assessed by standard immunohistochemistry . Follow-up was available for all patients ; mean duration of follow-up was 27.50 +/- 14.07 months ( range 0.2-57 months , median 24 months ) . RESULTS Sixty-three patients ( 65.2% ) died during the follow-up period . The mean survival time was 32.2 +/- 1.9 months ( 95% confidence interval [ CI ] : 28.5-35.8 months ; median 30.0 months ) ; 1- , 2- and 3-year survival rates were 86.5% +/- 3.5% , 57.3% +/- 5.1% , and 37.1% +/- 5.4% , respectively . Low \u03b3-H2AX expression was associated with a significantly better survival as compared with those having high \u03b3-H2AX expression ( 35.3 months for low \u03b3-H2AX expression versus 23.2 months for high \u03b3-H2AX expression , P = 0.009 ; hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.95 , 95% CI : 1.15-3.30 ) . Further investigation with multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that high expression of \u03b3-H2AX remained an independent prognostic factor of shorter overall survival ( HR 2.15 , 95% CI : 1.22-3.79 , P = 0.026 ) . A combined p53/\u03b3-H2AX analysis was performed , and we found that the p53 low/\u03b3-H2AX low phenotype was associated with significantly better survival compared with all other phenotypes . CONCLUSION Our study is the first to demonstrate that expression of \u03b3-H2AX detected by immunohistochemistry may represent an independent prognostic indicator of overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer . Further studies are needed to confirm our results .
Many molecular mechanisms contribute to the development of doxorubicin resistance and different cancers can express wide and diverse arrays of drug-resistance genes . The aim of this study was to identify the changes in gene expression associated with the development of doxorubicin resistance in MCF7 breast cancer cell line . The doxorubicin resistant MCF7 cell line was developed by stepwise selection of MCF7 cells and was tested using the MTT assay . The alterations in gene expression were examined using the real-time based PCR array . The findings showed an up-regulation of many phase I/II metabolizing genes , specifically , the CYP1A1 and the CYP1A2 that were up-regulated by 206- and 96-fold respectively . Drug efflux pump genes were also up-regulated profoundly . TOP2A was strongly down-regulated by 202-fold . Many other changes were observed in genes crucial for cell cycle , apoptosis and DNA repair . The findings of this project imply that the development of doxorubicin resistance is a multi-factorial process .
Many viruses subvert the host cell's ability to mount and complete various DNA damage responses ( DDRs ) after infection . HCMV infection of permissive fibroblasts activates host DDRs at the time of viral deposition and during replication , but the DDRs remain uncompleted without arrest or apoptosis . We believe this was in part due to partitioning of the damage response and double strand break repair components . After extraction of soluble proteins , the localization of these components fell into three groups : specifically associated with the viral replication centers ( RCs ) , diffused throughout the nucleoplasm and excluded from the RCs . Others have shown that cells are incapable of processing exogenously introduced damage after infection . We hypothesized that the inability of the cells to process damage might be due to the differential association of repair components within the RCs and , in turn , potentially preferential repair of the viral genome and compromised repair of the host genome . To test this hypothesis we used multiple strategies to examine repair of UV-induced DNA damage in mock and virus-infected fibroblasts . Comet assays indicated that repair was initiated , but was not completed in infected cells . Quantitative analysis of immunofluorescent localization of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers ( CPDs ) revealed that after 24 h of repair , CPDs were significantly reduced in viral DNA , but not significantly changed in the infected host DNA . To further quantitate CPD repair , we developed a novel dual-color Southern protocol allowing visualization of host and viral DNA simultaneously . Combining this Southern methodology with a CPD-specific T4 endonuclease V alkaline agarose assay to quantitate repair of adducts , we found efficient repair of CPDs from the viral DNA but not host cellular DNA . Our data confirm that NER functions in HCMV-infected cells and almost exclusively repairs the viral genome to the detriment of the host's genome .
Genomic instability drives tumorigenesis , but how it is initiated in sporadic neoplasias is unknown . In early preneoplasias , alterations at chromosome fragile sites arise due to DNA replication stress . A frequent , perhaps earliest , genetic alteration in preneoplasias is deletion within the fragile FRA3B/FHIT locus , leading to loss of Fhit protein expression . Because common chromosome fragile sites are exquisitely sensitive to replication stress , it has been proposed that their clonal alterations in cancer cells are due to stress sensitivity rather than to a selective advantage imparted by loss of expression of fragile gene products . Here , we show in normal , transformed , and cancer-derived cell lines that Fhit-depletion causes replication stress-induced DNA double-strand breaks . Using DNA combing , we observed a defect in replication fork progression in Fhit-deficient cells that stemmed primarily from fork stalling and collapse . The likely mechanism for the role of Fhit in replication fork progression is through regulation of Thymidine kinase 1 expression and thymidine triphosphate pool levels ; notably , restoration of nucleotide balance rescued DNA replication defects and suppressed DNA breakage in Fhit-deficient cells . Depletion of Fhit did not activate the DNA damage response nor cause cell cycle arrest , allowing continued cell proliferation and ongoing chromosomal instability . This finding was in accord with in vivo studies , as Fhit knockout mouse tissue showed no evidence of cell cycle arrest or senescence yet exhibited numerous somatic DNA copy number aberrations at replication stress-sensitive loci . Furthermore , cells established from Fhit knockout tissue showed rapid immortalization and selection of DNA deletions and amplifications , including amplification of the Mdm2 gene , suggesting that Fhit loss-induced genome instability facilitates transformation . We propose that loss of Fhit expression in precancerous lesions is the first step in the initiation of genomic instability , linking alterations at common fragile sites to the origin of genome instability .
Lesion-specific enzymes repair different forms of DNA damage , yet all lesions elicit the same checkpoint response . The common intermediate required to mount a checkpoint response is thought to be single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) , coated by replication protein A ( RPA ) and containing a primer-template junction . To identify factors important for initiating the checkpoint response , we screened for genes that , when overexpressed , could amplify a checkpoint signal to a weak allele of chk1 in fission yeast . We identified Ast1 , a novel member of the XPG-related family of endo/exonucleases . Ast1 promotes checkpoint activation caused by the absence of the other XPG-related nucleases , Exo1 and Rad2 , the homologue of Fen1 . Each nuclease is recruited to DSBs , and promotes the formation of ssDNA for checkpoint activation and recombinational repair . For Rad2 and Exo1 , this is independent of their S-phase role in Okazaki fragment processing . This XPG-related pathway is distinct from MRN-dependent responses , and each enzyme is critical for damage resistance in MRN mutants . Thus , multiple nucleases collaborate to initiate DNA damage responses , highlighting the importance of these responses to cellular fitness .
Topoisomerase 1 ( Top1)-DNA cleavage complexes induced by camptothecin ( CPT ) cause DNA strand breaks during DNA replication or transcription . Although the cellular responses to replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks have been well studied , the responses to transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks have not . Here , we show that poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) and cockayne syndrome group B protein ( CSB ) modulate the CPT-induced formation of discrete p53-binding protein 1 ( 53BP1 ) nuclear foci at sites of transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks . Inhibition of PARP activity enhanced the formation of these foci , while knockdown of essential components of the base excision repair ( BER ) pathway did not . These findings suggest that PARP suppresses transcription-mediated 53BP1 foci formation , but that this does not occur through the BER pathway . In addition , knockdown of CSB , one of the key factors of transcription-coupled repair , slowed the kinetics of 53BP1 foci formation . These data suggest that PARP and CSB modulate the formation of 53BP1 foci during the processing of transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks .
In normal human cells , oncogene-induced senescence ( OIS ) depends on induction of DNA damage response . Oxidative stress and hyperreplication of genomic DNA have been proposed as major causes of DNA damage in OIS cells . Here , we report that down-regulation of deoxyribonucleoside pools is another endogenous source of DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts ( NHFs ) undergoing HRAS(G12V)-induced senescence . NHF-HRAS(G12V) cells underexpressed thymidylate synthase ( TS ) and ribonucleotide reductase ( RR ) , two enzymes required for the entire de novo deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis , and possessed low dNTP levels . Chromatin at the promoters of the genes encoding TS and RR was enriched with retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein and histone H3 tri-methylated at lysine 9 . Importantly , ectopic coexpression of TS and RR or addition of deoxyribonucleosides substantially suppressed DNA damage , senescence-associated phenotypes , and proliferation arrest in two types of NHF-expressing HRAS(G12V) . Reciprocally , short hairpin RNA-mediated suppression of TS and RR caused DNA damage and senescence in NHFs , although less efficiently than HRAS(G12V) . However , overexpression of TS and RR in quiescent NHFs did not overcome proliferation arrest , suggesting that unlike quiescence , OIS requires depletion of dNTP pools and activated DNA replication . Our data identify a previously unknown role of deoxyribonucleotides in regulation of OIS .
Lowering the threshold of cellular senescence , the process employed by cells to thwart abnormal cell proliferation , though inhibition of CDK2 or Skp2 ( regulator of CDK inhibitors ) has been recently suggested as a potential avenue for cancer treatment . In this study , we employ a published mathematical model of G1/S transition involving the DNA-damage signal transduction pathway to conduct carefully constructed computational experiments to highlight the effectiveness of manipulating cellular senescence in inhibiting damaged cell proliferation . We first demonstrate the suitability of the mathematical model to explore senescence by highlighting the overlap between senescence pathways and those involved in G1/S transition and DNA damage signal transduction . We then investigate the effect of CDK2 deficiency on senescence in healthy cells , followed by effectiveness of CDK2 deficiency in triggering senescence in DNA damaged cells . For this , we focus on the behaviour of CycE , whose peak response indicates G1/S transition , for several reduced CDK2 levels in healthy as well as two DNA-damage conditions to calculate the probability ( \u03b2 ) or the percentage of CDK2 deficient cells passing G1/S checkpoint ( (1-\u03b2) indicates level of senescence ) . Results show that 50% CDK2 deficiency can cause senescence in all healthy cells in a fairly uniform cell population ; whereas , most healthy cells ( \u224867% ) in a heterogeneous population escape senescence . This finding is novel to our study . Under both low- and high-DNA damaged conditions , 50% CDK deficiency can cause 65% increase in senescence in a heterogeneous cell population . Furthermore , the model analyses the relationship between CDK2 and its CKIs ( p21 , p27 ) to help search for other effective ways to bring forward cellular senescence . Results show that the degradation rate of p21 and initial concentration of p27 are effective in lowering CDK2 levels to lower the senescence threshold . Specifically , CDK2 and p27 are the most effective in triggering senescence while p21 having a smaller influence . While receiving experimental support , these findings specify in detail the inhibitory effects of CKIs . However , simultaneous variation of CDK2 and CKIs produces a dramatic reduction of damage cells passing the G1/S with CDK2&p27 combination causing senescence in almost all damaged cells . This combined effect of CDK2&CKIs on senescence is a novel contribution in this study . A review of the crucial protein complexes revealed that the concentration of active CycE/CDK2-p that controls cell cycle arrest provides support for the above findings with CycE/CDK2-p undergoing the largest reduction ( over 100% ) under the combined CDK2&CKI conditions leading to the arrest of most of the damaged cells . Our study thus provides quantitative assessments for the previously published qualitative findings on senescence and highlights new avenues for bringing forward senescence bar .
Our study was to elucidate the mechanisms whereby BMS-345541 ( BMS , a specific I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 inhibitor ) inhibits the repair of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) and evaluate whether BMS can sensitize MCF-7 breast cancer cells ( MCF-7 cells ) to ionizing radiation ( IR ) in an apoptosis-independent manner . In this study , MCF-7 cells were exposed to IR in vitro and in vivo with or without pretreatment of BMS . The effects of BMS on the repair of IR-induced DSBs by homologous recombination ( HR ) and non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) were analyzed by the DR-GFP and EJ5-GFP reporter assays and IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX , 53BP1 , Brca1 and Rad51 foci assays . The mechanisms by which BMS inhibits HR were examined by microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription PCR . The effects of BMS on the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to IR were determined by MTT and clonogenic assays in vitro and tumor growth inhibition in vivo in a xenograft mouse model . The results showed that BMS selectively inhibited HR repair of DSBs in MCF-7 cells , most likely by down-regulation of several genes that participate in HR . This resulted in a significant increase in the DNA damage response that sensitizes MCF-7 cells to IR-induced cell death in an apoptosis-independent manner . Furthermore , BMS treatment sensitized MCF-7 xenograft tumors to radiation therapy in vivo in an association with a significant delay in the repair of IR-induced DSBs . These data suggest that BMS is a novel HR inhibitor that has the potential to be used as a radiosensitizer to increase the responsiveness of cancer to radiotherapy .
N-Ras is one member of a family of oncoproteins that are commonly mutated in cancer . Activating mutations in N-Ras occur in a subset of colorectal cancers , but little in known about how the mutant protein contributes to onset and progression of the disease . Using genetically engineered mice , we find that mutant N-Ras strongly promotes tumorigenesis in the context of inflammation . The pro-tumorigenic nature of mutant N-Ras is related to its anti-apoptotic function , which is mediated by activation of a non-canonical MAPK pathway that signals through Stat3 . As a result , inhibition of MEK selectively induces apoptosis in autochthonous colonic tumors expressing mutant N-Ras . The translational significance of this finding is highlighted by our observation that NRAS mutation correlates with a less favorable clinical outcome for colorectal cancer patients . These data demonstrate for the first time the important role that N-Ras plays in colorectal cancer .
SMG1 is a member of the phosphoinositide kinase-like kinase family of proteins that includes ATM , ATR , and DNA-PK , proteins with known roles in DNA damage and cellular stress responses . SMG1 has a well-characterized role in nonsense-mediated decay as well as suggested roles in the DNA damage response , resistance to oxidative stress , regulation of hypoxic responses , and apoptosis . To understand the roles of SMG1 further , we generated a Genetrap Smg1 mouse model . Smg1 homozygous KO mice were early embryonic lethal , but Smg1 heterozygous mice showed a predisposition to a range of cancers , particularly lung and hematopoietic malignancies , as well as development of chronic inflammation . These mice did not display deficiencies in known roles of SMG1 , including nonsense-mediated decay . However , they showed elevated basal tissue and serum cytokine levels , indicating low-level inflammation before the development of tumors . Smg1 heterozygous mice also showed evidence of oxidative damage in tissues . These data suggest that the inflammation observed in Smg1 haploinsufficiency contributes to susceptibility to cancer and that Smg1-deficient animals represent a model of inflammation-enhanced cancer development .
In mammalian cells more than 90% of double-strand breaks are repaired by NHEJ . Impairment of this pathway is associated with cell cycle arrest , cell death , genomic instability and cancer . Human diseases such as Nijmegen breakage syndrome , due to mutations in the NBS1 gene , produce defects in resection of double-strand breaks . NBS1 hypomorphic mutant mice are viable , and cells from these mice are defective in S phase and G2/M checkpoints . NBS1 polymorphisms have been associated with increased risk of breast cancer . We previously demonstrated that estradiol protected estrogen receptor ( ER)-positive ( + ) breast cancer cell lines against double-strand breaks and cell death . We now demonstrate that protection from double-strand break damage in ER+ cells is mediated via regulation by c-myc , p53 , CBP and SRC1 coactivators in intron 1 of the NBS1 gene . We concluded that NBS1 is responsible for estradiol-mediated protection from double-strand breaks in ER+ breast cancer cells .
The effects of genomic changes in hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) on the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) are still unclear , especially in relation to the genotype of HBV . In this study , we examined the effects of genomic changes in HBV of genotype C2 on the development of HCC . A total of 318 patients with HBV-associated HCC and 234 patients with chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) were studied . All of HCC cases were diagnosed histologically and treated with surgical resection . The whole of the X , S , basal core promoter ( BCP ) and precore regions of the viral genome from sera or liver tissues were sequenced . All subjects had HBV of genotype C2 . The prevalence of the T1653 mutation in the X region and the A1896 mutation in the precore region of HBV was significantly higher in the HCC group than in the control CHB group ( 22% vs 11% , P = 0.003 ; 50% vs 23% , P < 0.001 , respectively ) . Moreover , the T1762/A1764 mutations in the BCP region in combination with either T1653 or A1896 were more common in the HCC compared with the CHB group ( BCP+X1653 : 18% vs 11% , P = 0.05 ; BCP+PC , 40% vs 15% , P < 0.001 , respectively ) . In multivariate analysis , T1653 and A1896 were revealed to be independent risk factors for HCC development . G1896A in the precore region and C1653T mutation in the X region of genotype C2 HBV are important risk factors for HCC development . Also , the A1762T/G1764A double mutation may act in synergy with C1653T to increase the risk of HCC in patients chronically infected with HBV genotype C2 .
BACKGROUND DNA-damaging compounds ( e.g. , alkylating agents , cytotoxic antibiotics and DNA topoisomerase poisons ) are the most widely used anticancer drugs . The inability of tumor cells to properly repair some types of DNA damage may explain why specific DNA-damaging drugs can selectively kill tumor cells . Phenylglyoxal is a dicarbonyl compound known to react with guanidine groups such as that of the DNA base guanine , therefore suggesting that phenylglyoxal could induce DNA damage and have anticancer activity . METHODS Cellular DNA damage was measured by the alkaline comet assay and the \u03b3H2AX focus assay . Formation of topoisomerase I- and topoisomerase II-DNA complexes was assessed by the TARDIS assay , an immunofluorescence technique that employs specific antibodies to DNA topo I or topo II to detect the protein covalently bound to the DNA in individual cells . Cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity were determined by XTT , MTT and clonogenic assays . Apoptosis was assessed by the Annexin V flow cytometry assay . RESULTS Phenylglyoxal induced cellular DNA damage and formation of high levels of topoisomerase I- and topoisomerase II-DNA complexes in cells . These topoisomerase-DNA complexes were abolished by catalase pretreatment and correlated well with the induction of apoptosis . Phenylglyoxal-induced cell death was partially prevented by catalase pretreatment and was higher in lung cancer cells ( A549 ) than in normal lung fibroblasts ( MRC5 ) . Mammalian cell lines defective in nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) , homologous recombination ( HR ) and non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) were more sensitive to phenylglyoxal than parental cells ; this suggests that phenylglyoxal may induce bulky distortions in the shape of the DNA double helix ( which are repaired by the NER pathway ) and DNA double-strand breaks ( which are repaired by HR and NHEJ ) . CONCLUSION This report shows that phenylglyoxal is a new DNA-damaging agent with anticancer activity , and suggests that tumor cells with defects in NER , HR and NHEJ may be hypersensitive to the cytotoxic activity of phenylglyoxal .
A new cell line of human ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma ( CCC ) , TU-OC-1 , was established and characterized . The cells showed a polygonal-shaped morphology and grew in monolayers without contact inhibition and were arranged like a jigsaw puzzle . The chromosome numbers ranged from 64 to 90 . A low rate of proliferation was observed , similar to other CCC cell lines tested ( OVTOKO , RMG-I , and OVAS ) , and the doubling time was 38.4h . The respective IC50 values of cisplatin and paclitaxel were 12.2muM and 58.3nM . Mutational analysis revealed that TU-OC-1 cells harbored a PIK3CA mutation at codon 542 ( E542K ) in exon 9 , which is a mutation hot spot on this gene . We observed that phosphorylated Akt protein was overexpressed in TU-OC-1 cells by western blot analysis . Heterotransplantation to nude mice produced tumors that reflected the original . This cell line may be useful to study the chemoresistant mechanisms of CCC and contribute to novel treatment strategies .
RAD51 is a key enzyme of homologous recombination and repair of DNA double-strand breaks . RAD51 mRNA expression levels are significantly increased in laser-microdissected mammary simple carcinomas and their lymph node metastases when compared to adenomas or nonneoplastic mammary gland of the same dog . Here , RAD51 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded mammary carcinomas and their lymph node metastases of 40 dogs , adenomas of 48 dogs , and nonneoplastic mammary gland of 88 dogs . Number of cells with nuclear RAD51 expression was significantly ( P < or = .05 ) increased in carcinomas when compared to adenomas and metastases . In contrast , no significant differences in the number of RAD51-expressing cells were detected when metastases were compared with adenomas and nonneoplastic gland . RAD51 expression in carcinomas was correlated with expression in metastases but not with histologic grade . In conclusion , the increased number of RAD51-expressing cells in carcinomas might indicate genomic instability in these cells . Nevertheless , the increased RAD51 mRNA expression in metastases could not be confirmed by immunohistochemistry .
ATM(Tel1) and ATR(Rad3) checkpoint kinases phosphorylate the C-terminus of histone H2AX ( H2A in yeasts ) in chromatin flanking DNA damage , establishing a recruitment platform for checkpoint and repair proteins . Phospho-H2A/X ( gammaH2A/X)-binding proteins at double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) have been characterized , but those required for replication stress responses are unknown . Here , we present genetic , biochemical , small angle X-ray scattering ( SAXS ) , and X-ray structural studies of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Brc1 , a 6-BRCT-domain protein that is structurally related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rtt107 and mammalian PTIP . Brc1 binds gammaH2A to form spontaneous and DNA damage-induced nuclear foci . Spontaneous Brc1 foci colocalize with ribosomal DNA repeats , a region prone to fork pausing and genomic instability , whereas DNA damage-induced Brc1 foci colocalize with DSB response factors. gammaH2A binding is critical for Brc1 function . The 1.45 A resolution crystal structure of Brc1-gammaH2A complex shows how variable BRCT insertion loops sculpt tandem-BRCT phosphoprotein-binding pockets to facilitate unique phosphoprotein-interaction specificities , and unveils an acidic DNA-mimicking Brc1 surface . From these results , Brc1 docking to gammaH2A emerges as a critical chromatin-specific response to replication-associated DNA damage .
Multivitamin preparation ( MVP ) is part of total parenteral nutrition given to premature infants . Photoactivated MVP carries an important load in peroxides , but their cellular effects have not yet been determined . We hypothesized that these peroxides may elicit a DNA-damage response . We found that photoactivation of MVP and the resulting peroxide production were time-dependent and required the simultaneous presence of ascorbic acid and riboflavin . Cells treated with photoactivated MVP showed strongly stimulated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation , an early DNA-damage response in mammals . Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation stimulation was dependent on the presence of ascorbic acid and riboflavin in the photoactivated MVP . It did not occur in the presence of a specific PARP inhibitor nor in mouse fibroblasts deficient in PARP-1 . Photoactivated MVP was able to induce single- and double-strand breaks in DNA , with a predominance of single-stand breaks . The presence of double-strand breaks was further confirmed using a 53PB1 focus analysis . Finally , photoactivated MVP was shown to be toxic to human cells and induced caspase-independent cell death . These results suggest that photoactivated MVP carries an important toxic load able to damage DNA and induce cell death . This study also emphasizes the importance of protecting MVP solution from light before use in preterm infants .
It is thought that high linear energy transfer ( LET ) radiation induces more complex DNA damage than low-LET particles , specifically clustered DNA damage that causes cells to repair DNA double strand breaks ( DSB ) more slowly and leads to severe biological consequences . The present study aimed to investigate the role of exogenously added glutathione ( GSH ) on ( 12)C-beam ( 287keV/mum ) and ( 7)Li-beam ( 60keV/mum ) induced chromosome aberration ( CA ) formation , particularly on exchange aberration formation . In order to characterize the role of GSH in the joining of DNA DSBs , we induced DNA lesions with bleomycin ( Blem ) in conjunction with either high- or low-LET radiation ( X-rays ) since the chemistry of the free DNA ends created by Blem and X-rays is similar . CHO cells were exposed to reduced GSH at a concentration of 2mM for 3h before radiation . Treatment with Blem ( 20mug/ml ) was carried out for 2h before the cells were exposed to radiation . Our results show that the frequency of chromosomal aberration increases with increased LET . Heavy ion exposed cells show a higher frequency of CA over time than do X-irradiated cells . An analysis of the first post-irradiation mitosis of exposed CHO cells shows that high-LET radiation induces more breaks than exchange-type aberrations and exogenous GSH has no influence on high-LET radiation-induced DNA damage . The DNA lesions induced by low-LET radiation interact relatively strongly with Blem-induced lesions whereas interaction between Blem and high-LET radiations was poor . This could be attributed to differences in repair kinetics and qualitative differences in the DNA lesions induced by Blem and high-LET radiation .
Homologous recombination ( HR ) is essential for repair of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) . Although the mechanisms of RAD-51-DNA filament assembly and strand exchange are well characterized , the subsequent steps of HR are less well defined . Here , we describe a synthetic lethal interaction between the C. elegans helicase helq-1 and RAD-51 paralog rfs-1 , which results in a block to meiotic DSB repair after strand invasion . Whereas RAD-51-ssDNA filaments assemble at meiotic DSBs with normal kinetics in helq-1 , rfs-1 double mutants , persistence of RAD-51 foci and genetic interactions with rtel-1 suggest a failure to disassemble RAD-51 from strand invasion intermediates . Indeed , purified HELQ-1 and RFS-1 independently bind to and promote the disassembly of RAD-51 from double-stranded , but not single-stranded , DNA filaments via distinct mechanisms in vitro . These results indicate that two compensating activities are required to promote postsynaptic RAD-51 filament disassembly , which are collectively essential for completion of meiotic DSB repair .
DNA double strand breaks ( DSBs ) arise from spontaneous DNA damage due to metabolic activities or from direct and indirect damaging effects of stress . DSBs are also formed transiently during such processes as replication , transcription , and DNA repair . The level of DSBs positively correlates with the activities of homologous and nonhomologous DNA repair pathways , which in turn inversely correlate with methylation levels and chromatin structure . Thus , measurement of strand breaks can provide an informative picture of genome stability of a given cell . The use of random oligonucleotide-primed synthesis for the analysis of DSB levels is described . Applications of the assay for quantitative detection of 3'OH , 3'P , or DNA strand breaks at a cleavage site of the deoxyribose residue are discussed .
