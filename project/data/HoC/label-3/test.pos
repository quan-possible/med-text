Glycolysis is known to be the primary energy source in most cancer cells . We investigated here the effect of clotrimazole ( 1-(alpha-2-chlorotrityl)imidazole ) , the antifungal azole derivative , which was recently recognized as calmodulin antagonist , on the levels of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate , the two stimulatory signal molecules of glycolysis , and on ATP content and cell viability in LL/2 Lewis lung carcinoma cells and CT-26 colon adenocarcinoma cells . We found that clotrimazole induced a significant , dose- and time-dependent reduction in the levels of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate , fructose 1,6-bisphosphate , ATP , and cell viability . These findings suggest that clotrimazole causes a reduction in glycolysis and ATP levels , which eventually leads to cell destruction after 3 h of treatment . Since cell proliferation was also reported to be inhibited by calmodulin antagonists , this substance is most promising agent in treatment of cancer by inhibiting both cell proliferation and the glycolytic supply of ATP required for cancer cell growth .
PURPOSE Metabolic dependence on glucose utilisation has been described for different tumours characterised by activation of Akt , upregulation of GLUT1 , M2PK and TKTL1 . To date , however , little is known about glucose metabolism in breast cancer tissue . METHODS We analysed 55 breast cancer specimens , 26 adjacent ductal carcinomas in situ ( DCIS ) and 23 adjacent normal breast tissues for expression of glycolytic markers by immunohistochemistry . RESULTS We found expression of pAkt in 49% , GLUT1 in 25% , M2PK in 68% and TKTL1 in 31% of the tumours investigated . Expression of pAkt and Her2neu are positively correlated with borderline significance ( P = 0.055 ) . Expression of pAkt , GLUT1 and TKTL1 were higher in breast cancer and DCIS than in normal tissue . Surprisingly , M2PK expression was highest in normal breast tissue . CONCLUSIONS We found a glycolytic phenotype in a high percentage of breast cancer samples . Inhibition of glycolysis might evolve as a future option for breast cancer therapy .
PTEN loss of function enhances proliferation , but effects on cellular energy metabolism are less well characterized . We used an inducible PTEN expression vector in a PTEN-null glioma cell line to examine this issue . While proliferation of PTEN-positive cells was insensitive to increases in glucose concentration beyond 2.5mM , PTEN-null cells significantly increased proliferation with increasing glucose concentration across the normal physiologic range to approximately 10mM , coinciding with a shift to glycolysis and " glucose addiction " . This demonstrates that the impact of loss of function of PTEN is modified by glucose concentration , and may be relevant to epidemiologic results linking hyperglycemia to cancer risk and cancer mortality .
In cancer cells , glucose is often converted into lactic acid , which is known as the ' Warburg effect ' . The reason that cancer cells have a higher rate of aerobic glycolysis , but not oxidative phosphorylation , remains largely unclear . Herein , we proposed an epigenetic mechanism of the Warburg effect . Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase-1 ( FBP1 ) , which functions to antagonize glycolysis was downregulated through NF-kappaB pathway in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells . Restoration of FBP1 expression suppressed anchorage-independent growth , indicating the relevance of FBP1 downregulation in carcinogenesis . Indeed , FBP1 was downregulated in gastric carcinomas ( P<0.01 , n=22 ) and gastric cancer cell lines ( 57% , 4/7 ) . Restoration of FBP1 expression reduced growth and glycolysis in gastric cancer cells . Moreover , FBP1 downregulation was reversed by pharmacological demethylation . Its promoter was hypermethylated in gastric cancer cell lines ( 57% , 4/7 ) and gastric carcinomas ( 33% , 33/101 ) . Inhibition of NF-kappaB restored FBP1 expression , partially through demethylation of FBP1 promoter . Notably , Cox regression analysis revealed FBP1 promoter methylation as an independent prognosis predicator for gastric cancer ( hazard ratio : 3.60 , P=0.010 ) . In summary , we found that NF-kappaB functions downstream of Ras to promote epigenetic downregulation of FBP1 . Promoter methylation of FBP1 can be used as a new biomarker for prognosis prediction of gastric cancer . Such an important epigenetic link between glycolysis and carcinogenesis partly explains the Warburg effect .
OBJECTIVES Recently , it was revealed that carnosine inhibits growth of cells isolated from human malignant glioma . In order to understand how this effect is mediated , experiments were performed that addressed a possible influence of carnosine on energy metabolism . METHODS Cells from the glioma line T98G and primary cultured cells from human malignant glioma were cultivated in the presence of carnosine and inhibitors of cellular energy metabolism . As a specific inhibitor for anaerobic glycolysis , oxamate , and as an inhibitor for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation , potassium cyanide , were used , and the influence on ATP production was determined using cell-based assays . RESULTS The experiments identified glycolysis as crucial for ATP production in gliomas . In addition , ATP production by mitochondrial activity did not significantly contribute to ATP production and carnosine was identified to be an inhibitor of the vital anaerobic glycolysis . DISCUSSION Carnosine might be considered as a potential drug for the treatment of malignant glioma or other tumors since it inhibits the glycolytic energy metabolism that is crucial for cancer cells and malignant gliomas as shown in the current study . This is especially interesting since the dipeptide is a naturally occurring substance that should be well tolerated .
Mitochondrial biogenesis , which depends on nuclear as well as mitochondrial genes , occurs in response to increased cellular ATP demand . The nuclear transcriptional factors , estrogen-related receptor alpha ( ERRalpha ) and nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 , are associated with the coordination of the transcriptional machinery governing mitochondrial biogenesis , whereas coactivators of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 ( PGC-1 ) family serve as mediators between the environment and this machinery . In the context of proliferating cells , PGC-1-related coactivator ( PRC ) is a member of the PGC-1 family , which is known to act in partnership with nuclear respiratory factors , but no functional interference between PRC and ERRalpha has been described so far . We explored three thyroid cell lines , FTC-133 , XTC.UC1 and RO 82 W-1 , each characterized by a different mitochondrial content , and studied their behavior towards PRC and ERRalpha in terms of respiratory efficiency . Overexpression of PRC and ERRalpha led to increased respiratory chain capacity and mitochondrial mass . The inhibition of ERRalpha decreased cell growth and respiratory chain capacity in all three cell lines . However , the inhibition of PRC and ERRalpha produced a greater effect in the oxidative cell model , decreasing the mitochondrial mass and the phosphorylating respiration , whereas the nonphosphorylating respiration remained unchanged . We therefore hypothesize that the ERRalpha-PRC complex plays a role in arresting the cell cycle through the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in oxidative cells , and through some other pathway in glycolytic cells .
Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose by aerobic glycolysis , characterized by increased lactate production . This distinctive metabolism involves expression of the embryonic M2 isozyme of pyruvate kinase , in contrast to the M1 isozyme normally expressed in differentiated cells , and it confers a proliferative advantage to tumor cells . The M1 and M2 pyruvate-kinase isozymes are expressed from a single gene through alternative splicing of a pair of mutually exclusive exons . We measured the expression of M1 and M2 mRNA and protein isoforms in mouse tissues , tumor cell lines , and during terminal differentiation of muscle cells , and show that alternative splicing regulation is sufficient to account for the levels of expressed protein isoforms . We further show that the M1-specific exon is actively repressed in cancer-cell lines--although some M1 mRNA is expressed in cell lines derived from brain tumors--and demonstrate that the related splicing repressors hnRNP A1 and A2 , as well as the polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein PTB , contribute to this control . Downregulation of these splicing repressors in cancer-cell lines using shRNAs rescues M1 isoform expression and decreases the extent of lactate production . These findings extend the links between alternative splicing and cancer , and begin to define some of the factors responsible for the switch to aerobic glycolysis .
Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) arises as the consequence of progressive changes from normal epithelial cells through polyp to tumor , and thus is an useful model for studying metabolic shift . In the present study , we studied the metabolomic profiles using high analyte specific gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ( GC/MS ) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC/MS/MS ) to attain a systems-level view of the shift in metabolism in cells progressing along the path to CRC . Colonic tissues including tumor , polyps and adjacent matched normal mucosa from 26 patients with sporadic CRC from freshly isolated resections were used for this study . The metabolic profiles were obtained using GC/MS and LC/MS/MS . Our data suggest there was a distinct profile change of a wide range of metabolites from mucosa to tumor tissues . Various amino acids and lipids in the polyps and tumors were elevated , suggesting higher energy needs for increased cellular proliferation . In contrast , significant depletion of glucose and inositol in polyps revealed that glycolysis may be critical in early tumorigenesis . In addition , the accumulation of hypoxanthine and xanthine , and the decrease of uric acid concentration , suggest that the purine biosynthesis pathway could have been substituted by the salvage pathway in CRC . Further , there was a step-wise reduction of deoxycholic acid concentration from mucosa to tumors . It appears that to gain a growth advantage , cancer cells may adopt alternate metabolic pathways in tumorigenesis and this flexibility allows them to adapt and thrive in harsh environment .
Overexpression of the adverse prognostic marker ERBB2 occurs in 30% of breast cancers ; however , therapies targeting this gene have not proved to be as effective as was initially hoped . Transcriptional profiling meta-analyses have shown that there are approximately 150 genes co-overexpressed with ERBB2 , suggesting that these genes may represent alternative factors influencing ERBB2-positive tumors . Here we describe an RNA interference-based analysis of these genes that identifies transcriptional regulators of fat synthesis and storage as being critical for the survival of these cells . These transcription factors , nuclear receptor subfamily 1 , group D , member 1 ( NR1D1 ) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma binding protein ( PBP ) , both reside on ERBB2-containing 17q12-21 amplicons and are part of the ERBB2 expression signature . We show that NR1D1 and PBP act through a common pathway in upregulating several genes in the de novo fatty acid synthesis network , which is highly active in ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells . Malate dehydrogenase 1 and malic enzyme 1 , enzymes that link glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis , are also regulated by NR1D1 . The resulting high-level fat production from increased expression of these genes likely contributes to an abnormal cellular energy metabolism based on aerobic glycolysis . Together , these results show that the cells of this aggressive form of breast cancer are genetically preprogrammed to depend on NR1D1 and PBP for the energy production necessary for survival .
Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are key regulators of innate and acquired immunity . The maturation of DCs is directed by signal transduction events downstream of toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) and other pattern recognition receptors . Here , we demonstrate that , in mouse DCs , TLR agonists stimulate a profound metabolic transition to aerobic glycolysis , similar to the Warburg metabolism displayed by cancer cells . This metabolic switch depends on the phosphatidyl inositol 3'-kinase/Akt pathway , is antagonized by the adenosine monophosphate ( AMP)-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , and is required for DC maturation . The metabolic switch induced by DC activation is antagonized by the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 . Our data pinpoint TLR-mediated metabolic conversion as essential for DC maturation and function and reveal it as a potential target for intervention in the control of excessive inflammation and inappropriately regulated immune responses .
The c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase ( JNK ) signaling cascade has been implicated in a wide range of diseases , including cancer . It is unclear how different JNK proteins contribute to human cancer . Here , we report that JNK2 is activated in more than 70% of human squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) samples and that inhibition of JNK2 pharmacologically or genetically impairs tumorigenesis of human SCC cells . Most importantly , JNK2 , but not JNK1 , is sufficient to couple with oncogenic Ras to transform primary human epidermal cells into malignancy with features of SCC . JNK2 prevents Ras-induced cell senescence and growth arrest by reducing the expression levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p16 and the activation of NF-kappaB . On the other hand , JNK , along with phosphoinositide 3-kinase , is essential for Ras-induced glycolysis , an energy-producing process known to benefit cancer growth . These data indicate that JNK2 collaborates with other oncogenes , such as Ras , at multiple molecular levels to promote tumorigenesis and hence represents a promising therapeutic target for cancer .
BACKGROUND AND AIM The importance of glycolysis in cancer cells is well documented . The effects of inhibiting glycolysis using metabolic inhibitors iodoacetate ( IAA ) , an inhibitor of GAPDHase , and 3-bromopyruvate ( 3BP ) , an inhibitor of hexokinase-II , on survival and signaling of pancreatic cancer cells ( Panc-1 ) were investigated . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cellular survival was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay . Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) assay was used to analyze the induced necrosis and protein levels were evaluated using Western blot analysis . RESULTS The results show that the inhibitors lowered cellular survival and increased cellular necrosis . Mitogenic signaling pathways were affected by 3BP but not by IAA . CONCLUSION We conclude that there may be a cross-talk between signaling pathways and glycolysis in regulating pancreatic cancer cell survival and signaling . Thus , a combination of agents that inhibit both energy production and cell signaling may provide a novel and effective approach to target pancreatic cancer effectively .
Caveolin-1 ( -/- ) null stromal cells are a novel genetic model for cancer-associated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts . Here , we used an unbiased informatics analysis of transcriptional gene profiling to show that Cav-1 ( -/- ) bone-marrow derived stromal cells bear a striking resemblance to the activated tumor stroma of human breast cancers . More specifically , the transcriptional profiles of Cav-1 ( -/- ) stromal cells were most closely related to the primary tumor stroma of breast cancer patients that had undergone lymph-node ( LN ) metastasis . This is consistent with previous morphological data demonstrating that a loss of stromal Cav-1 protein ( by immuno-histochemical staining in the fibroblast compartment ) is significantly associated with increased LN-metastasis . We also provide evidence that the tumor stroma of human breast cancers shows a transcriptional shift towards oxidative stress , DNA damage/repair , inflammation , hypoxia , and aerobic glycolysis , consistent with the " Reverse Warburg Effect " . Finally , the tumor stroma of " metastasis-prone " breast cancer patients was most closely related to the transcriptional profiles derived from the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease . This suggests that certain fundamental biological processes are common to both an activated tumor stroma and neuro-degenerative stress . These processes may include oxidative stress , NO over-production ( peroxynitrite formation ) , inflammation , hypoxia , and mitochondrial dysfunction , which are thought to occur in Alzheimer?s disease pathology . Thus , a loss of Cav-1 expression in cancer-associated myofibroblasts may be a protein biomarker for oxidative stress , aerobic glycolysis , and inflammation , driving the " Reverse Warburg Effect " in the tumor micro-environment and cancer cell metastasis .
Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose through aerobic glycolysis . This phenomenon , known as the Warburg effect , is an anomalous characteristic of glucose metabolism in cancer cells . Chronic inflammation is a key promoting factor of tumourigenesis . It remains , however , largely unexplored whether and how pro-tumourigenic inflammation regulates glucose metabolism in cancer cells . Here , we show that pro-inflammatory cytokines promote glycolysis in breast cancer cells , and that the inflammation-induced miR-155 functions as an important mediator in this process . We further show that miR-155 acts to upregulate hexokinase 2 ( hk2 ) , through two distinct mechanisms . First , miR-155 promotes hk2 transcription by activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) , a transcriptional activator for hk2 . Second , via targeting C/EBP\u03b2 ( a transcriptional activator for mir-143 ) , miR-155 represses mir-143 , a negative regulator of hk2 , thus resulting in upregulation of hk2 expression at the post-transcriptional level . The miR-155-mediated hk2 upregulation also appears to operate in other types of cancer cells examined . We suggest that the miR-155/miR-143/HK2 axis may represent a common mechanism linking inflammation to the altered metabolism in cancer cells .
While human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) and human embryonal carcinoma cells ( hECCs ) have been studied extensively at the levels of the genome , transcriptome , proteome and epigenome our knowledge of their corresponding metabolomes is limited . Here , we present the metabolic signatures of hESCs and hESCs obtained by untargeted gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) . Whilst some metabolites are common to both cell types , representing the self-renewal and house-keeping signatures , others were either higher ( e.g. , octadecenoic acid , glycerol-3-phosphate , 4-hydroxyproline ) or lower ( e.g. , glutamic acid , mannitol , malic acid , GABA ) in hESCs ( H9 ) compared to hECCs ( NTERA2 ) , these represent cell type specific signatures . Further , our combined results of GC-MS and microarray based gene expression profiling of undifferentiated and OCT4-depleted hESCs are consistent with the Warburg effect which is increased glycolysis in embryonic cells and tumor cells in the presence of O(2) while oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) is impaired or even shut down . RNAi-based OCT4 knock down mediated differentiation resulted in the activation of the poised OXPHOS machinery by expressing missing key proteins such as NDUFC1 , UQCRB and COX , increase in TCA cycle activity and decreased lactate metabolism . These results shed light on the metabolite layer of pluripotent stem cells and could potentially establish novel metabolic markers of self renewal and pluripotency .
BACKGROUND Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) encodes six nuclear transformation-associated proteins that induce extensive changes in cellular gene expression and signaling and induce B-cell transformation . The role of HIF1A in EBV-induced B-cell immortalization has not been previously studied . METHODS AND FINDINGS Using Western blotting and Q-PCR , we found that HIF1A protein is stabilized in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells . Western blotting , GST pulldown assays , and immunoprecipitation showed that EBV-encoded nuclear antigens EBNA-5 and EBNA-3 bind to prolylhydroxylases 1 and 2 , respectively , thus inhibiting HIF1A hydroxylation and degradation . Immunostaining and Q-PCR showed that the stabilized HIF1A translocates to the nucleus , forms a heterodimer with ARNT , and transactivates several genes involved in aerobic glycolysis . Using biochemical assays and Q-PCR , we also found that lymphoblastoid cells produce high levels of lactate , lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate . CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that activation of the aerobic glycolytic pathway , corresponding to the Warburg effect , occurs in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells , in contrast to mitogen-activated B-cells .
The role of energy deregulation and altered/adapted metabolism in tumor cells is an increasingly important issue in understanding cancer . Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma ( HLRCC ) is an aggressive form of RCC characterized by germline mutation of fumarate hydratase ( FH ) , followed by somatic loss of the remaining wild-type allele and known to be a highly metastatic and lethal malignancy compared to other RCCs . The intrinsic loss of normal tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle presumably aids tumorigenesis due to the necessary metabolic alterations required and the enforced dependence on glycolysis derived energy , mimicking the Warburg effect . Thus , there is considerable utility in establishing a preclinical cell model from these tumors to study energy metabolism deregulation , as well as developing new targeted therapeutic approaches for TCA cycle enzyme-deficient cancers . Here , we describe a new immortalized cell line , UOK268 , derived from a patient's primary HLRCC-associated kidney cancer . This represents the first primary renal cell line to model TCA cycle gene loss and provides a perfect partner cell line to our previously described metastasis-derived HLRCC-associated cell line , UOK262 . We identified a novel germline FH missense mutation , p.His192Asp , and the subsequent loss of heterozygosity in UOK268 . The UOK268 cell line expressed mutant FH protein , which localized to the mitochondria , but with loss of almost all catalytic activity . The UOK268 cells had severely compromised oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolytic flux . Ingenuity pathways analysis of human mitochondria-focused cDNA microarray ( hMitChip3 ) gene chip data confirmed the altered mRNA expression patterns of genes involved in several important pathways , such as lipid metabolism , apoptosis , and energy production/glycolysis . UOK268 provides a unique model of a primary cell line demonstrating an enforced , irreversible Warburg effect and , combined with UOK262 , provides a unique invitro preclinical model for studying the bioenergetics of the Warburg effect in human cancer .
Cancer can be envisioned as a metabolic disease driven by pressure selection and intercellular cooperativeness . Together with anaerobic glycolysis , the Warburg effect , formally corresponding to uncoupling glycolysis from oxidative phosphorylation , directly participates in cancer aggressiveness , supporting both tumor progression and dissemination . The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) is a key contributor to glycolysis . It stimulates the expression of glycolytic transporters and enzymes supporting high rate of glycolysis . In this study , we addressed the reverse possibility of a metabolic control of HIF-1 in tumor cells . We report that lactate , the end-product of glycolysis , inhibits prolylhydroxylase 2 activity and activates HIF-1 in normoxic oxidative tumor cells but not in Warburg-phenotype tumor cells which also expressed lower basal levels of HIF-1\u03b1 . These data were confirmed using genotypically matched oxidative and mitochondria-depleted glycolytic tumor cells as well as several different wild-type human tumor cell lines of either metabolic phenotype . Lactate activates HIF-1 and triggers tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo , an activity that we found to be under the specific upstream control of the lactate transporter monocarboxylate transporter 1 ( MCT1 ) expressed in tumor cells . Because MCT1 also gates lactate-fueled tumor cell respiration and mediates pro-angiogenic lactate signaling in endothelial cells , MCT1 inhibition is confirmed as an attractive anticancer strategy in which a single drug may target multiple tumor-promoting pathways .
In cancer , glucose uptake and glycolysis are increased regardless of the oxygen concentration in the cell , a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect . Several ( but not all ) glycolytic enzymes have been investigated as potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment using RNAi . Here , four previously untargeted glycolytic enzymes , aldolase A , glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , triose phosphate isomerase , and enolase 1 , are targeted using RNAi in Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells . Of these enzymes , knockdown of aldolase causes the greatest effect , inhibiting cell proliferation by 90% . This defect is rescued by expression of exogenous aldolase . However , aldolase knockdown does not affect glycolytic flux or intracellular ATP concentration , indicating a non-metabolic cause for the cell proliferation defect . Furthermore , this defect could be rescued with an enzymatically dead aldolase variant that retains the known F-actin binding ability of aldolase . One possible model for how aldolase knockdown may inhibit transformed cell proliferation is through its disruption of actin-cytoskeleton dynamics in cell division . Consistent with this hypothesis , aldolase knockdown cells show increased multinucleation . These results are compared with other studies targeting glycolytic enzymes with RNAi in the context of cancer cell proliferation and suggest that aldolase may be a useful target in the treatment of cancer .
Effective glucose diet : We report the development and activity of glucose-conjugated LDH-A inhibitors designed for dual targeting of the Warburg effect ( elevated glucose uptake and glycolysis ) in cancer cells . Glycoconjugation could be applied to inhibitors of many enzymes involved in glycolysis or tumor metabolism .
High-throughput screening of a small-molecule library identified a 5-triazolo-2-arylpyridazinone as a novel inhibitor of the important glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/2,6-bisphosphatase 3 ( PFKFB3 ) . Such inhibitors are of interest due to PFKFB3's control of the important glycolytic pathway used by cancer cells to generate ATP . A series of analogues was synthesized to study structure-activity relationships key to enzyme inhibition . Changes to the triazolo or pyridazinone rings were not favoured , but limited-size substitutions on the aryl ring provided modest increases in potency against the enzyme . Selected analogues and literature-described inhibitors were evaluated for their ability to suppress the glycolytic pathway , as detected by a decrease in lactate production , but none of these compounds demonstrated such suppression at non-cytotoxic concentrations .
