The effects of an anti-CD3 mAb on induction of non-MHC restricted cytolysis was investigated . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from normal donors ( 29 ) and cancer patients ( 18 ) were cultured in 100 U/ml of interleukin-2 ( rIL-2 ) with and without anti-CD3 mAb ( OKT3 , 10 ng/ml ) for the first 48 hours of incubation . Thereafter , both PBMC cultures were maintained on rIL-2 up to 20 days . PBMC proliferation was enhanced 17-fold in number by day 20 when anti-CD3 mAb and rIL-2 was present during the first 48 hours but only 3-fold by day 20 when rIL-2 alone was present . Concomitantly anti-CD3 mAb but not Lym-1 , an isotype matched control , inhibited the induction of lytic activity against both NK sensitive ( K562 ) and NK resistant ( Raji ) target cell lines . Thus the inhibitory effect is dependent on anti-CD3 mAb stimulating the CD3/TCR T-cell receptor complex . While lytic activity was dependent on the concentration of rIL-2 , inhibition of the induction phase of non-MHC restricted lytic activity was independent of the concentration of rIL-2 . Flow cytometry analysis indicated that treatment with the anti-CD3 mAb increased the percentage of CD3 positive cells , CD4 positive cells and especially CD25 positive cells , but decreased th percentage of CD56 positive cells . Supernatants from anti-CD3 mAb stimulated cultures also inhibited the induction of non-MHC restricted lytic activity . Lymphokine analysis showed that supernatants of anti-CD3 mAb stimulated cultures had higher levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma . However , TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma alone or in combination could not mediate the inhibitory effect . The inhibitory factor(s) was partially purified by sequential chromatography on matrices of controlled pore glass and Sepharose CL-6B . The molecular weight of the inhibitory factor(s) was less than 67K . These studies have identified a novel regulatory pathway controlling non-MHC restricted cytolysis . Perturbation of the T-cell CD3/TCR complex with the anti-CD3 mAb results in the secretion of a soluble mediator that down-regulates the induction of rIL-2 dependent non-MHC restricted cytolysis .
HER-2/neu gene expression , DNA ploidy and proliferation index were studied in 250 cases of breast cancer . Expression of HER-2/neu was determined by using an antibody to the HER-2/neu receptor . Ki-67 antibody was used to determine the proliferation index of the breast cancers , and the Feulgen method was used to assess DNA amounts in the tumor cells . Histochemical staining was quantitated by image analysis . Of the cancers studied , 72 were positive for overexpression of HER-2/neu protein ; of these , 62 ( 86% ) possessed near-tetraploid DNA content , and 47 ( 65% ) had more than one G0G1 stem line ( polyploid ) of DNA distribution . Cells from the cases negative for HER/2-neu overexpression contained DNA amounts that ranged from diploid to varying degrees of aneuploid . A significant difference in the amounts of cellular proliferation in HER-2/neu overexpressing cancers was found between those that expressed the HER-2/neu receptor on their membranes and those that exhibited mainly cytoplasmic receptors .
A new cell line , CB109 , has been established from a human glioblastoma multiforme . The cytoskeleton was positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein , vimentin and fibronectin . Hyaluronan ( HA ) and the HA-binding protein hyaluronectin ( HN ) were expressed in the cell cytoplasm and in the extracellular matrix of spheroids and plated cells . Hyaluronidase did not prevent spheroid formation suggesting that HA was not involved in the cell-cell adhesion . HA precoating prevented cell adherence to the plates and favoured spheroid formation . HA was secreted in relatively large amounts into the culture medium . High performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that HA was in the high molecular weight form . The rate of HN secretion by cells was very low . Basic fibroblast growth factor significantly increased the proliferation in vitro and tumour growth after grafting into nude mice . The epidermal growth factor receptor was not expressed on cultivated CB109 cells . Cytogenetic analysis showed polysomy 7 , structural rearrangement of chromosome 10 short arm and a translocation 13q13-q14 without detectable alteration of the RB gene .
Cell kinetics and activity of ornithine decarboxylase ( ODC ) were studied during the process of 1-hydroxyanthraquinone ( 1-HA)-induced intestinal carcinogenesis in rats . Starting at 6 weeks of age , a total of 37 male ACI/N rats were divided into two groups and treated as follows : group I ( 18 rats ) received diet containing 1% 1-HA for 12 months ; group II ( 19 rats ) was given the basal diet alone . Sub-groups of 5-7 rats were sequentially killed at 4 , 8 and 12 months for evaluation of the length , cell numbers and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine ( BrDU ) labeling indices of large bowel crypts together with ODC activity . All kinetic and ODC data indicated increased DNA synthesis and proliferation at all time points . Morphological observation of the intestines also revealed melanosis , crypt abscesses and erosion , becoming more pronounced with length of exposure to the anthraquinone . The data thus suggest that cell proliferation in the crypts of the cecum or colon is important for 1-HA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis .
Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor is inversely related to expression of estrogen receptor ( ER ) and progesterone receptor in primary breast tumors and is a negative predictor for response to endocrine therapy . To investigate a possible causal role of EGF receptor expression in breast cancer progression to hormone independence , we have created an experimental cell system . Epidermal growth factor receptor complementary DNA was introduced in estrogen-dependent ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells , and the resulting ZR/HERc cells exhibited a mitogenic response to epidermal growth factor , thus bypassing estrogen dependence . This EGF-induced proliferation could not be inhibited by antiestrogens . In addition , we noted changes in cell morphology and keratin expression of EGF-stimulated ZR/HERc cells , suggestive of an altered differentiation state . Furthermore , intolerance of functional ER and EGF receptor signal transduction pathways in ZR/HERc cells was observed during simultaneous activation , which possibly explains the inverse relationship of ER and EGF receptor expression in primary tumors . In contrast to the parental cells , ZR/HERc cells rapidly progressed to a stable ER-negative phenotype when cultured in the presence of the antiestrogen hydroxy-tamoxifen . These results suggest a possible role for EGF receptor in progression of breast cancer to hormone independence .
AIM The goal of this study was to characterize the AFP receptor , its possible signal transduction pathway and its proliferative functions in human hepatoma cell line Bel 7402 . METHODS Cell proliferation enhanced by AFP was detected by MTT assay , 3H-thymidine incorporation and S-stage percentage of cell cycle analysis . With radioactive labeled 125I-AFP for receptor binding assay ; cAMP accumulation , protein kinase A activity were detected by radioactive immunosorbent assay and the change of intracellular free calcium ( Ca2+i ) was monitored by scanning fluorescence intensity under TCS-NT confocal microscope . The expression of oncogenes N- ras , p 53 , and p21( ras ) in the cultured cells in vitro were detected by Northern blotting and Western blotting respectively . RESULTS It was demonstrated that AFP enhanced the proliferation of human hepatoma Bel 7402 cell in a dose dependent fashion as shown in MTT assay , ( 3)H-thymidine incorporation and S-phase percentage up to 2-fold . Two subtypes of AFP receptors were identified in the cells with Kds of 1.3 x 10(-9)mol.L(-1) and 9.9 x10(-8)mol . ( -1)L respectively . Pretreatment of cells with AFP resulted in a significant increase ( 625% ) in cAMP accumulation . The activity of protein kinase A activity were increased up to 37.5 , 122.6 , 73.7 and 61.2% at treatment time point 2 , 6 , 12 and 24 hours . The level of intracellular calcium were elevated after the treatment of alpha-fetoprotein and achieved to 204% at 4 min . The results also showed that AFP(20mg.L(-1)) could upregulate the expression of N- ras oncogenes and p 53 and p21( ras ) in Bel 7402 cells . In the later case,the alteration were 81.1%(12h) and 97.3%(12h) respectively compared with control . CONCLUSION These results demonstrate that AFP is a potential growth factor to promote the proliferation of human hepatoma Bel 7402 cells . Its growth-regulatory effects are mediated by its specific plasma membrane receptors coupled with its transmembrane signaling transduction through the pathway of cAMP-PKA and intracellular calcium to regulate the expression of oncogenes .
OBJECTIVE Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) secondary to EGFR gene amplification is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and a worse clinical outcome . The purpose of this study was to analyze whether blocking this receptor with the anti-EGFR chimeric monoclonal antibody C225 would decrease proliferation and increase apoptosis in GBM cells . METHODS EGFR expression and amplification were analyzed for seven human GBM cell lines . These lines were then exposed to different concentrations of C225 for 48 hours , 72 hours , and 7 days , after which time cytotoxicity , apoptosis , and vascular endothelial growth factor expression were assessed in vitro . Two EGFR-amplified human GBM were implanted in the flanks of nude mice , and the animals received C225 twice per week intraperitoneally for 5 weeks . Tumor volumes and survival times were compared with those of sham-treated mice . RESULTS EGFR gene amplification was demonstrated in three of the primary GBM lines . C225 treatment produced significant cytotoxicity in all three EGFR-amplified GBM lines , but not in unamplified lines . Flow cytometry demonstrated increased apoptosis in C225-treated , EGFR-amplified GBM lines , but not in unamplified lines . There was a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor expression in all GBM lines with exposure to C225 . Tumor-bearing mice treated with C225 experienced significant inhibition of tumor growth as well as a 200% increase in median survival . CONCLUSION Blocking EGFR in GBM cells that overexpress this receptor significantly changes tumor cell biology by promoting apoptosis while decreasing proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor expression . This approach holds great promise for the treatment of patients with GBMs .
Human fibroblasts undergo cellular senescence after a finite number of divisions , in response to the erosion of telomeres . In addition to being terminally arrested in the cell cycle , senescent fibroblasts express genes that are normally induced upon wounding , including genes that remodel the extracellular matrix . We have identified the novel zinc finger protein APA-1 , whose expression increased in senescent human fibroblasts independent of telomere shortening . Extended passage , telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts had increased levels of APA-1 as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 . In fibroblasts , APA-1 was modified by the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1 , which increased APA-1 half-life , possibly by blocking ubiquitin-mediated degradation . Overexpression of APA-1 did not cause cell cycle arrest ; but , it induced transcription of the extracellular matrix-remodeling genes MMP1 and PAI2 , which are associated with fibroblast senescence . MMP1 and PAI2 transcript levels also increased in telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts that had high levels of APA-1 , demonstrating that the matrix-remodeling phenotype of senescent fibroblasts was not induced by telomere attrition alone . APA-1 was able to transactivate and bind to the MMP1 promoter , suggesting that APA-1 is a transcription factor that regulates expression of matrix-remodeling genes during fibroblast senescence .
In an attempt to find a strategy to modulate the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells , we examined whether constitutive activation of proto-oncogen protein p21 ( Ras ) induced the reentry of confluent human umbilical vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) into the S phase . When an adenovirus construct expressing a constitutively active Ras mutant ( Ad/RasG12V ) was infected into HUVECs , their morphology changed strikingly and they appeared to be transformed . However , Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs did not enter the S phase , as determined by assessing 3H-thymidine incorporation . In accordance with the above results , the expression of cyclin A both at the transcript and protein levels did not increase in Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs relative to that in control cells , although the expression of cyclin D1 was induced in Ad/RasG12V-infected cells . Interestingly , the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor p21cip1 was remarkably increased while that of p27kip1 did not decrease in Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs . Furthermore , CDK2 activity was not induced in Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs . These results suggested that the constitutive activation of Ras promoted the reentry of confluent HUVECs in the G0 phase into the G1 phase , but not into the S phase . The results also indicated that the constitutive activation of Ras might have induced the persistent expression of p21cip1 and p27kip1 , and that this induction of p21cip1 and p27kip1 expression possibly caused the cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase .
Purpose of this work was to synthesize several cis-/trans- isomer pairs of the platinum(II) complexes , and study the extent and the mode of their antiproliferative activity on HeLa cells . Six platinum(II) isomer pairs have a general formula cis-/trans-[PtA2X2] , where A is ligand : ammonia ( NH3 ) , pyridine ( Py ) ; and X is ligand : chloride ion ( Cl- ) , bromide ion ( Br- ) , iodide ion ( I- ) , thiocyanato ion ( SCN- ) ; four compounds have different structural formulas , and these are cis-/trans-[Pt(NH2OH)2(NH3)2]Cl2 , and cis-/trans-Pt(Gly)2 , where Gly is bidentate glycinato ligand . Results of the MTT assay , showed that six cis- and one trans-platinum(II) complexes exhibited cytotoxicity ( IC50 ) ranging between 5 and 33 microM . Most of the cis-platinum(II) isomers caused significant alteration of cell cycle phases progression , and induced apoptosis in degree that varied among different compounds , as evaluated using flowcytometry and morphological study . Spectrophotometric analysis ( AAS ) indicated that there is no correlation between intracellular platinum(II) accumulation and cytotoxicity of tested complexes .
Recent surveys indicate that Pi intake has increased steadily as Pi-containing foods have increased . Our previous study demonstrated that high dietary Pi strongly stimulated lung tumorigeneis . In order to answer the issue whether low Pi may be chemopreventive , we examined the effects of low Pi on lung cancer . Eighteen 5-wk-old male K-ras(LA1) lung cancer model mice were randomly allocated to 2 groups . One group was fed a normal diet ( 0.5% Pi ) and other group was fed low Pi ( 0.1% Pi ) diet for 4 wk . Lung cancer development was evaluated by histopathological examination , Western blot , kinase assay , and immunohistochemistry . Low Pi increased the expression of sodium-dependent phosphate co-transporter 2b , and activated Akt signal with decreased PTEN expression in the lungs of K-ras(LA1) mice . Low Pi increased the Akt/mTOR-mediated protein translation through upregulating the phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 . In addition , low Pi stimulated cell cycling as evidenced by altered cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D1 and D3 . Finally , low Pi increased lung tumorigenesis in K-ras(LA1) mice compared to the normal diet group . Our results clearly demonstrated that low Pi also promoted lung tumorigenesis , thus suggesting that an appropriate intake of dietary Pi may be critical for lung cancer prevention as well as treatment .
BACKGROUND The incidence of ovarian cancer has been increasing worldwide and it is currently the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancy . Unlike breast cancer , the prognostic role of the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( HER-2 ) in ovarian carcinoma remains controversial . METHODS The aim of this preclinical study was to further characterise the biological , molecular and cellular effects of trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) using NIH-OVCAR-3 and derived cell lines both in vitro and in vivo . RESULTS In vitro assessments have shown that trastuzumab treatment inhibited total and phosphorylated HER-2 . This was associated with inhibition of the phosphorylated form of phosphatase and tensin homologue ( PTEN ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT , and the total level of p27(kip) . Inhibition of PTEN is associated with phosphorylated MEK1/2 upregulation , suggesting a specific inhibition of the protein phosphatase function of PTEN . Moreover , trastuzumab induced the upregulation of RhoB . These molecular modifications promote inhibition of cell migration and potentially restoration of tumour cell contact inhibition . RhoB induction in NIH-OVCAR-3 control cell lines mimics the molecular and cellular trastuzumab long-time exposition effects . RhoB inhibition in NIH-OVCAR-3 long-time exposed to trastuzumab cell line reverses the cellular and molecular effects observed in this model . In vivo examinations have shown that these changes are also associated with the restoration of structural , morphological and normal functions of the peritoneum of an ovarian carcinoma mouse model . CONCLUSION These results provide an indication of the mechanisms underlying the anti-tumour activity of trastuzumab that strongly implicate RhoB in an ovarian carcinoma model that does not show HER-2 amplification or overexpression . These findings highlight that trastuzumab effects involve a possible cross-talk between RhoB and PTEN in the early stages of tumour re-growth in a model of micrometastatic ovarian cancer .
INTRODUCTION The HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir is currently under investigation as a new anti-cancer drug . Several studies have shown that nelfinavir induces cell cycle arrest , endoplasmic reticulum stress , autophagy , and apoptosis in cancer cells . In the present article , the effect of nelfinavir on human breast cancer cells is examined and potential combination treatments are investigated . METHODS The effects of nelfinavir and tamoxifen on the human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 , T47 D , MDA-MB-453 , and MDA-MB-435 were tested by analysing their influence on cell viability ( via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay ) , apoptosis ( annexin binding , poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage ) , autophagy ( autophagy marker light chain 3B expression ) , endoplasmic reticulum stress ( binding protein and activating transcription factor 3 expression ) , and the occurrence of oxidative stress ( intracellular glutathione level ) . RESULTS Nelfinavir induced apoptosis in all four breast cancer cell lines tested , although the extent of autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress varied among the cell lines . The concentration of nelfinavir needed for an efficient induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells could be reduced from 15 mug/ml to 6 mug/ml when combined with tamoxifen . At a concentration of 6 mug/ml , tamoxifen substantially enhanced the endoplasmic reticulum stress reaction in those cell lines that responded to nelfinavir with binding protein ( BiP ) upregulation ( MCF7 , T47D ) , and enhanced autophagy in cell lines that responded to nelfinavir treatment with autophagy marker light chain 3B upregulation ( MDA-MB-453 ) . Although tamoxifen has been described to be able to induce oxidative stress at concentrations similar to those applied in this study ( 6 mug/ml ) , we observed that nelfinavir but not tamoxifen reduced the intracellular glutathione level of breast cancer cells within hours of application by up to 32% , suggesting the induction of oxidative stress was an early event and an additional cause of the apoptosis induced by nelfinavir . CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrate that nelfinavir may be an effective drug against breast cancer and could be combined with tamoxifen to enhance its efficacy against breast cancer cells . Moreover , the cytotoxic effect of a tamoxifen and nelfinavir combination was independent of the oestrogen receptor status of the analysed breast cancer cells , suggesting a potential benefit of a combination of these two drugs even in patients with no hormone-responsive tumours . We therefore recommend that clinical studies on nelfinavir with breast cancer patients should include this drug combination to analyse the therapeutic efficacy as well as the safety and tolerability of this potential treatment option .
INTRODUCTION Natural herbal compounds with novel actions different from existing breast cancer ( BCa ) treatment modalities are attractive for improving therapeutic efficacy and safety . We have recently shown that penta-1,2,3,4,6-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose ( PGG ) induced S-phase arrest in prostate cancer ( PCa ) cells through inhibiting DNA replicative synthesis and G(1) arrest , in addition to inducing cell death at higher levels of exposure . We and others have shown that PGG through intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection exerts a strong in vivo growth suppression of human PCa xenograft models in athymic nude mice . This study aims to test the hypothesis that the novel targeting actions of PGG are applicable to BCa cells , especially those lacking proven druggable targets . METHODS Mono-layer cell culture models of p53-wild type estrogen receptor ( ER)-dependent MCF-7 BCa cells and p53-mutant ER-/progesterone receptor ( PR)- and Her2-regular ( triple-negative ) MDA-MB-231 BCa were exposed to PGG for a comprehensive investigation of cellular consequences and molecular targets/mediators . To test the in vivo efficacy , female athymic mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231 xenograft were treated with 20mg PGG/kg body weight by daily gavage starting 4 days after cancer cell inoculation . RESULTS Exposure to PGG induced S-phase arrest in both cell lines as indicated by the lack of 5-bromo2'-deoxy-uridine ( BrdU ) incorporation into S-phase cells as well as G(1) arrest . Higher levels of PGG induced more caspase-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 , in strong association with induction of P53 Ser(15) phosphorylation , than in MDA-MB-231 cells . The cell cycle arrests were achieved without an induction of cyclin dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitory proteins P21(Cip1) and P27(Kip1) . PGG treatment led to decreased cyclin D1 in both cell lines and over-expressing cyclin D1 attenuated G(1) arrest and hastened S arrest . In serum-starvation synchronized MCF-7 cells , down-regulation of cyclin D1 was associated with de-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma ( Rb ) protein by PGG shortly before G(1)-S transition . In vivo , oral administration of PGG led to a greater than 60% inhibition of MDA-MB231 xenograft growth without adverse effect on host body weight . CONCLUSIONS Our in vitro and in vivo data support PGG as a potential drug candidate for breast cancer with novel targeting actions , especially for a triple negative BCa xenograft model .
Cancer cells undergo multi-step processes in obtaining the ability to metastasize , and are constantly exposed to signals that induce apoptosis . Acquisition of anti-apoptotic properties by cancer cells is important for metastasis , and recent studies suggest that transforming growth factor ( TGF)-beta promotes the survival of certain types of cancer cells . Here , we found that in highly metastatic breast cancer cells , JygMC(A) , JygMC(B) and 4T1 , TGF-beta ligands were produced in autocrine fashion . Pharmacological inhibition of endogenous TGF-beta signalling by a TGF-beta type I receptor kinase inhibitor in serum-free conditions increased the expression of BH3-only protein , Bim ( also known as Bcl2-like 11 ) in JygMC(A) and JygMC(B) cells , and caused apoptotic cell death . We also found that induction of Bim by TGF-beta was not observed in Foxc1 knocked-down cancer cells . These findings suggest that TGF-beta plays a crucial role in the regulation of survival of certain types of cancer cells through the TGF-beta-Foxc1-Bim pathway , and that specific inhibitors of TGF-beta signalling might be useful as apoptosis inducers in breast cancer cells .
Ceramide induces cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death associated with increased levels of p27(kip1) . The aim of this study was to examine the effects of ceramide on p27(kip1) protein levels as a measure of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis . Results showed that ceramide increased p27(kip1) protein levels through activation of protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) in PC-3 prostate cancer cells . Treatment of cells with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid or with PP2A-Calpha siRNA inhibited ceramide-induced enhanced p27(kip1) protein expression and Akt dephosphorylation , and prevented Skp2 downregulation . Overexpression of constitutively active Akt attenuated ceramide-induced Skp2 downregulation and p27(kip1) upregulation . In addition , ceramide stimulated binding of the PP2A catalytic subunit PP2A-Calphabeta to Akt as assessed by immunoprecipitation experiments , indicating that PP2A is involved in the induction of p27(kip1) via inhibition of Akt pathway . Finally , whether PP2A can regulate p27(kip1) expression independently of Akt pathway was determined . Knockdown of PP2A-Calpha with siRNA reduced p27(kip1) levels in the presence of Akt inhibitor . These data reveal that PP2A is a regulator of ceramide-induced p27(kip1) expression via Akt-dependent and Akt-independent pathways .
INTRODUCTION During selective segregation of DNA , a cell asymmetrically divides and retains its template DNA . Asymmetric division yields daughter cells whose genome reflects that of the parents ' , simultaneously protecting the parental cell from genetic errors that may occur during DNA replication . We hypothesized that long-lived epithelial cells are present in immortal , premalignant cell populations , undergo asymmetric division , retain their template DNA strands , and cycle both during allometric growth and during pregnancy . METHODS The glands of 3-week old immune competent Balb/C female mice were utilized intact or cleared of host epithelium and implanted with ductal-limited , lobule-limited , or alveolar-ductal progenitor cells derived from COMMA-D1 pre-malignant epithelial cells. 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine ( 5-BrdU ) was administered to identify those cells which retain their template DNA . Nulliparous mice were then either injected with [ (3)H]-thymidine ( (3)H-TdR ) to distinguish 5-BrdU-label retaining cells that enter the cell cycle and euthanized , or mated , injected with ( 3)H-TdR , and euthanized at various days post-coitus . Sections were stained for estrogen receptor-alpha(ER-alpha) or progesterone receptor ( PR ) via immunohistochemistry . Cells labelled with both 5-BrdU and ( 3)H-TdR were indicative of label-retaining epithelial cells ( LREC ) . RESULTS Cells that retained a 5-BrdU label and cells labelled with [ (3)H]-thymidine were found in all mice and were typically detected along the branching epithelium of mature mouse mammary glands . Cells containing double-labelled nuclei ( LREC ) were found in the intact mammary gland of both pregnant and nulliparous mice , and in mammary glands implanted with pre-malignant cells . Double-labelled cells ( (3)H-TdR/5-BrdU ) represent a small portion of cells in the mammary gland that cycle and retain their template DNA ( 5-BrdU ) . Some label-retaining cells were also ER-alpha or PR positive . LRECs distributed their second label ( (3)H-TdR ) to daughter cells ; and this effect persisted during pregnancy . LRECs , and small focal hyperplasia , were found in all immortalized premalignant mammary implant groups . CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that a subpopulation of long-lived , label-retaining epithelial cells ( LRECs ) is present in immortal premalignant cell populations . These LRECs persist during pregnancy , retain their original DNA , and a small percentage express ER-alpha and PR . We speculate that LRECs in premalignant hyperplasia represent the long-lived ( memory ) cells that maintain these populations indefinitely .
OBJECTIVES Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) stimulates cell proliferation by binding to its receptor ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) , and the overexpression of this receptor is associated with poorer prognosis . The EGF gene presents a polymorphism at position 61 ( A/G ) , associated with higher EGF production . We examined the association between this polymorphism and cervical cancer through a case-control study . METHODS This study used the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method on a sample of 384 women with cervical lesions and 500 controls of white ethnicity . RESULTS In cases of cervical cancer , we found an increased risk of progression to advanced disease ( The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIb/IV ) ( odds ratios=2.05 ; 95% confidence intervals=1.11 to 3.79 ; P=0.021 ) , and this risk was particularly evident in G carriers for younger women ( odds ratios=2.96 ; 95% confidence intervals=1.41-6.20 , P=0.003 ) . CONCLUSIONS We hypothesize the onset of an advanced disease-driven selective pressure due to the effect of oncogenic human papillomavirus types in a favorable genetic background observed in G carrier women . These results suggest that EGF functional polymorphism may influence cervical cancer prognosis through an EGF/epidermal growth factor receptor pathway .
We present a novel gain-of-function mutation of TGF-beta receptor II ( TbetaRII ) found in human oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) . Expression of E221V/N238I mutant TbetaRII enhanced TGF-beta signaling . Mutation of TbetaRII conferred cells higher migratory and invasive capabilities and MMP-2 activity . In mouse tumor model , mutant tumors exhibited poor differentiation and E-cadherin relocalization to the cytosol . Lipid-raft-dependent endocytosis of TbetaRII was attenuated in mutant TbetaRII , suggesting that enhancement of TGF-beta signaling by this mutation is due to delayed TbetaRII internalization . Taken together , our results show a novel gain-of-function TbetaRII mutation , which enhances TGF-beta signaling leading to more invasive phenotypic changes in human OSCC .
Histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi ) are promising epigenetic cancer chemotherapeutics rapidly approaching clinical use . In this study , we tested using in vitro and in vivo models the differential biological effects of a novel HDAC inhibitor [ belinostat ( PXD101) ] , in a wide panel of androgen-sensitive and androgen-independent tumor cells . Belinostat significantly increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 . Belinostat potently inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cell lines ( IC50 range from 0.5 to 2.5 <FFFD>M ) with cytotoxic activity preferentially against tumor cells . This agent induced G2/M arrest and increased significantly the percentage of apoptosis mainly in androgen-sensitive tumor cells confirming its growth-inhibitory effects . The cell death mechanisms were studied in three different prostate cancer cell lines with different androgen dependence and expression of androgen receptor ; LAPC-4 and 22rv1 ( androgen-dependent and expressing androgen receptor ) and PC3 ( androgen-independent not expressing androgen receptor ) . Belinostat induced the expression of p21 and p27 , acetylation of p53 and G2/M arrest associated with Bcl2 and Bcl-Xl downmodulation and significant reduction of survivin , IAPs and Akt/pAkt and increased caspase-8 and -9 expression/activity . Belinostat effectiveness was dependent on the androgen receptor ( AR ) , since the stable transfection of AR greatly increased the efficacy of this HDAC inhibitor . These observations were correlated using in vivo models . We demonstrated that belinostat preferentially resulted in antitumor effect in androgen-dependent tumor cells expressing AR . Our findings provide evidence that belinostat may be a promising anticancer drug for prostate cancer expressing AR , supporting its clinical role in prostate cancer .
Heat shock protein 27 ( Hsp27 ) is emerging as a promising therapeutic target for treatment of various cancers . Although the role of Hsp27 in protection from stress-induced intrinsic cell death has been relatively well studied , its role in Fas ( death domain containing member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily)-induced apoptosis and cell proliferation remains underappreciated . Here , we show that Hsp27 silencing induces dual coordinated effects , resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation and sensitization of cells to Fas-induced apoptosis through regulation of PEA-15 ( 15-kDa phospho-enriched protein in astrocytes ) . We demonstrate that Hsp27 silencing suppresses proliferation by causing PEA-15 to bind and sequester extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) , resulting in reduced translocation of ERK to the nucleus . Concurrently , Hsp27 silencing promotes Fas-induced apoptosis by inducing PEA-15 to release Fas-associating protein with a novel death domain ( FADD ) , thus allowing FADD to participate in death receptor signaling . Conversely , Hsp27 overexpression promotes cell proliferation and suppresses Fas-induced apoptosis . Furthermore , we show that Hsp27 regulation of PEA-15 activity occurs in an Akt-dependent manner . Significantly , Hsp27 silencing in a panel of phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 ( PTEN ) wild-type or null cell lines , and in LNCaP cells that inducibly express PTEN , resulted in selective growth inhibition of PTEN-deficient cancer cells . These data identify a dual coordinated role of Hsp27 in cell proliferation and Fas-induced apoptosis via Akt and PEA-15 , and indicate that improved clinical responses to Hsp27-targeted therapy may be achieved by stratifying patient populations based on tumor PTEN expression .
Hormone-dependent estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) breast cancers generally respond well to anti-estrogen therapy . Unfortunately , hormone-independent estrogen receptor negative ( ER- ) breast cancers are aggressive , respond poorly to current treatments and have a poor prognosis . New approaches and targets are needed for the prevention and treatment of ER- breast cancer . The NF-kappaB signaling pathway is strongly implicated in ER- tumor genesis , constituting a possible target for treatment . Hydrogen sulfide-releasing aspirin ( HS-ASA ) , a novel and safer derivative of aspirin , has shown promise as an anti-cancer agent . We examined the growth inhibitory effect of HS-ASA via alterations in cell proliferation , cell cycle phase transitions , and apoptosis , using MDA-MB-231 cells as a model of triple negative breast cancer . Tumor xenografts in mice , representing human ER- breast cancer , were evaluated for reduction in tumor size , followed by immunohistochemical analysis for proliferation , apoptosis and expression of NF-kappaB . HS-ASA suppressed the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells by induction of G(0)/G(1) arrest and apoptosis , down-regulation of NF-kappaB , reduction of thioredoxin reductase activity , and increased levels reactive oxygen species . Tumor xenografts in mice , were significantly reduced in volume and mass by HS-ASA treatment . The decrease in tumor mass was associated with inhibition of cell proliferation , induction of apoptosis and decrease in NF-kappaB levels in vivo . HS-ASA has anti-cancer potential against ER- breast cancer and merits further study .
The Ras association domain family 1 isoform A ( RASSF1A ) is a tumor suppressor whose inactivation is implicated in the development of many human cancers , including breast carcinomas . Little is known about the tumor-suppressive function of RASSF1A in breast tissue and whether its inactivation is mechanistically involved in the initiation and progression of breast tumors . Here , we show that RASSF1A inhibits breast cancer growth in vivo , and suppresses estrogen receptor ( ERalpha ) expression and function . Reconstitution of RASSF1A in MCF7 cells led to decreased ERalpha levels and reduced sensitivity to estrogen ( E2 ) . Concomitantly , we observed decreased expression of Id1 as well as the E2-responsive genes Bcl-2 and c-Myc that cooperatively contribute to the immortalization and transformation of breast epithelial cells . This downregulation was associated with induction of cell-cycle arrest and senescence that constitute early barriers to cancer initiation and progression . Knockdown of ERalpha showed that downregulation of ERalpha suffices to increase senescence and inhibit expression of Bcl-2 , c-Myc and Id1 . However , enforced expression of ERalpha only partially rescued RASSF1A-mediated growth inhibition and senescence , suggesting that suppression of ERalpha expression and activity is not the only mechanism by which RASSF1A inhibits growth and survival of breast cancer cells . Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 , c-Myc and Id1 had little or no effect on RASSF1A-mediated growth arrest , indicating that RASSF1A acts dominantly over these oncogenes . Mechanistically , RASSF1A was found to suppress ERalpha expression through Akt1 . It also transiently inhibited ERalpha-induced Ras-MAPK activity after exposure of cells to E2 . Together , our data show that RASSF1A acts as a tumor suppressor in ERalpha+ mammary epithelial cells , in part through inhibiting ERalpha expression and activity . These findings suggest that RASSF1A has a key role in suppressing the transformation of human breast epithelial cells and ERalpha+ breast cancer initiation .
Stable ectopic expression of Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase is usually performed in interleukin 3 ( IL-3)-dependent murine cell lines like Ba/F3 , resulting in loss of IL-3 dependence . Such high-level Flt3 expression has to date not been reported in human acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cell lines , despite the fact that oncogenic Flt3 aberrancies are frequent in AML patients . We show here that ectopic Flt3 expression in different human cancer cell lines might reduce proliferation and induce apoptotic cell death , involving Bax/Bcl2 modulation . Selective depletion of Flt3-expressing cells occurred in human AML cell lines transduced with retroviral Flt3 constructs , shown here using the HL-60 leukemic cell line . Flt3 expression was investigated in two cellular model systems , the SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cell line and the human embryonic kidney HEK293 cell line , and proliferation was reduced in both systems . HEK293 cells underwent apoptosis upon ectopic Flt3 expression and cell death could be rescued by overexpression of Bcl-2 . Furthermore , we observed that the Flt3-induced inhibition of proliferation in HL-60 cells appeared to be Bax-dependent . Our results thus suggest that excessive Flt3 expression has growth-suppressive properties in several human cancer cell lines .
Bladder cancer is one of the most common tumors of the genitourinary tract ; however , the molecular events underlying growth and invasion of the tumor remain unclear . Here , role of the CXCR7 receptor in bladder cancer was further explored . CXCR7 protein expression was examined using high-density tissue microarrays . Expression of CXCR7 showed strong epithelial staining that correlated with bladder cancer progression . In vitro and in vivo studies in bladder cancer cell lines suggested that alterations in CXCR7 expression were associated with the activities of proliferation , apoptosis , migration , invasion , angiogenesis and tumor growth . Moreover , CXCR7 expression was able to regulate expression of the proangiogenic factors IL-8 or VEGF , which may involve in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis . Finally , we found that signaling by the CXCR7 in bladder cancer cells activates AKT , ERK and STAT3 pathways . The AKT and ERK pathways may reciprocally regulate , which are responsible for in vitro and in vivo epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) process of bladder cancer . Simultaneously targeting the two pathways by using U0126 and LY294002 inhibitors or using CCX733 , a selective CXCR7 antagonist drastically reduced CXCR7-induced EMT process . Taken together , our data show for the first time that CXCR7 plays a role in the development of bladder cancer . Targeting CXCR7 or its downstream-activated AKT and ERK pathways may prove beneficial to prevent metastasis and provide a more effective therapeutic strategy for bladder cancer .
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K)/AKT and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways are activated in a wide range of human cancers . In many cases , concomitant inhibition of both pathways is necessary to block proliferation and induce cell death and tumor shrinkage . Several feedback systems have been described in which inhibition of one intracellular pathway leads to activation of a parallel signaling pathway , thereby decreasing the effectiveness of single-agent targeted therapies . In this study , we describe a feedback mechanism in which MEK inhibition leads to activation of PI3K/AKT signaling in EGFR and HER2-driven cancers . We found that MEK inhibitor-induced activation of PI3K/AKT resulted from hyperactivation of ERBB3 as a result of the loss of an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation in the conserved juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2 . Mutation of this amino acid led to increased ERBB receptor activation and upregulation of the ERBB3/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway , which was no longer responsive to MEK inhibition . Taken together , these results elucidate an important , dominant feedback network regulating central oncogenic pathways in human cancer .
BACKGROUND Special AT-rich binding protein-1 ( SATB1 ) reprograms chromatin organization and transcription profiles to promote tumour growth and metastasis . AIMS This study aimed to confirm the effects of SATB1 on the growth and metastasis of liver cancer and its specific regulation mechanism . METHODS SATB1 expression was evaluated in human hepatoma tissue , adjacent noncancerous tissue and seven kinds of liver cancer cell lines . Cell cycle , cell proliferation , apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) was investigated after enhanced or silenced expression of SATB1 . The regulatory action of SATB1 on the expression of genes that are known to regulate cell cycle progression , apoptosis and EMT and the specific apoptotic pathway on which it acts were further analysed . Nude mice that received subcutaneous implantation were used to study the effects of SATB1 on tumour growth in vivo . RESULTS Our data show that the high expression of SATB1 was observed in the human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue ( 26/45 ) and liver cancer cell lines with high metastatic potential . SATB1 upregulated CDK4 and downregulated p16 ( INK ) ( 4A ) to promote cell cycle progression and cell proliferation and prevented apoptosis by inhibiting the FADD-caspase-8-caspase-3 death receptor-mediated apoptosis pathway . SATB1 also induced EMT concomitant with increased expression of Snail1 , Slug , Twist and vimentin and decreased expression of E-cadherin , tight junction protein ZO-1 and desmoplakin . SATB1 promoted the growth of tumour in vivo . CONCLUSION These data suggest that the SATB1 gene may play an important role in the development and progression of liver cancer by regulation of genes related to cell cycle progression , apoptosis and EMT .
The effects of 17beta-estradiol ( E2 ) are mediated through activation of estrogen receptors ( ER ) : ERalpha and ERbeta . It is known that ERalpha/ERbeta ratio is higher in breast tumors than in normal tissue . Since antioxidant enzymes and uncoupling proteins ( UCPs ) are reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production and mitochondrial biogenesis regulators , our aim was to study the E2-effect on oxidative stress , antioxidant enzyme expression , and UCPs in breast cancer cell lines with different ERalpha/ERbeta ratios . The lower ERalpha/ERbeta ratio T47D cell line showed low ROS production and high UCP5 levels . However , the higher ERalpha/ERbeta ratio MCF-7 cell line showed an up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes and UCPs , yet exhibited high oxidative stress . As a result , a decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities and UCP2 protein levels , coupled with an increase in oxidative damage was found . On the whole , these results show different E2-effects on oxidative stress regulation , modulating UCPs , and antioxidant enzymes , which were ERalpha/ERbeta ratio dependent in breast cancer cell lines .
Cancer cells typically display altered glucose metabolism characterized by a preference of aerobic glycolysis , known as the Warburg effect , which facilitates cell proliferation . Hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) and oncoprotein Myc are two prominent transcription factors that drive glycolysis . Previously , we reported that the estrogen-related receptors ( ERRs ) act as cofactors of HIF and enhance HIF-dependent transcription of glycolytic genes under hypoxia . ERRs are orphan nuclear receptors and key regulators of energy metabolism by orchestrating mitochondrial biogenesis , fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) and oxidative phosphorylation . Here , we show that ERRs also stimulate glycolysis under normoxia . ERRs directly bind to and activate promoters of many genes encoding glycolytic enzymes , and the ERR-binding sites in such promoters are essential for ERR-mediated transcriptional activation . ERRs interact with Myc , and the two factors synergistically activate transcription of glycolytic genes . Furthermore , overexpression of ERRs increases glycolytic gene expression and lactate production . Conversely , depletion of ERRs in cancer cells reduces expression of glycolytic genes and glucose uptake , resulting in decreased aerobic glycolysis and cell growth . Taken together , these results suggest that ERRs are important transcriptional activators of the glycolytic pathway and contribute to the Warburg effect in cancer cells .
Both the deregulation of microRNAs and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) are emerging as important factors in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Here , miR-133b was found to be associated with tumor stage , the extent of regional lymph node involvement , stage , visceral pleura or vessel invasion and EGFR mRNA expression in Chinese patients with NSCLC . Bioinformatic analysis and luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-133b can interact specifically with the 3'-UTR of EGFR mRNA . Functionally , miR-133b transfection showed regulatory activity in translationally repressing EGFR mRNA . Moreover , miR-133b transfection may modulate apoptosis , invasion and sensitivity to EGFR-TKI through the EGFR signaling pathways , especially in EGFR-addicted NSCLC cells . Taken together , our findings show that miR-133b can inhibit cell growth of NSCLC through targeting EGFR and regulating its downstream signaling pathway . This finding has important implications for the development of targeted therapeutics for a number of EGFR-addicted cancers .
In lung cancer , platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRalpha ) is expressed frequently by tumor-associated stromal cells and by cancer cells in a subset of tumors . We sought to determine the effect of targeting stromal PDGFRalpha in preclinical lung tumor xenograft models ( human tumor , mouse stroma ) . Effects of anti-human ( IMC-3G3 ) and anti-mouse ( 1E10 ) PDGFRalpha monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) on proliferation and PDGFRalpha signaling were evaluated in lung cancer cell lines and mouse fibroblasts . Therapy studies were conducted using established PDGFRalpha-positive H1703 cells and PDGFRalpha-negative Calu-6 , H1993 , and A549 subcutaneous tumors in immunocompromised mice treated with vehicle , anti-PDGFRalpha mAbs , chemotherapy , or combination therapy . Tumors were analyzed for growth and levels of growth factors . IMC-3G3 inhibited PDGFRalpha activation and the growth of H1703 cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo , but had no effect on PDGFRalpha-negative cell lines or mouse fibroblasts. 1E10 inhibited growth and PDGFRalpha activation of mouse fibroblasts , but had no effect on human cancer cell lines in vitro . In vivo , 1E10-targeted inhibition of murine PDGFRalpha reduced tumor growth as single-agent therapy in Calu-6 cells and enhanced the effect of chemotherapy in xenografts derived from A549 cells . We also identified that low expression cancer cell expression of VEGF-A and elevated expression of PDGF-AA were associated with response to stromal PDGFRalpha targeting . We conclude that stromal PDGFRalpha inhibition represents a means for enhancing control of lung cancer growth in some cases , independent of tumor cell PDGFRalpha expression .
We show that sufficient concentrations of gold nanoparticles produced by an original synthesis method in EMT-6 and CT-26 cancer cells make it possible to detect the presence , necrosis and proliferation of such cells after inoculation in live mice . We first demonstrated that the nanoparticles do not interfere with the proliferation process . Then , we observed significant differences in the tumor evolution and the angiogenesis process after shallow and deep inoculation . A direct comparison with pathology optical images illustrates the effectiveness of this approach .
Senescence , an inherent tumor suppressive mechanism , is a critical determinant for chemotherapy . In the present study , we show that the monocarboxylate transporter 2 ( MCT2 ) protein was tumor-selectively expressed in human colorectal malignancies and knockdown of MCT2 induces mitochondrial dysfunction , cell-cycle arrest , and senescence without additional cellular stress in colorectal cancer cell lines . Moreover , the reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) scavenger , N-acetylcysteine , blocked MCT2 knockdown-induced growth arrest and cellular senescence , indicating a pivotal role of ROS in this pathway . Dramatic induction of mitochondrial superoxide generation and decrease in ATP production was observed , indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction is the major mechanism underlying MCT2 knockdown-induced ROS generation . Senescence-associated DNA damage was also evident from the increase in promyelocytic leukemia bodies , gammaH2AX foci , and SAHF . Conversely , overexpression of MCT2 prevented doxorubicin-induced ROS accumulation ( P = 0.0002 ) and cell growth inhibition ( P = 0.001 ) . MCT2 knockdown suppressed KRAS mutant colorectal tumor growth in vivo . In addition , MCT2 knockdown and cytostatic drug combination further enhanced the antitumor effect . These findings support the use of MCT2 as a promising target for inhibition of colorectal cancer .
The aim of this work was to characterize the antitumoral activity of the plant compound 7-epi-nemorosone in prostate carcinoma cell lines . Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second-leading cause of cancer death in men . In spite of the current therapeutic options for this cancer entity , many patients die due to metastases in distant organs and acquired chemotherapy resistance . Thus , approaches to provide improvements in outcome and quality of life for such patients are urgently needed . Recently , the polyisoprenylated benzophenone 7-epi-nemorosone , originally collected by honeybees from Clusia rosea and Clusia grandiflora ( Clusiaceae ) , has been described to be a potent antitumoral agent . Here , its activity in prostate carcinoma is reported. 7-epi-nemorosone was isolated from Caribbean propolis employing RP-HPLC techniques . Its cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTT proliferation assay in human androgen-dependent prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells including an MDR1(+) sub-line . No cross-resistance was detected . FACS-based cell cycle analysis revealed a significant increase in the sub-G0/G1 , G1 , and depletion in the S phase populations . A concomitant down-regulation of cyclins D1/D3 and CDK 4/6 in LNCaP cells was detected by Western blot . Annexin-V-FITC labeling and caspase-3 cleavage assays showed that 7-epi-nemorosone induced apoptotic events . Major signal transduction elements such as p38 MAPK and Akt/PKB as well as androgen receptor AR and PSA production were found to be down-regulated after exposure to the drug . ERK1/2 protein levels and phosphorylation status were down-regulated accompanied by up-regulation but inhibition of the activity of their immediate upstream kinases MEK1/2 . Additionally , Akt/PKB enzymatic activity was effectively inhibited at a similar concentration as for MEK1/2 . Here , we demonstrate for the first time that 7-epi-nemorosone exerts cytotoxicity in an androgen-dependent prostate carcinoma entity by targeting the MEK1/2 signal transducer .
Proline- , glutamic acid- and leucine-rich protein-1/modulator of non-genomic activity of estrogen receptor ( ER ) ( PELP1/MNAR ) is a novel nuclear receptor ( NR ) co-activator that plays an essential role in the actions of ER . Emerging findings suggest that PELP1/MNAR is a novel proto-oncogene , whose expression is deregulated in several hormone-responsive cancers , including endometrial cancer . In this study , we demonstrate that PELP1/MNAR is widely expressed in endometrial carcinoma cell lines . To investigate its possible role in endometrial carcinoma progression , we adopted an RNA interference technology to downregulate PELP1/MNAR expression in Ishikawa endometrial carcinoma cells . PELP1/MNAR downregulation substantially reduced cell proliferation , and the cells in which PELP1/MNAR expression was knocked down also exhibited a decreased migration and invasion ability , as shown by Boyden chamber and invasion assays . The results showed that the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was also decreased . These results suggest that PELP1/MNAR plays a role in endometrial cancer progression and metastasis , and that PELP1/MNAR may be a potential therapeutic target for endometrial cancer .
BACKGROUND Growth Regulation by Estrogen in Breast cancer ( GREB1 ) was an estrogen receptor ( ER ) target gene , and GREB1 expression inversely correlated with HER2 status , possibly as a surrogate marker for ER status and a predictor for tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer patients . In the present study , we examine the function and regulation of GREB1 in breast cancer , with the goal to develop GREB1 as a biomarker in breast cancer with de novo and acquired tamoxifen resistance . METHODS We overexpressed GREB1 using adenovirus containing the full length GREB1 cDNA ( Ad-GREB1 ) in breast cancer cell lines . The soft agar assay was used as a measure of anchorage independent growth . The effects of GREB1 on cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells transduced with Ad-GREB1 were also measured by the me olic activity using AlamarBlue assay . We tested whether there was interaction between STAT3 and ER , which could repress GREB1 expression by immunoprecipitation assay . The effects of IL-6/JAK/STAT3 cascade activation on estrogen-induced GREB1 promoter activity were determined by luciferase assay and those on gene expression were measured by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) . RESULTS We found that the ability of breast cancer cells to grow in soft agar is enhanced following GREB1 transfection . In MCF-7 cells transduced with Ad-GREB1 or transfected with siRNA GREB1 , the metabolic activity was increased or completely abolished , suggesting that GREB1 may function as a growth promoter in breast cancer . E2 treatment increased GREB1 promoter luciferase activity . IL-6 inhibited E2-induced GREB1 transcription activity and GREB1 mRNA expression . Constitutively expressing active STAT3 construct ( STAT3-C ) dramatically decreased GREB1 transcription . CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that overexpression of GREB1 promotes cell proliferation and increases the clonogenic ability in breast cancer cells . Moreover , Il6/STAT3 modulates estrogen-induced GREB1 transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells .
Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 plays a role in insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF1 ) signaling ( integrin-IGF1 receptor ( IGF1R ) cross-talk ) in non-transformed cells in anchorage-dependent conditions . We reported previously that IGF1 directly binds to \u03b1v\u03b23 and induces \u03b1v\u03b23-IGF1-IGF1R ternary complex formation in these conditions . The integrin-binding defective IGF1 mutant ( R36E/R37E ) is defective in inducing ternary complex formation and IGF signaling , whereas it still binds to IGF1R . We studied if IGF1 can induce signaling in anchorage-independent conditions in transformed Chinese hamster ovary cells that express \u03b1v\u03b23 ( \u03b23-CHO ) cells . Here we describe that IGF1 signals were more clearly detectable in anchorage-independent conditions ( polyHEMA-coated plates ) than in anchorage-dependent conditions . This suggests that IGF signaling is masked by signals from cell-matrix interaction in anchorage-dependent conditions . IGF signaling required \u03b1v\u03b23 expression , and R36E/R37E was defective in inducing signals in polyHEMA-coated plates . These results suggest that \u03b1v\u03b23-IGF1 interaction , not \u03b1v\u03b23-extracellular matrix interaction , is essential for IGF signaling . Inhibitors of IGF1R , Src , AKT , and ERK1/2 did not suppress \u03b1v\u03b23-IGF-IGF1R ternary complex formation , suggesting that activation of these kinases are not required for ternary complex formation . Also , mutations of the \u03b23 cytoplasmic tail ( Y747F and Y759F ) that block \u03b23 tyrosine phosphorylation did not affect IGF1R phosphorylation or AKT activation . We propose a model in which IGF1 binding to IGF1R induces recruitment of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 to the IGF-IGF1R complex and then \u03b23 and IGF1R are phosphorylated . It is likely that \u03b1v\u03b23 should be together with the IGF1-IGF1R complex for triggering IGF signaling .
The prediction of response or severe toxicity and therapy individualisation are extremely important in cancer chemotherapy . There are few tools to predict chemoresponse or toxicity in cancer patients . We investigated the correlation between the induction and repair of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) using constant-field gel electrophoresis ( CFGE ) and evaluating cell cycle progression and the sensitivity of four cancer cell lines to 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) . Using a sulphorhodamine-B assay , colon carcinoma cells ( HCT116 ) were found to be the most sensitive to 5FU , followed by liver carcinoma cells ( HepG2 ) and breast carcinoma cells ( MCF-7 ) . Cervical carcinoma cells ( HeLa ) were the most resistant . As measured by CFGE , DSB induction , but not residual DSBs , exhibited a significant correlation with the sensitivity of the cell lines to 5FU . Flow cytometric cell cycle analysis revealed that 14% of HCT116 or HepG2 cells and 2% of MCF-7 cells shifted to sub-G1 phase after a 96-h incubation with 5FU . Another 5FU-induced cell cycle change in HCT116 , HepG2 and MCF-7 cells was the mild arrest of cells in G1 and/or G2/M phases of the cell cycle . In addition , 5FU treatment resulted in the accumulation of HeLa cells in the S and G2/M phases . Determination of Fas ligand ( Fas-L ) and caspase 9 as representative markers for the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis , respectively , revealed that 5FU-induced apoptosis in HCT116 and HepG2 results from the expression of Fas-L ( extrinsic pathway ) . Therefore , the induction of DNA DSBs by 5FU , detected using CFGE , and the induction of apoptosis are candidate predictive markers that may distinguish cancer cells which are likely to benefit from 5FU treatment and the measurement of DSBs using CFGE may aid the prediction of clinical outcome .
Jaceosidin , a flavonoid derived from Artemisia princeps ( Japanese mugwort ) , has been shown to inhibit the growth of several human cancer cells , However , the exact mechanism for the cytotoxic effect of jaceosidin is not completely understood . In this study , we investigated the molecular mechanism involved in the antiproliferative effect of jaceosidin in human endometrial cancer cells . We demonstrated that jaceosidin is a more potent inhibitor of cell growth than cisplatin in human endometrial cancer cells . In contrast , jaceosidin-induced cytotoxicity in normal endometrial cells was lower than that observed for cisplatin . Jaceosidin induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and modulated the levels of cyclin B and p-Cdc2 in Hec1A cells . Knockdown of p21 using specific siRNAs partially abrogated jaceosidin-induced cell growth inhibition . Additional mechanistic studies revealed that jaceosidin treatment resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of Cdc25C and ATM-Chk1/2 . Ku55933 , an ATM inhibitor , reversed jaceosidin-induced cell growth inhibition , in part . Moreover , jaceosidin treatment resulted in phosphorylation of ERK , and pretreatment with the ERK inhibitor , PD98059 , attenuated cell growth inhibition by jaceosidin . These data suggest that jaceosidin , isolated from Japanese mugwort , modulates the ERK/ATM/Chk1/2 pathway , leading to inactivation of the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex , followed by G2/M cell cycle arrest in endometrial cancer cells .
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) , a subgroup of ligand-activated nuclear receptors , plays critical roles in cell cycle regulation , differentiation , apoptosis and invasion . PPARgamma is involved in tumorigenesis and is a potent target for cancer therapy . PPARgamma transactivation of KLF4 has been demonstrated in various studies ; however , how PPARgamma regulates KLF4 expression is not clear . In this study , we revealed that PPARgamma regulates the expression of KLF4 by binding directly to the PPAR response element ( PPRE ) within the KLF4 promoter . The PPRE resided at -1657bp to -1669bp upstream of the KLF4 ATG codon , which is essential for the transactivation of TGZ-induced KLF4 expression . Furthermore , we found that stable silencing of KLF4 obviously suppressed the G1/S arrest and anti-proliferation effects induced by PPARgamma ligands . Taken together , our data indicated that upregulating KLF4 upon PPARgamma activation is mediated through PPRE in KLF4 promoter , thus providing further insights into PPARgamma signal transduction pathway as well as a novel cancer therapeutic strategy .
The aberrant expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( HER-2 ) has been detected in ovarian cancer . However , the role of HER-2 in the development of ovarian cancer has not been sufficiently elucidated . The objective of this study was to determine the role of HER-2 in the apoptosis and metastasis of SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells . SKOV-3 cells were transfected with three double-stranded small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) molecules that target HER-2 . Various sequences were synthesized by T7 transcription invitro to select the most effective HER-2-silencing siRNA . SKOV-3 cells were examined for growth inhibition using the MTT proliferation assay and apoptosis was assessed using flow cytometry and TUNEL assay . The Matrigel basement memebrane matrix was used to assess invasion and chemotactic mobility , as a model of tumor cell metastasis . Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of matrix metallopeptidase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , E-cadherin , N-cadherin and vimentin. siRNA interference in HER-2 resulted in decreased cell proliferation and invasion and increased apoptosis . Western blot analysis demonstrated a marked increase in E-cadherin and MMP-9 and a reduction in N-cadherin and vimentin protein levels in the SKOV-3 cells . The suppression of HER-2 expression resulted in apoptosis and the inhibition of metastasis of SKOV-3 cells . Therefore , the overexpression of the HER-2 gene can enhance the metastatic potential of SKOV-3 cells by increasing the protein levels of MMP-9 . Epithelial-mesenchymal transition may be involved in the HER-2 siRNA-induced invasion and migration of SKOV-3 cells . Taken together , these results suggest that HER-2 functions as an oncogene and may thus be an attractive therapeutic target in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells .
The aim of this study was to determine whether isorhamnetin , an immediate 3'-O-methylated metabolite of quercetin , affects proliferation , cell death , and the cell cycle of human colon carcinoma ( HCT-116 ) cells . Isorhamnetin was found to be a potent antiproliferative agent in a dose- and time-dependent manner , with an IC50 of 72 muM after 48 h of incubation as estimated by MTT assay . Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy analysis showed that isorhamnetin exerted a stimulatory effect on apoptosis and necrosis . Isorhamnetin also increased the number of cells in G2/M phase . Serum deprivation appeared to potentiate the effects of isorhamnetin on cell death and facilitated cell cycle progression to G0/G1 phase . These results suggest that isorhamnetin might mediate inhibition of HCT-116 cell growth through the perturbation of cell cycle progression and are consistent with the notion that G2/M checkpoints could be a conserved target for flavonoids in human colon cancer cells , leading to apoptotic and necrotic death . These antiproliferative , apoptotic , necrotic , and cell cycle effects suggest that isorhamnetin may have clinically significant therapeutic and chemopreventive capabilities . To our knowledge , this is the first report of the effect of isorhamnetin on human colon cancer cells .
RKIP-1 is a metastasis suppressor that is frequently downregulated in aggressive cancers . However , the consequences of RKIP loss in primary or immortalized cells have not yet been explored . Using HEK-293 RKIP depleted ( termed HEK-499 ) and Flp-In T-Rex-293 RKIP inducible cell lines combined with whole transcriptome analysis , we show that RKIP-1 silencing accelerates DNA synthesis and G1/S transition entry by inducing the expression of cdc6 , MCM 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 , cdc45L , cyclin D2 , cyclin E2 , cyclin D1 , SKP2 and the downregulation of p21(cip1) . Moreover , RKIP depletion accelerates the time from nuclear envelop breakdown ( NEB ) to anaphase markedly , while the upregulation of RKIP shortened the NEB to anaphase time . We show that RKIP depletion induces the expression of NEK6 , a molecule known to enhance G2/M transition , and down-regulates G2/M checkpoint molecules like Aurora B , cyclin G1 and sertuin that slow the G2/M transition time . These subtle changes in the kinetics of the cell cycle culminate in a higher proliferation rate of HEK-499 compared to control cells . Finally , we show that RKIP depletion enhances cellular motility by inducing the expression/stabilization of beta-catenin , vimentin , MET and PAK1 . Overall , our data suggest that modulation of the cell cycle checkpoints and motility by RKIP may be fundamental to its metastasis suppressive function in cancer and that RKIP role in a cell is more intricate and diverse than previously thought .
