Induction of the expression of the Mr 67,000 high-affinity laminin receptor gene has been postulated as playing a role in the progression of human tumors to invasive cancers . We tested this hypothesis by examining histopathological sections of a large number of epithelial lesions of the genital tract associated with human papillomaviruses . In situ hybridization was performed with a riboprobe generated from a laminin receptor complementary DNA . Laminin receptor mRNA was expressed primarily in the less differentiated cells in normal squamous tissues and in a spectrum of squamous neoplasms . There was no net induction of mRNA per cell in intraepithelial or invasive squamous neoplasms relative to normal tissue . In contrast , laminin receptor mRNA was not expressed at a detectable level in normal glands of the uterine cervix but was dramatically induced in morphologically abnormal , human papillomavirus-positive glands , irrespective of the genotype of human papillomaviruses present . The induction occurred before any evidence of invasion , and there was no further increase during the transition from adenocarcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma . We conclude that induction of high-affinity laminin receptor gene expression is associated with the development of malignancies of cervical glandular epithelia , but the increased expression appears to correlate with the proliferative rather than the invasive properties of these cells .
5-HT1c receptors have been shown to act as protooncogenes in NIH 3T3 cells , inducing ligand-dependent focus formation . In order to assess their mitogenic and oncogenic potential in a different cell system , we transfected these receptors into CCL39 hamster fibroblasts , a well-characterized growth factor-dependent cell line . Cell clones expressing functional receptors were isolated and tested for ( a ) growth factor dependence of proliferation measuring thymidine incorporation in response to varying doses of serum , ( b ) the response to serotonin alone or in combination with other growth factors , and ( c ) the capacity for anchorage-independent proliferation . In the absence or presence of serotonin , the large majority of the clones isolated showed normal morphology and normal growth factor dependence and was unable to grow in soft agar . None of the clones showed a significant response to serotonin alone in DNA synthesis reinitiation experiments , but synergy was observed between serotonin and the tyrosine kinase activating growth factors EGF and FGF . However , the major part of this effect could be abolished by an antagonist of 5-HT1b receptors , which are endogenous in CCL39 cells . The same receptor was found to mediate a significant mitogenic response to the neurotransmitter in Ha-ras-transfected cells . The fact that 5-HT1c receptors do not readily induce a transformed phenotype in CCL39 cells clearly distinguishes them from strong dominantly acting oncogene products like RAS , SRC , or FMS .
c-myc , c-erbB-2 , and Ki-67 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 11 normal breast tissues and 42 invasive and 14 noninvasive breast carcinomas . The c-myc product was detected in all breast carcinoma specimens and in 7 of 11 normal breast tissues . Invasive tumors stained more frequently with the anti-myc monoclonal antibody than did noninvasive tumors , while the level of expression in normal breast tissue was much less than that in breast cancer . Membrane staining of the c-erbB-2 protein was demonstrated in 29% ( 4 of 14 ) of noninvasive ductal carcinomas and in 45% ( 19 of 42 ) of invasive breast carcinomas . None of the 11 normal breast tissue samples was positive . The mean value of Ki-67-positive cells was 0.91 +/- 0.31% for normal breast tissue , 4.57 +/- 1.36% for noninvasive ductal carcinoma , and 12.76 +/- 2.18% for invasive breast cancer . In 42 invasive breast carcinomas , the expression of c-myc , c-erbB-2 , and Ki-67 proliferation marker were compared with lymph node status , estrogen receptor status , progesterone receptor status , and age of patients at diagnosis. c-erbB-2 overexpression and Ki-67 overexpression were identified as the only factors associated with lymph node status . We concluded that they might be additional prognostic factors for breast carcinoma .
A number of growth factors have been implicated in the control of the proliferation of breast cancer cells and some have been reported to mediate the proliferative effects of oestradiol . MCF-7 cells were treated with growth factors in the presence and absence of oestradiol . Oestradiol increased the response of cells to the proliferative effects of epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , transforming growth factor alpha ( TGF-alpha ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) . Platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ) and cathepsin D had no effect in the presence or absence of oestradiol while TGF-beta slightly reduced the stimulation by oestradiol . In the absence of oestradiol , there was little effect of combinations of growth factors although the effects of bFGF and IGF-I were additive . In the presence of oestradiol , the effects of bFGF and TGF-alpha were additive whereas bFGF acted as an IGF-I antagonist . Overall , bFGF had the greatest effect on cell proliferation although this was less marked than the previously described effect of the IGFs and insulin . The effects of oestradiol on the sensitivity of cells to the proliferative effects of bFGF did not appear to result from regulation of bFGF receptor expression .
Using monolayer cultures of clonally isolated C3 and T5 rat prostate cancer cells , we determined that acidic ( aFGF ) and basic ( bFGF ) fibroblast growth factors profoundly enhanced T5 cell thymidine incorporation with half-maximum stimulation at 0.53 and 0.35 ng/ml , respectively . In contrast , aFGF or bFGF enhancement of C3 cell thymidine incorporation was about 5% of that of T5 cells , and effects were principally mitogen concentration independent . Saturation analyses and cross-linking studies established that both C3 and T5 cells contained high-affinity FGF receptors of 120 and 145 kilodaltons and that receptor content and Kd of C3 and T5 cells were comparable. aFGF or bFGF stimulation of T5 cell thymidine incorporation profoundly decreased as cell plating density was reduced from 1.5 x 10(5) to 1.0 x 10(4) cells/well . The modest response of C3 cells to either aFGF or bFGF also decreased as cell plating density was reduced . Because heparin preserves FGF biological activity and enhances bFGF binding to high-affinity FGF receptors , we examined the effect of heparin on FGF stimulation of C3 cell thymidine incorporation . We found that changes in cell plating density and/or medium heparin concentration had variable , inconsistent effects . These were C3 cell plating density associated and included inhibition or modest enhancement of FGF effects . Binding analyses established that high-affinity bFGF binding of C3 and T5 cells immediately prior to assessing FGF-stimulated thymidine incorporation was comparable and independent of cell plating density , implying that C3 cell FGF insensitivity was not attributable to differences in C3 and T5 cell FGF receptor content at the time of mitogen stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Many breast cancers are estrogen independent , and even in patients who initially respond to estrogen suppression therapy , the regression is often temporary . We have recently shown that antagonists of bombesin and gastrin-releasing peptide , including RC-3095 , inhibit the growth of pancreatic , colonic , and prostatic cancers in experimental animals . This effect was associated with a substantial decrease in epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor levels in pancreatic and colon cancers .
PRL induces quiescent Nb2 rat T-lymphoma cells to undergo mitogenesis . Upon PRL stimulation , the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) is induced as a novel T-cell activation gene in Nb2 cells . Surprisingly , IRF-1 is expressed twice during a single PRL-induced growth cycle : first during the early G1 phase , in an immediate transient peak from 15 min to 2 h , and second during the G1/S phase transition , in a broader peak beginning at 8 h . The unusual biphasic expression of IRF-1 mRNA is accompanied both times by de novo IRF-1 protein synthesis . However , the rate of IRF-1 protein turnover appears to be different in G1 and S phases . IRF-1 protein expressed in G1 exhibits a half-life of about 25 min , whereas in the S phase , the half-life is about 60 min . By washing out PRL at various times during G1 , we found a direct correlation among the length of PRL exposure , the second peak of IRF-1 mRNA expression , and DNA synthesis . Our data suggest that PRL and one putative nuclear mediator , IRF-1 , may be important in two distinct phases of the cell cycle : first in cell cycle activation , and then in S phase progression .
BACKGROUND Ovarian surface epithelial cells undergo several rounds of division to repair the wound created by follicular rupture at the time of ovulation . This cyclical requirement for cell division , when not interrupted by the long anovulatory rest periods that occur during pregnancy and lactation , may contribute to the development of ovarian cancer . PURPOSE AND METHODS To test this hypothesis , we isolated rat ovarian surface epithelial cells from 10 adult female Fisher rats , initiated two mixed-population and seven clonal cell lines , and repeatedly subcultured these cells in vitro for more than 20 passages . We then tested them for the acquisition of the following four features associated with transformation : 1 ) the loss of contact inhibition , 2 ) the capacity for substrate-independent growth , 3 ) the ability to form tumors when injected subcutaneously and/or intraperitoneally into athymic mice , and 4 ) cytogenetic abnormalities . RESULTS Loss of contact inhibition was observed in all nine late-passage cell lines . Six of the nine late-passage , but none of the early-passage , cell lines tested exhibited a capacity for substrate-independent growth that was augmented in a dose-dependent manner by epidermal growth factor . Two late-passage cell lines ( clone 2 and mixed-population 2 ) generated tumors in athymic BALB/c mice within 3 weeks following subcutaneous injection of 5 x 10(6) cells , whereas similar numbers of early-passage cells from the same cell lines failed to generate palpable tumors . Late-passage clone 7 cells were tumorigenic when 5 x 10(7) cells were injected intraperitoneally . Two of the cell lines analyzed exhibited alterations involving losses of part or all of one member of the chromosome 5 pair . Clone 2 possessed an interstitial deletion , del(5)(q21.3q24) , consistent with the loss of an uncloned putative tumor suppressor gene at 5q22q23 previously reported to reside near the loci for the interferon alpha , interferon beta , and c-jun genes . Early-passage clone 7 cells exhibited chromosome 5 monosomy , while late-passage cells contained one normal chromosome 5 and a derivative ( 5q12q ) . Southern analysis of the three cell lines revealed no consistent loss of loci for the interferon and c-jun genes , although early-passage clone 7 cells had one half the gene copy number for the interferon beta and c-jun genes and both early- and late-passage clone 7 cells lacked DNA sequences hybridizing with the probe for interferon alpha . CONCLUSION This pattern of passage-dependent spontaneous transformation of rat ovarian surface epithelial cells in vitro supports the hypothesis that repetitious ovulation contributes to the etiology of human ovarian cancer .
We assayed the estrogen and progesterone cytosolic receptors by using the enzyme immunoassay method , the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) cell surface receptors by using 125I-labeled hormone , and the levels of polyamines ( putrescine , spermine , and spermidine ) by using a high-pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) procedure in neoplastic and surrounding normal tissues of patients with colorectal cancer . Our findings show that mean polyamine levels in neoplastic tissue were approximately two-fold greater than the levels in normal colonic mucosa . Estrogen and progesterone receptorial content in normal mucosa were twofold greater than those in neoplastic tissue . No significant differences in EGF receptors were found between colonic cancer tissue and the surrounding normal tissues . The correlations we found between 1 ) estrogen and polyamine levels and 2 ) estrogen and EGF binding suggest the existence of a modulation of the estrogens on colonic mucosa cell proliferation . Furthermore , there was no significant dependency of polyamine and receptor concentrations from the tumor site , the histologic differentiation , or the age and sex of patients .
Findings of increased numbers of epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGF-R ) and increased expression of transforming growth factor alpha ( TGF-alpha ) in surgical specimens of human renal cell carcinoma have led to the proposal that growth of these tumors may be regulated by TGF-alpha in an autocrine manner . In the studies presented here , we have examined this hypothesis using two human renal carcinoma cell lines , SKRC-4 and SKRC-29 . We demonstrated that both SKRC-4 and SKRC-29 cells were growth stimulated by greater than 35% when cultured in the presence of TGF-alpha or EGF and were inhibited by 29% to 46% if cultured in the presence of anti-EGF-R monoclonal antibody 225 . Treatment of cells with TGF-alpha enhanced the levels of expression of EGF-R mRNA and TGF-alpha mRNA . In addition , incubation of cells with monoclonal antibody 225 significantly elevated the levels of excreted TGF-alpha species in the culture medium . Our findings suggest that proliferation of human renal carcinoma cells may be regulated by endogenously produced TGF-alpha and that this regulatory pathway can be interrupted using antibody to its receptor , EGF-R .
Tricyclic antidepressants , such as amitriptyline ( Elavil ) , and the nontricyclic agent , fluoxetine ( Prozac ) , bind to growth-regulatory intracellular histamine receptors , associated with anti-estrogen binding sites in microsomes and nuclei . The prototype anti-estrogen binding site/intracellular histamine receptor ligand , N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]ethanamine HCl , inhibits normal cell proliferation in vitro but stimulates tumor growth in vivo . Because of their structural similarity to N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]ethanamine HCl , we carried out studies to determine whether amitriptyline and fluoxetine stimulate tumor growth and/or development in rodents at concentrations relevant to the treatment of human depression ( equivalent human dose range , approximately 100-150 mg/day for amitriptyline and approximately 20-80 mg/day for fluoxetine ) . All experiments were performed blinded . In studies of growth stimulation of transplantable syngeneic tumors , groups of mice were inoculated s.c. with C-3 fibrosarcoma cells or given i.v. or s.c. injections of B16f10 melanoma cells , followed 24 h later by daily i.p. injections of saline , amitriptyline , or fluoxetine . Tumor latency ( fibrosarcoma ) , aggregate tumor weight ( s.c. injected melanoma ) , or time to death from pulmonary metastasis ( i.v. injected melanoma ) was determined ; drug-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis in C-3 fibrosarcoma cells in vitro was correlated with tumor growth acceleration in vivo . In a mammary carcinogenesis model , the effects of chronic saline , amitriptyline , or fluoxetine administration on the rate and frequency of development of mammary tumors in rats fed dimethylbenzanthracene ( DMBA ) were compared . Eight of 20 amitriptyline- or fluoxetine-treated mice developed fibrosarcoma tumors by day 5 , as compared to none of 20 saline controls ( P less than 0.002 ) . Similarly , 20 of 21 DMBA-treated rats receiving the antidepressant drugs developed 33 mammary tumors by week 15 as compared to 5 tumors in 4 of 7 DMBA-treated rats receiving saline ( P less than 0.001 ) . For both models , tumor latency decreased 30-40% and , in the DMBA model , tumor frequency increased greater than 2-fold in the antidepressant-treated rats as compared to controls . Stimulation of fibrosarcoma growth in vivo correlated with a corresponding bell-shaped drug-induced increase in DNA synthesis in vitro . While the median time to death from pulmonary metastases did not differ among groups given i.v. injections of melanoma cells , a significant ( P less than 0.01 ) stimulation of growth of s.c. injected melanoma was observed in mice receiving the antidepressants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS )
Oncostatin M ( OSM ) , an interleukin-6 type cytokine , acts via the gp130 signaling receptor to inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation of breast cancer cells . EGF , a mitogen for breast cells , signals via EGFR/ErbB tyrosine kinase receptors which are implicated in breast cancer pathogenesis . Here we show paradoxically that EGF enhanced the OSM-induced inhibition of proliferation and induction of cellular differentiation in both estrogen receptor positive and negative breast cancer cells . This functional synergism was also seen with heregulin but not SCF , PDGF or IGF-1 , indicating that it was specific to EGF-related growth factors . Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that gp130 was constitutively associated with ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 . There was a similar association between the OSMRbeta and ErbB-2 . Furthermore , EGF unexpectedly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 . We show that OSM induced phosphorylation of STAT3 . Both OSM and EGF activated the p42/44 MAP kinases , but while the MEK inhibitor , PD98059 , ablated the OSM-induced inhibition , it only partially ablated the inhibitory effects of OSM plus EGF . Thus , we have demonstrated that the receptors and signalling pathways of two apparently unrelated growth factors were intimately linked , resulting in an unexpected biological effect . This provides a new mechanism for generating signalling diversity and has potential clinical implications in breast cancer .
Overexpression and amplification of cyclin D1 were investigated by immunohistochemistry and differential polymerase chain reaction ( dPCR ) in 440 formalin-fixed primary breast carcinoma tissues . Overexpression of cyclin D1 was detected in 60% ( 263/440 ) and amplification of cyclin D1 was noted in 27% ( 119/440 ) of the primary breast carcinomas . Molecular analysis demonstrated that cyclin D1 was amplified in 30% ( 7/23 ) of the comedo DCIS , 22% ( 9/41 ) of the comedo DCIS and 32% ( 13/41 ) of the adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas , 30% ( 82/270 ) of the invasive ductal carcinomas , 27% ( 9/33 ) of the invasive lobular carcinomas , 19% ( 4/21 ) of the colloid carcinomas and 13% ( 2/15 ) of the medullary carcinomas . Cyclin D1 was amplified in 11% ( 2/19 ) of the invasive ductal carcinomas but not in the adjacent non-comedo DCIS lesions . Our observation showed that cyclin D1 was strongly positive in 61% ( 14/23 ) of the comedo subtype , 61% ( 11/18 ) of the non-comedo subtype , 59% ( 24/41 ) of the comedo DCIS and 63% ( 26/41 ) of the adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas , 53% ( 10/19 ) of the non-comedo DCIS and 58% ( 11/19 ) of the adjacent invasive lesions , 58% ( 157/270 ) of the invasive ductal carcinomas , 73% ( 24/33 ) of the invasive lobular carcinomas , 52% ( 11/21 ) of the colloid carcinomas and 27% ( 4/15 ) of the medullary carcinomas . A significant association was observed between in situ components and adjacent invasive lesions for cyclin D1 expression ( p<0.05 ) and amplification ( p<0.05 ) . A significant relationship was noted between amplification of cyclin D1 and lymph node metastases ( p<0.05 ) but not with histological grade ( p>0.05 ) , estrogen receptor status ( p>0.05 ) and proliferation index ( Ki-67 and PCNA ) ( p>0.05 ) . However , overexpression of cyclin D1 was statistically associated with well differentiated tumors ( p<0.05 ) and estrogen receptor positivity ( p<0.05 ) . No relationship was seen with nodal status ( p>0.05 ) and proliferation index ( Ki-67 and PCNA ) ( p>0.05 ) . These observations suggest that tumors positive for cyclin D1 protein may have features of good prognosis but amplification of cyclin D1 gene could be an indicator of tumors with poor prognostic features . Although majority of the Malaysian patients belong to younger age group ( <50 years old ) , amplification and expression of cyclin D1 was not statistically associated with patient age ( p>0.05 ) . These observations indicate that amplification and up-regulation of cyclin D1 may be independent of patient age . Moreover , overexpression and amplification of cyclin D1 in preinvasive , preinvasive and adjacent invasive lesions , and invasive carcinomas suggest that the gene may play an important role in early and late stages of breast carcinogenesis .
PURPOSE We recently reported that overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) positively correlated with radioresistance of murine carcinomas . Because cyclin D1 is a downstream sensor of EGFR activation , the present study investigated whether a relationship exists between the extent of cyclin D1 expression and in vivo radiocurability of murine tumors . We further investigated the influence of radiation on cyclin D1 expression and the expression of p27 , an inhibitor of the cyclin D1 downstream pathway , as well as the relationship of these molecular determinants to cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in tumors exposed to radiation . METHODS AND MATERIALS Cyclin D1 expression was assayed in nine carcinomas syngeneic to C3Hf/Kam mice using Western blot analysis . These tumors greatly differed in their radioresponse as assessed by TCD(50) . The expression of cyclin D1 and p27 proteins was determined by Western blotting . Cell proliferative activity in tumors was determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) immunochemistry . The effect of irradiation on the expression of cyclin D1 or p27 proteins and on PCNA positivity was determined in the radiosensitive OCa-I and in the radioresistant SCC-VII tumors . RESULTS Cyclin D1 expression varied among tumors by 40-fold , and its magnitude positively correlated with poorer tumor radioresponse ( higher TCD(50) values ) . The level of cyclin D1 expression paralleled that of EGFR . A 15-Gy dose reduced constitutive expression of cyclin D1 in the radiosensitive OCa-I tumors , but had no influence on expression of cyclin D1 in the radioresistant SCC-VII tumors . In contrast , 15 Gy increased the expression of p27 in radiosensitive tumors and reduced it in radioresistant tumors . Radiation induced no significant apoptosis or change in the percentage of PCNA-positive ( proliferating ) cells in SCC-VII tumors with high cyclin D1 levels , but it induced significant apoptosis and a decrease in the percentage of proliferating cells in OCa-I tumors with low cyclin D1 expression . CONCLUSION Our findings show a positive correlation between cyclin D1 expression and tumor radioresistance . The expression of cyclin D1 and p27 was modified by radiation and was associated with cellular response to radiation , but this depended on the pretreatment level of cyclin D1 expression . These findings may have important clinical implications : The pretreatment assessment of cyclin D1 expression could serve as a useful predictor of radiotherapy outcome and assist in selecting an effective treatment modality .
Notch signaling controls cell fate decisions of hematopoietic progenitors by inhibiting certain steps of differentiation and inducing either self-renewal or differentiation toward lymphoid or myeloid lineages . In addition , truncated Notch1 alleles could be associated with 10% of all cases of human T lymphoblastic leukemia and , when introduced into mouse bone marrow stem cells , cause T-cell neoplasms . However , functional links between the abundant expression of intact Notch1 and oncogenesis are still lacking . Here we show that Notch1 is highly expressed in B- and T-cell-derived tumor cells of Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma . We demonstrate a novel mechanism for the oncogenic capacity of Notch1 by showing that the interaction between intact Notch1 on tumor cells and its ligand Jagged1 dramatically induces proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis in vitro . We further provide evidence that in Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma , Jagged1 is expressed in malignant and in bystander cells colocalizing with Notch1-positive tumor cells . Notch1 signaling may therefore be activated in tumor cells by Jagged1 through homotypic or heterotypic cell-cell interactions , and it seems likely that these interactions contribute to lymphomagenesis in vivo . Thus , our data suggest that activated Notch1 signaling plays an important role in the pathobiology of Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma and that it might be a potential new target for treatment .
Prostate cancer ( PCA ) is the most common histological malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among North American men . There has been considerable interest in the chemopreventative properties of selenium . In this study , we assessed whether selenium inhibits cell growth and associated cell cycle regulatory proteins . Human PCA cells ( LNCaP , PC3 , PC3-AR2 , and PC3-M ) were incubated with and without selenium ( Seleno-DL-methionine , 150 microM ) for 24 , 48 , and 72 h . Cells were fixed and stained with propidium iodide for flow cytometry analysis . In parallel experiments , total protein was extracted , immunoprecipitated with cyclin E antibody , and analyzed by Western blot for the expression of cell cycle markers . Treatment with selenium caused G1 arrest and an 80% reduction in the S phase of LNCaP with no effect on PC3 . However , PC3 cells transfected with the androgen receptor ( PC3-AR2 ) exhibited a G2/M arrest and a marked reduction ( 57% ) in the S phase during cell cycle progression . In the analysis of cell cycle regulatory molecules , selenium-treated cells demonstrated a significant induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27 . These data suggest that selenium possesses strong antiproliferative properties in regard to human PCA . This effect appears to be dependent on the presence of a functioning androgen receptor . This provides a theoretical basis for Phase III studies of selenium in PCA prevention .
In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which tumour-specific CD4+ T-cell responses are impaired during tumour development , an attempt was made to identify factors which impair CD4+ T-cell responses at a late tumour-bearing stage . Plasma from mice bearing B16 melanoma for 30 days ( plasma d30 ) showed a more profound immunosuppressive effect on the in vitro proliferation of unrelated antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the presence of both antigen and antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) than plasma from na<FFFD>ve mice . The level of plasma transforming growth factor ( TGF)- was elevated in mice bearing B16 melanoma for 30 days compared with na<FFFD>ve mice , and the suppressive effect of plasma d30 was partially diminished by the neutralization of TGF- . Interestingly , immunoglobulin ( IgG)-bound TGF- , but not IgG-unbound TGF- , in plasma d30 was suggested to be responsible for the immunosuppressive activity . In addition , no suppressive effect of plasma d30 was observed when antigen was added as a class II peptide , thus suggesting that the impaired proliferation of CD4+ T cells in the presence of plasma d30 was due to a dysfunction of antigen uptake/processing by APC . Furthermore , dissociation between IgG and TGF- resulted in a loss of the suppressive activity of plasma d30 . Taken together , these results suggest that circulating IgG-bound TGF- is , at least in part , responsible for the impaired responses of CD4+ T cells at the late tumour-bearing stage by suppressing antigen uptake/ processing by APC .
Elevated insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1 ( IGFBP-rP1 ) mRNA in senescent human mammary epithelial cells suggested that the IGFBP-3 gene product may inhibit cell proliferation . To test this hypothesis , we used a retroviral vector to express IGFBP-rP1 cDNA in the IGFBP-rP1-deficient MCF-7 breast cancer cell line . Compared with control vector-transduced cells , cumulative cell numbers for IGFBP-rP1-transduced polyclonal or clonal cell cultures were reduced by 39 and 74% , respectively , after 1 week . Medium conditioned by IGFBP-rP1-producing cultures reduced cumulative cell numbers in parental MCF-7 cultures by 20% compared with medium from cultures of a control vector-transduced cell line . Nuclear fragmentation analysis and cell proliferation assays completed in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone excluded apoptosis as the responsible mechanism . The percentage of cells containing senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity was doubled compared with control cell cultures . Flow cytometry analysis indicated that twice as many noncycling cells were present in the IGFBP-rP1-transduced MCF-7 cell cultures compared with controls . These findings indicate that IGFBP-rP1 is an inhibitor of MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation and may act via a cellular senescence-like mechanism .
BACKGROUND Modulation of the expression of retinoic acid receptors ( RAR ) alpha and gamma in adult rat prostate by testosterone ( T ) suggests that RAR signaling events might mediate some of the androgen effects on prostate cells . METHOD In this study , we examined the interactions between T and retinoic acid ( RA ) in cell growth of human prostate carcinoma cells , LNCaP , and their relationship with the expression of RAR and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGF-R ) . RESULTS Both T and RA , when administered alone , stimulated 3H-thymidine incorporation in LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner ; the effect of each agent was reciprocally attenuated by the other agent . Testosterone treatment of LNCaP cells also resulted in dose dependent , biphasic increases in RAR alpha and gamma mRNAs ; increases paralleled that of 3H-thymidine incorporation and were attenuated by the presence of 100 nM RA . These results suggest a link between RAR signaling and the effect of T on LNCaP cell growth . Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the presence of putative androgen responsive element ( ARE ) in the promoter region of RAR alpha gene , suggesting that a direct AR-DNA interaction might mediate the effects of T on RAR alpha gene . Furthermore , treatment of LNCaP cells with 20 nM T resulted in an increase in EGF-R . In contrast , EGF-R was suppressed by 100 nM RA that also suppressed the effect of T. CONCLUSIONS Current results demonstrate interactions between T and RA in the expression of RARs and cell growth in LNCaP cells . The presence of putative ARE in the promoter of the RAR alpha gene suggests that AR-DNA interaction might mediate the effects of T on RAR alpha gene . The opposite effects of T and RA on the expression of RAR and EGF-R suggest that signal events of these receptors might be involved in the interaction between T and RA in the control of LNCaP cell growth .
We have modelled multiple stages of malignant transformation of human endothelial cells ( ECs ) by overexpressing the catalytic subunit of human telomerase ( hTERT ) , together with SV40 T antigen ( SV40T ) and oncogenic N-ras . Transfection with hTERT alone , led to the immortalization of two out of three cultures of bone marrow-derived ECs ( BMECs ) . One hTERT transduced BMEC culture underwent a long proliferative lag before resuming proliferation . BMECs transfected with hTERT alone were functionally and phenotypically normal . BMECs transfected with SV40T ( BMSVTs ) had an extended lifespan , but eventually succumbed to crisis . BMSVTs exhibited a partially transformed phenotype , demonstrating growth factor independence , altered antigen expression and forming tiny , infrequent colonies in vitro . Transduction of BMSVTs with hTERT resulted in immortalization of 4 out of 4 cultures . BMSVTs immortalized with hTERT formed large colonies in vitro and small transient tumours in vivo . BMECs co-expressing SV40T , hTERT and N-ras exhibited an overtly transformed phenotype ; forming very large colonies with an altered morphology and generating rapidly growing tumours in vivo . These investigations demonstrate transformation of human ECs to an overtly malignant phenotype . This model will be useful for understanding mechanisms underlying vascular and angiogenic neoplasias , as well as for testing drugs designed to curtail aberrant EC growth .
Dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , a well-known differentiation inducer in several myeloid cells , also induces a reversible G(1) arrest in many cell lines . We recently showed that DMSO induces a G(1) phase arrest in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells , by restoring contact inhibition and preventing high density-dependent apoptosis . CHO cells are frequently used in cell biology and mutagenesis studies due to their good growth capacity and ease of manipulation but are very difficult to synchronize by serum starvation since they detach from monolayers when they reach confluence . In this study we investigated the possibility of using DMSO to reversibly synchronize CHO cells in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle and analysed whether toxic effects follow the arrest using growth curve , sister chromatid exchange and micronuclei assays . We carried out a kinetic analysis of the arrest by DMSO and re-entry into the cell cycle after drug release by cytofluorimetric analysis of DNA content and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation . We show that CHO cells are efficiently and reversibly arrested in G(1) by DMSO in concentrations ranging between 1 and 2% . In our experiments , >90% of cells grown for 96 h in presence of the drug were arrested in G(1) and synchronously re-entered S phase approximately 8-12 h after release . Furthermore , expression levels of p27 were down-regulated during G(1) progression and cyclin D3 and E expression patterns were similar to those observed after serum starvation . No detectable cytotoxicity or genetic damage were induced in G(1) released cells as revealed by the tests employed . Our results show that DMSO is a very powerful inducer of G(1) synchronization in CHO cells without detectable cytotoxic or genetic effects in cell populations released from G(1) arrest . DMSO synchronization represents a model system in which to analyse protein activities regulating G(1) progression and investigate the response of G(1) cells to mutagen treatments .
PURPOSE To investigate treatment of human pancreatic cancer cell lines and xenografts with combinations of Erbitux ( IMC-C225 ) anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) antibody , gemcitabine , and radiation . METHODS AND MATERIALS BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 human pancreatic carcinoma cells were treated in vitro for 24 h with IMC-C225 ( 5 microg/mL ) , then exposed to epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) ( 10 mM ) for 5 min . Immunoblots were screened for EGFR expression and the ability of IMC-C225 to block EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR . Cells were treated with IMC-C225 ( 5 microg/mL ) on Day 0 , the IC(50) dose of gemcitabine on Day 1 for 24 h , followed by 3 Gy 60Co irradiation on Day 2 , or the combination of each agent . For cell proliferation , cells were counted on Day 4 , and for apoptosis , cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide , then analyzed by FACS . Cells were treated with the same single or multiple treatments and analyzed in a clonogenic cell survival assay . The effect of IMC-C225 , gemcitabine , and radiation on the growth of BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 tumor xenografts was determined . Athymic nude mice bearing established s.c. tumor xenografts of 6-8 mm diameter received 6 weeks of treatment with IMC-C225 ( 1 mg every 3 days x 6 ) alone or in combination with gemcitabine ( 120 mg/kg i.v. every 6 days x 6 ) , and 6 weekly fractions of 3 Gy radiation on the days after gemcitabine administration . Tumor growth was measured with Vernier calipers . RESULTS BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 cell lines expressed low levels of EGFR . IMC-C225 inhibited EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor on both cell lines . Treatment of cells with a combination of IMC-C225 + gemcitabine + radiation produced the highest induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation in vitro . Combination treatment with IMC-C225 , gemcitabine , and radiation produced 100% complete regression of MiaPaCa-2 tumors for more than 250 days , and the greatest growth inhibition of BxPC-3 tumors compared to any single or dual treatments . CONCLUSIONS The IMC-C225 therapy in combination with gemcitabine chemotherapy and radiation therapy demonstrated statistically significantly greater efficacy over the single and double combination therapies . This form of multimodality treatment shows potential clinical application in the treatment of pancreatic cancer in humans .
Peptide growth factors have been implicated in progression of prostate cancer ( PCa ) to the androgen-independent state ; however , much of the evidence linking diffusible mitogens and survival factors to this process remains circumstantial . Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) , a prostate stroma-derived factor , promotes survival , proliferation , and neuroendocrine differentiation of androgen-dependent LNCaP PCa cells in vitro . To test whether sustained exposure to HB-EGF can confer an androgen-independent phenotype , we generated stable populations of LNCaP cells that express constitutively a secreted form of HB-EGF ( LNCaP/sHB ) . LNCaP/sHB cells proliferated more rapidly under androgen-depleted conditions in vitro and formed larger tumors with higher frequency in intact and castrated severe combined immunodeficient mice , in comparison to control cells . LNCaP/sHB tumors also expressed higher levels of the neuroendocrine marker , neuron-specific enolase , compared with control tumors . In castrates , increased neuron-specific enolase expression in LNCaP/sHB tumors was associated with reduced androgen receptor ( AR ) levels . In vitro , AR protein levels were reduced in LNCaP/sHB cells , and in transient transfection assays using an androgen-responsive promoter ( mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat ) , LNCaP/sHB cells showed reduced sensitivity to dihydrotestosterone compared with controls . This is the first demonstration that continuous exposure of AR-positive PCa cells to a single growth factor can promote an androgen-independent phenotype in vivo . These findings also emphasize the potential role of pathways other than the AR axis in acquisition of androgen independence .
The thyroid hormone ( T3 ) blocks proliferation and induces differentiation of neuroblastoma N2a-beta cells that overexpress the beta 1 isoform of the T3 receptor . An element in the region responsible for premature termination of transcription mediates a rapid repression of c-myc gene expression by T3 . The hormone also causes a decrease of cyclin D1 gene transcription , and is able to antagonize the activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by Ras . In addition , a strong and sustained increase of the levels of the cyclin kinase inhibitor ( CKI ) p27(Kip1) are found in T3-treated cells . The increased levels of p27(Kip1) lead to a marked inhibition of the kinase activity of the cyclin-CDK2 complexes . As a consequence of these changes , retinoblastoma proteins are hypophosphorylated in T3-treated N2a-beta cells , and progression through the restriction point in the cell cycle is blocked .
Despite experimental evidence that sulforaphane can exert chemopreventive effects , whether these effects are specific for neoplastic cells is not known . Following our previous demonstration that sulforaphane induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human T lymphoblastoid Jurkat leukemia cells and increases p53 and bax protein expression , we tested sulforaphane on non-transformed phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes . Here , we demonstrate that sulforaphane arrested cell cycle progression in G , phase , through a decrease in the protein expression of cyclin D3 . Moreover , sulforaphane induced apoptosis ( and also necrosis ) , mediated by an increase in the expression of p53 . These findings suggest that sulforaphane is a growth modulator for T cells . Our in vitro evidence that sulforaphane is active and even cytotoxic in normal as well as transformed lymphocytes raises important questions regarding its suitability for cancer chemoprevention .
Epidemiological studies suggest that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) may influence breast cancer progression and prognosis . In order to study potential mechanisms of action of fatty acid modulation of tumor growth , we studied , in vitro , the influence of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on proliferation , cell cycle , differentiation and apoptosis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells . Both eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) inhibited the MCF-7 cell growth by 30% and 54% , respectively , while linoleic acid ( LA ) had no effect and arachidonic acid ( AA ) inhibited the cell growth by 30% ( p < 0.05 ) . The addition of vitamin E ( 10uM ) to cancer cells slightly restored cell growth . The incubation of MCF-7 cells with PUFAs did not alter the cell cycle parameters or induce cell apoptosis . However , the growth inhibitory effects of EPA , DHA and AA were associated with cell differentiation as indicated by positive Oil-Red-O staining of the cells . Lipid droplet accumulation was increased by 65% , 30% and 15% in the presence of DHA , EPA and AA , respectively ; ( p < 0.05 ) . These observations suggest that fatty acids may influence cellular processes at a molecular level , capable of modulating breast cancer cell growth .
Recent epidemiological and experimental investigations suggest a close relationship between cyclooxygenase ( COX ) and pathogenesis of colorectal cancer . There are two isoforms , COX-1 and COX-2 , which differ in physiological functions and distribution . This study is to investigate the possible roles of both isoforms in the proliferation of colon carcinoma cells . A human colon carcinoma cell line , COLO 320DM , was transfected with an eukaryotic expression vector ( pEF-BOS ) carrying cDNA of either COX-1 or COX-2 . Both COX-1 and COX-2-expressing cells exhibited a similar enzyme activity , 8-10 nmol/10 min/mg of protein . Growth rates of both COX-expressing cells were increased by about 2 fold as compared with mock-transfected cells . The stimulated growth of the COX-expressing cells was confirmed by the increased DNA synthesis as assessed by [ 3H]thymidine incorporation . Furthermore , expression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) was markedly increased in the COX-expressing cells as examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . A COX inhibitor , indomethacin , suppressed the stimulated growth , increased DNA synthesis and induction of epidermal growth factor receptor in the COX-1 and COX-2-transfected cells . These results suggest that not only COX-2 but COX-1 is involved in the proliferation of human colon carcinoma cells through the induction of EGFR .
To investigate whether the Bcl-2 gene family is involved in modulating mechanism of apoptosis and change of cell cycle protein induced by curcumin in acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell line and primary acute myelogenous leukemic cells , the Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 , Bax and Bak and cell cycle proteins including P27kipl , P21wafl , cyclin D3 and pRbp- were selected and their expression detected by SABC immuno-histochemical stain method . The attitude of sub-G1 peak in DNA histogram was determined by FCM . The TUNEL positive cell percentage was identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TdT)-mediated Biotin dUNP end labeling technique . It was found that when HL-60 cells were treated with 25 mumol/L curcumin for 24 h , the expression level of Mcl-1 was down-regulated , but that of Bax and Bak up-regulated time-dependently . There was significant difference in the expression level of Mcl-1 , Bax and Bak between the curcumin-treated groups and control group ( P < 0.05-0.01 ) . At the same time , curcumin had no effect on progress of cell cycle in primaty acute myelogenous leukemia at newly diagnosis , but could increase the peak of Sub-G1 ( P < 0.05 ) , and down-regulate the expression of Mcl-1 and up-regulate the expression of Bax and Bak with the difference being statistically significant . The expression of P27kipl , P21wafl and pRbp- were elevated and that of cyclin D3 decreased in the presence of curcumin . These findings suggested that the Bcl-2 gene family indeed participated in the regulatory process of apoptosis induced by curcumin in HL-60 cells and AML cells . Curcumin can induce apoptosis of primary acute myelogenous leukemic cells and disturb cell cycle progression of HL-60 cells . The mechanism appeared to be mediated by perturbing G0/G1 phases checkpoints which associated with up-regulation of P27kipl , P21wafl and pRbp- expression , and down-regulation of cyclin D3 .
Expression of angiogenic factors is upregulated in hyperplastic mucosa adjacent to colon cancer , and this upregulation is closely associated with cancer growth and metastasis . We investigated the role of histone acetylation in vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) expression in hyperplastic mucosa adjacent to orthotopic colon cancer in mice . In the hyperplastic mucosa adjacent to KM12SM tumor in the cecum of athymic mice , VEGF upregulation was associated with hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF)-1alpha induction . The hyperplastic mucosa also showed hypoacetylation of histone H4 and reduction of both p53 and von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) proteins . To examine the effects of growth factors and cytokines on histone acetylation and levels of p53 , VHL and HIF-1alpha , the rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC6 was treated with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and interleukin ( IL)-15 for 35 days . Acetylated histone H4 , p53 protein and ubiquitinated protein levels were reduced , whereas HIF-1alpha production was upregulated in EGF- and IL-15-treated IEC6 cells . These findings suggest that EGF- or IL-15-induced histone H4 hypoacetylation is associated with repression of p53 and VHL genes in intestinal epithelial cells . The subsequent suppression of protein ubiquitination leads to upregulation of VEGF production by HIF-1alpha retention .
Cantharidin is an active constituent of mylabris , a traditional Chinese medicine . It is a potent and selective inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) that plays an important role in control of cell cycle , apoptosis , and cell-fate determination . Owing to its antitumor activity , cantharidin has been frequently used in clinical practice . In the present study , we investigated the therapeutic potential of cantharidin in pancreatic cancer . Cantharidin efficiently inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cells , but presented a much lighter toxicity effect against normal pancreatic duct cells . It caused G2/M cell-cycle arrest that was accompanied by the down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( CDK1 ) and up-regulation of p21 expression . It induced apoptosis and elevated the expressions of pro-apoptotic factors tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , TNF-related apoptosis inducing receptor 1 ( TRAILR1 ) , TRAILR2 , Bad , Bak , and Bid , and decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 . Activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 suggested that both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are involved in the induction of apoptosis . Interestingly , unlike previous studies on other cancer cells , we found that the inhibitory role of cantharidin is independent of oxidative stress in pancreatic cancer cells . Mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , including ERK , JNK , and p38 , were activated after treatment with cantharidin . Inhibition of JNK , but not ERK or p38 , alleviated the cytotoxity effect of cantharidin , suggesting cantharidin exerted its anticancer effect through the JNK-dependent way . Hence , in addition to being an attractive candidate compound with therapeutic potential , cantharidin also highlighted the possibility of using PP2A as a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer treatment .
MG132 , as a proteasome inhibitor , can induce apoptotic cell death through formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . In this study , we investigated the effects of MAPK ( MEK , JNK , and p38 ) inhibitors on MG132-treated A549 lung cancer cells in relation to cell growth , cell death , ROS , and glutathione ( GSH ) levels . Treatment with 10 microM MG132 inhibited the growth of A549 cells at 24 h . MG132 also induced apoptosis , which was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP ; deltapsi(m) ) . ROS were not increased in MG132-treated A549 cells . MG132 increased GSH-depleted cell numbers and decreased GSH levels . MEK and JNK inhibitors did not strongly affect cell growth , cell death , ROS , and GSH levels in MG132-treated A549 cells . In contrast , p38 inhibitor reduced cell growth inhibition , apoptosis , and MMP ( deltapsi(m) ) loss by MG132 . However , p38 inhibitor did not change ROS level and GSH content . In conclusion , MG132 inhibited the growth of A549 cells via apoptosis without formation of ROS . Treatment with p38 inhibitor rescued some cells from MG132-induced apotposis , which was not affected by ROS and GSH level changes .
BACKGROUND/AIMS The use of chemotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma is still controversial . The aim of this study was to investigate whether the combined use of epirubicin and progesterone has a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis in HepG2 cells . METHODOLOGY Different concentrations of epirubicin ( 0.1 microg/ml , 0.25 microg/ml and 0.5microg/ml ) or progesterone ( 12.5 microM , 25 microM and 50 microM ) were added to HepG2 cells either alone or in combinations consisting of different concentrations of the two . Their effects on HepG2 cells were studied by ( 1 ) XTT assay for analysis of cell proliferation , ( 2 ) 3H-Thymidine incorporation for DNA synthesis , ( 3 ) annexin V-FITC/ propidium iodide ( PI ) flowcytometery for cell apoptosis , ( 4 ) flowcytometry for cell cycle distributions , and ( 5 ) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for expression of cell cycle modulator , cyclin D1 . RESULTS 50 microM progesterone increased both the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of 0.1 microg/ml epirubicin on HepG2 cells at 48 hr culture due to 50 microM progesterone accumulated cells in S phase of the cell cycle and subsequently reduced cyclin D1 expression . These effects on HepG2 cells induced by this combination were comparable to those induced by 0.5 microg/ml epirubicin alone . CONCLUSIONS In vitro , progesterone can increase the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by epirubicin on HepG2 cells .
Recent research has shown that the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit is a novel anti-cancer target , which plays pivotal roles in malignant cell ion transport , metabolism , migration and signal transduction . The purpose of the present study was to investigate the anti-cancer effects of ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 small interfering ribonucleic acid ( siRNA ) on HepG2 cell proliferation , apoptosis and cell cycle , and to explore the molecular mechanisms . The expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , normal liver tissues and human HCC line ( HepG2 , SMMC-7721 and Bel-7402 ) has been investigated . Using the ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit siRNA , which target the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase , we have evaluated the effects of inhibiting Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 in human HepG2 cells with respect to cell proliferation , morphology , cell cycle , impact on intracellular Ca2++ , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) concentration , and correlated gene expression level on messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) and protein . Our data showed that the expression Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in HCC tissues is higher than that in normal liver tissues . Ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 siRNA could inhibit HepG2 cell proliferation . Ouabain could induce HepG2 cell apoptosis and generate S phase arrest , and siRNA could enhance the anti-cancer effect of ouabain that induced HepG2 cells apoptosis via an intracellular Ca(2+) and ROS increase-mediated , and generated cell cycle S phase arresting by decreasing the CyclinA1/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ( CDK2)/proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) complex product and increasing the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A ( P21(CIP1) ) . We believe that targeting of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in human HCC cells could provide new sight into the treatment of HCC .
Hypoxia is one of the inevitable circumstances of various tumors . It controls various levels of regulation in tumor progression and results in tumor resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy . Here we investigated a synthetic TPZ derivative , N-ethoxymethyl-3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1,4-dioxide ( XQ2 ) , a novel compound that induced anti-cancer effects both in normoxia and in hypoxia , cell proliferation assay found that XQ2 exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on the tested cancer cell lines both in normoxia and in hypoxia . Flow cytometry and western blot studies indicated that XQ2 induces G2/M arrest and a caspase-dependent apoptosis in A549 cells . Additionally , intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) appear to play a key role in the anticancer effect of XQ2 in hypoxia . Taken together , our data suggest that XQ2 exerted anticancer action by suppressing the ROS level and triggering cell-cycle arrest and the caspase-dependent pathway , which is associated with apoptosis .
The biological activities of tocotrienols are receiving increasing attention . Herein , we report the efficacy of a mixed-tocotrienol diet against prostate tumorigenesis in the transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate ( TRAMP ) mouse model . Male TRAMP mice , 8 wk old , were fed 0.1% , 0.3% , or 1% mixed tocotrienols in AIN-76A diet up to 24 wk old . Likewise , a positive control group consisting of male TRAMP mice and a negative control group consisting of wild-type nontransgenic mice were fed regular AIN-76A diet up to 24 wk old . Our results show that mixed-tocotrienol-fed groups had a lower incidence of tumor formation along with a significant reduction in the average wet weight of genitourinary apparatus . Furthermore , mixed tocotrienols significantly reduced the levels of high-grade neoplastic lesions as compared to the positive controls . This decrease in levels of high-grade neoplastic lesions was found to be associated with increased expression of proapoptotic proteins BAD ( Bcl(2) antagonist of cell death ) and cleaved caspase-3 and cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 . In contrast , the expression of cyclins A and E were found to be decreased in mixed-tocotrienol groups . Taken together , our results show that by modulating cell cycle regulatory proteins and increasing expression of proapoptotic proteins , mixed tocotrienols suppress prostate tumorigenesis in the TRAMP mice .
In this study , we compared the effects of SKI-606 with Iressa , Src/Abl and EGF-R kinase inhibitors , respectively , on selected parameters in HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cell lines , which express E6/E7 oncoproteins of high-risk HPV types 18 and 16 , respectively . Our results show that SKI-606 and Iressa inhibit cell proliferation and provoke G(0)-G(1) cell cycle arrest and reduction of S and G(2)-M phase using 2 and 5 muM concentrations of these inhibitors . In contrast , SKI-606 induces differentiation to an epithelial phenotype " mesenchymal-epithelial transition " ; thus SKI-606 causes a dramatic decrease in cell motility and invasion abilities of HeLa and SiHa cancer cells , in comparison to untreated cells and Iressa-treated cells in which these parameters are only slightly affected . These changes are accompanied by a regulation of the expression patterns of E-cadherin and catenins . The molecular pathway analysis of Src/Abl inhibitor revealed that SKI-606 blocks the phosphorylation of beta-catenin and consequently converts its role from a transcriptional regulator to a cell-cell adhesion molecule . Our findings indicate that SKI-606 inhibits signaling pathways involved in regulating tumor cell migration and invasion genes via beta-catenin alteration , suggesting that Src inhibitor , in comparison to EGF-R , is a promising therapeutic agent for human cervical cancer .
Aberrant expression and polymorphism of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 ( FGFR4 ) has been linked to tumor progression and anticancer drug resistance . We describe here a novel mechanism of tumor progression by matrix degradation involving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in response to membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase ( MT1-MMP , MMP-14 ) induction at the edge of tumors expressing the FGFR4-R388 risk variant . Both FGFR4 and MT1-MMP were upregulated in tissue biopsies from several human cancer types including breast adenocarcinomas , where they were partially coexpressed at the tumor/stroma border and tumor invasion front . The strongest overall coexpression was found in prostate carcinoma . Studies with cultured prostate carcinoma cell lines showed that the FGFR4-R388 variant , which has previously been associated with poor cancer prognosis , increased MT1-MMP-dependent collagen invasion . In this experimental model , knockdown of FGFR4-R388 or MT1-MMP by RNA interference blocked tumor cell invasion and growth in collagen . This was coupled with impaired phosphorylation of FGFR substrate 2 and Src , upregulation of E-cadherin , and suppression of cadherin-11 and N-cadherin . These in vitro results were substantiated by reduced MT1-MMP content and in vivo growth of prostate carcinoma cells after the FGFR4-R388 gene silencing . In contrast , knockdown of the alternative FGFR4-G388 allele enhanced MT1-MMP and invasive tumor cell growth in vivo and within three-dimensional collagen . These results will help to explain the reported association of the FGFR4-R388 variant with the progression and poor prognosis of certain types of tumors .
Current palliative chemotherapy ( CT ) regimens achieve clinical benefits in less than 50% of patients treated for metastatic gastric cancers , and long-term survivals are anecdotical . Genetic polymorphisms and differences at the level of transcription in genes involved in biological processes of drug metabolism , DNA repair and drug resistance can explain the observed individual differences in response to drugs , in survival and in different susceptibility to the toxic effects of CT . The possibility to classify patients on the basis of genetic signatures could help in choosing the CT regimen . We present herein an analysis of genetic and expression profiling of three patients affected by metastatic gastric cancer , treated with CT and alive , disease-free , at 66-82 months . Four patients with typical clinical outcome represented the control group . Expression profiling from paraffin-embedded tumor tissues was performed on an ad hoc set of genes involved in drug metabolism and resistance , DNA repair , cell cycle regulation and growth factors signalling . Genetic polymorphism analysis on DNA extracted from peripheral blood was done by pyrosequencing of genetic markers predictive of drug response . Expression analysis in long-term survivors revealed a significant upregulation of PTEN , TP63 , GADD45a and MAPK1 genes . We found also an upregulation of CYP1A1 , CYP3A4 and ERBB4 genes . EGF was found to be down-regulated in long-term survivors . ERCC1 C8092A polymorphism seems to be associated with survival in our set of patients . The present study shed light on a set of genes , which could have a predictive role in survival of patients with metastatic gastric tumors .
Estrogen receptor alpha ( ERalpha ) expression in breast cancer is predictive of response to endocrine therapy ; however , resistance is common in ERalpha-positive tumors that overexpress the growth factor receptor ERBB2 . Even in the absence of estrogen , ERalpha can be activated by growth factors , including the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) . EGF induces a transcriptional program distinct from estrogen ; however , the mechanism of the stimulus-specific response is unknown . Here we show that the EGF-induced ERalpha genomic targets , its cistromes , are distinct from those induced by estrogen in a process dependent on the transcription factor AP-1 . The EGF-induced ERalpha cistrome specifically regulates genes found overexpressed in ERBB2-positive human breast cancers . This provides a potential molecular explanation for the endocrine therapy resistance seen in ERalpha-positive breast cancers that overexpress ERBB2 . These results suggest a central role for ERalpha in hormone-refractory breast tumors dependent on growth factor pathway activation and favors the development of therapeutic strategies completely antagonizing ERalpha , as opposed to blocking its estrogen responsiveness alone .
Overexpression of the melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 ( MDA-7)/IL-24 in vitro generally results in the growth suppression and induction of apoptosis of diverse human tumor cells . In this study , we investigated the effects of overexpression of the MDA-7/IL-24 gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells in vitro and in vivo . Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of MDA-7 facilitated the MDA-7/IL-24-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in HCC cells , but not in the normal liver cell line L02 , and the effect was independent of the p53 status . Inhibition of metastasis and angiogenesis was correlated with decreasing expression of STAT3 , P-STAT3 , MMP-2 , VEGF , and TGF-beta genes , regulated by STAT3 in MHCCLM6 cells . We also showed that Ad.mda-7 combined with doxorubicin ( ADM ) had significantly enhanced antitumor and antimetastatic effects in vivo , accompanied by the downregulation of VEGF , MMP-2 , and TGF-beta genes and the upregulation of E-cadherin genes . These data suggested that MDA-7/IL-24 induces its selective antitumor properties in HCC cells by promoting apoptosis independent of p53 status , inhibiting subcutaneous tumor growth and metastasis , and increasing the effect of chemotherapeutic agents . MDA-7/IL-24 represents a new class of cancer suppressor genes that may be useful in the targeted therapy of HCC .
BACKGROUND Breast cancer is less common in China than in the United States and perinatal characteristics predict breast cancer risk in the offspring . We determined levels of pregnancy hormones in Boston and Shanghai to identify those possibly involved in the intrauterine origin of breast cancer . Participants and methods : We compared maternal and cord blood levels of estradiol , estriol , testosterone , progesterone , prolactin , insulin-like growth factors ( IGF ) 1 and 2 , insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 , adiponectin and sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG ) in 241 Caucasian and 295 Chinese women . RESULTS In both centers , hormone levels at the 16th were predictive of those at the 27th gestational week , but there was little correlation between maternal and cord blood levels . In cord blood , we found significantly ( P < 0.01 ) higher levels of estradiol ( 44.2% ) , testosterone ( 54.5% ) , IGF-2 ( 22.7% ) and strikingly SHBG ( 104.6% ) in Shanghai women , whereas the opposite was true for IGF-1 ( -36.8% ) . CONCLUSIONS Taking into account the current understanding of the plausible biological role of the examined endocrine factors , those likely to be involved in the intrauterine origin of breast cancer are SHBG and IGF-2 , with higher cord blood levels among Chinese , and IGF-1 , with higher cord blood levels among Caucasian women .
p38 kinases activated by growth factors , hormones , and environmental stresses exert diverse functions in regulating normal and malignant cell pathophysiology . Enhanced levels of activated p38 isoforms have been linked with poor prognosis in breast cancer , although the mechanistic basis for this association is poorly understood . In this study , we report that p38 activation in cervical cancer cells is driven by osteopontin ( OPN ) , an extracellular matrix-associated cytokine that drives invasive progression . OPN regulates CD44-mediated p38 phosphorylation that induces NF-kappaB activation and NF-kappaB-dependent expression of furin , an extracellular protease implicated in human papilloma virus ( HPV ) processing that enhances cervical cancer cell motility . OPN induces CD44-mediated MKK3/6 phosphorylation which in turn phosphorylates p38 in these cells . OPN-induced furin expression and cell motility was impeded by blockades to MKK3/6 , p38alpha/beta or NF-kappaB signaling . In a mouse xenograft model of human cervical cancer , tumor growth was enhanced by OPN overexpression and blocked by short hairpin RNA ( shRNA)-mediated OPN silencing . Furin overexpression similarly augmented tumor growth in the model , whereas blocking MKK3/6 , p38 , or furin reduced OPN-induced cervical tumor growth . Analysis of clinical specimens revealed that enhanced expression of OPN , phosphorylated NF-kappaB , p65 , and furin correlated with cervical cancer progression , further strengthening the in vitro and in vivo results . In summary , our findings offer a proof of concept for targeting OPN and its downstream p38 signaling as a novel therapeutic strategy to manage cervical cancer .
BACKGROUND Though an increased efficacy of carmustine and temozolomide ( TMZ ) has been demonstrated by inactivation of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) with O(6)-benzyl-guanine ( BG ) in human pancreatic tumors refractive to alkylating agents , the regulatory mechanisms have not been explored . METHODS The effects of TMZ and BG on apoptosis , cell growth , the mitotic index , cell cycle distribution , and protein expression were studied by TUNEL , cell counting , flow cytometry , and Western blot analysis , respectively . RESULTS The wt-p53 human pancreatic tumor cell line Capan-2 and p53-efficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were more responsive to treatment with TMZ + BG than mutant p53 Capan-1 and p53-null MEFs . S phase delay with a subsequent G2/M arrest was observed in Capans in response to BG + TMZ . The G1-to-S transition delay in Capan-2 was associated with p53-dependent apoptosis and was distinctly different from the presumed mismatch repair ( MMR ) killing operative during the G2/M arrest . The effect of p53 on BG + TMZ toxicity was supported by a marked change in apoptosis when p53 function was restored/inactivated . There was an early induction of MMR proteins in p53-efficient lines . CONCLUSION p53 provokes a classic proapoptotic response by delaying G1-to-S progression , but it may also facilitate cell killing by enhancing MMR-related cell cycle arrest and cell death .
We investigated the priming effect and mechanism of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in chemotherapy with low-dose Ara-C and VP-16 for acute myeloid leukemia . We analyzed cell proliferation , apoptosis , and cell cycle in vitro using leukemia cell lines 32Dcl3 , U937 , HL-60 , and Ba/F3 . Cell proliferation assays were performed using the Trypan Blue dye exclusion method . For detection of apoptosis , the Annexin V-binding capacity of treated cells was examined by flow cytometry . To evaluate the cell cycle , we used an FITC BrdU Flow kit and conducted analysis by flow cytometry . The combination of Ara-C and VP-16 significantly enhanced the observed effects compared with those of Ara-C or VP-16 alone . Concurrent administration of G-CSF further reduced the cell number and viability of 32Dcl3 and U937 cells , but not of HL-60 and Ba/F3 cells . Apoptotic cells were significantly increased in number by the addition of G-CSF to 32Dcl3 and U937 cells , while G-CSF had no significant effect on HL-60 and Ba/F3 cell lines . The addition of G-CSF significantly decreased the percentage of G0/G1-phase cells and significantly increased that of S-phase cells among 32Dcl3 and U937 cells . No significant effect was observed for HL-60 and Ba/F3 cells . An enhancement was confirmed for the combination of Ara-C , VP-16 , and G-CSF for 32Dcl3 and U937 cells but not for HL-60 and Ba/F3 cells . It was thought that this difference was a result of different responses to G-CSF . G-CSF potentiates Ara-C- and VP-16-induced cytotoxicities through apoptosis induction by mobilizing resting G0-G1-phase cells into S phase .
Lewis y ( LeY ) antigen is a difucosylated oligosaccharide carried by glycoconjugates on the cell surface . Overexpression of LeY is frequently observed in epithelial-derived cancers and has been correlated to the pathological staging and prognosis . However , the effects of LeY on ovarian cancer are not yet clear . Previously , we transfected the ovarian cancer cell line RMG-I with the alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase gene to obtain stable transfectants , RMG-I-H , that highly express LeY . In the present study , we examined the proliferation , tumorigenesis , adhesion and invasion of the cell lines with treatment of LeY monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) . Additionally , we examined the expression of TGF-beta1 , VEGF and b-FGF in xenograft tumors . The results showed that the proliferation and adhesion in vitro were significantly inhibited by treatment of RMG-I-H cells with LeY mAb . When subcutaneously inoculated in nude mice , RMG-I-H cells produced large tumors , while mock-transfected cells RMG-I-C and the parental cells RMG-I produced small tumors . Moreover , the tumor formation by RMG-I-H cells was inhibited by preincubating the cells with LeY mAb . Notably , the expression of TGF-beta1 , VEGF and b-FGF all increased in RMG-I-H cells . In conclusion , LeY plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation , tumorigenecity and adhesion , and these effects may be related to increased levels of growth factors . The LeY antibody shows potential application in the treatment of LeY-positive tumors .
Despite the deployment of multimodal therapies involving neurosurgical resection , radio- and polychemotherapy , the prognosis for glioblastoma patients remains poor . These tumors are pathologically characterized by their associated angiogenesis and diffuse brain invasion , processes that are probably closely linked to the unfavorable prognosis of this disease . Accordingly , pharmacological inhibition of glioblastoma invasion and approaches that impede angiogenesis are considered to be promising therapeutic strategies to combat these tumors . Nevertheless , the anti-angiogenic therapies for glioblastoma currently available are transient and palliative at best . Blocking the effects of fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) may represent a novel mean of inhibiting the angiogenesis associated with glioblastoma , as it mediates the angiogenesis induced by other factors and it is an angiogenic factor by itself . In addition , the survival of glioma cells and their resistance to chemotherapeutic agents are highly FGF-dependent . We show here that a recently described inhibitor of FGF , 2,5-dihydroxyphenyl-sulfonate ( 2,5DHPS , dobesilate ) , stimulates the apoptosis of tumor cells , inhibits glioblastoma invasion and suppresses its associated angiogenesis . Moreover , this agent augments the efficiency of chemotherapeutic agents in a rat model of orthotopic brain tumor . These results suggest that 2,5DHPS treatment may represent a promising therapy for malignant glioma .
Melanoma cells express and interact with laminins ( LMs ) and other basement membrane components during invasion and metastasis . In the present study we have investigated the production and migration-promoting activity of laminin isoforms in melanoma . Immunohistochemistry of melanoma specimens and immunoprecipitation/western blotting of melanoma cell lines indicated expression of laminin-111/121 , laminin-211 , laminin-411/421 , and laminin-511/521 . Laminin-332 was not detected . In functional assays , laminin-111 , laminin-332 , and laminin-511 , but not laminin-211 and laminin-411 , strongly promoted haptotactic cell migration either constitutively or following stimulation with insulin-like growth factors . Both placenta and recombinant laminin-511 preparations were highly active , and the isolated recombinant IVa domain of LMalpha5 also promoted cell migration . Function-blocking antibodies in cell migration assays revealed alpha6beta1 integrin as the major receptor for laminin-111 , and both alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1 integrins for laminin-332 and laminin-511 . In contrast , isolated LMalpha5 IVa domain-promoted melanoma cell migration was largely mediated via alphaVbeta3 integrin and inhibited by RGD peptides . Given the ubiquitous expression of alpha5 laminins in melanoma cells and in melanoma-target tissues/anatomical structures , as well as the strong migration-promoting activity of these laminin isoforms , the alpha5 laminins emerge as putative primary extracellular matrix mediators of melanoma invasion and metastasis via alpha3beta1 and other integrin receptors .
BACKGROUND NFkappaB signaling is of paramount importance in the regulation of apoptosis , proliferation , and inflammatory responses during human development and homeostasis , as well as in many human cancers . Receptor Tyrosine Kinases ( RTKs ) , including the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors ( FGFRs ) are also important in development and disease . However , a direct relationship between growth factor signaling pathways and NFkappaB activation has not been previously described , although FGFs have been known to antagonize TNFalpha-induced apoptosis . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Here , we demonstrate an interaction between FGFR4 and IKKbeta ( Inhibitor of NFkappaB Kinase beta subunit ) , an essential component in the NFkappaB pathway . This novel interaction was identified utilizing a yeast two-hybrid screen [ 1 ] and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis . We demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation of IKKbeta in the presence of activated FGFR4 , but not kinase-dead FGFR4 . Following stimulation by TNFalpha ( Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha ) to activate NFkappaB pathways , FGFR4 activation results in significant inhibition of NFkappaB signaling as measured by decreased nuclear NFkappaB localization , by reduced NFkappaB transcriptional activation in electophoretic mobility shift assays , and by inhibition of IKKbeta kinase activity towards the substrate GST-IkappaBalpha in in vitro assays . FGF19 stimulation of endogenous FGFR4 in TNFalpha-treated DU145 prostate cancer cells also leads to a decrease in IKKbeta activity , concomitant reduction in NFkappaB nuclear localization , and reduced apoptosis . Microarray analysis demonstrates that FGF19 + TNFalpha treatment of DU145 cells , in comparison with TNFalpha alone , favors proliferative genes while downregulating genes involved in apoptotic responses and NFkappaB signaling . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These results identify a compelling link between FGFR4 signaling and the NFkappaB pathway , and reveal that FGFR4 activation leads to a negative effect on NFkappaB signaling including an inhibitory effect on proapoptotic signaling . We anticipate that this interaction between an RTK and a component of NFkappaB signaling will not be limited to FGFR4 alone .
BACKGROUND Hesperidin , a flavanone present in citrus fruits , has been identified as a potent anticancer agent because of its proapoptotic and antiproliferative characteristics in some tumor cells . However , the precise mechanisms of action are not entirely understood . AIM The main purpose of this study is to investigate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) in hesperidin's anticancer actions in human pre-B NALM-6 cells , which expresses wild-type p53 . METHODS The effects of hesperidin on cell-cycle distribution , proliferation , and caspase-mediated apoptosis were examined in NALM-6 cells in the presence or absence of GW9662 . The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) , p53 , phospho-IkappaB , Bcl-2 , Bax , and XIAP proteins were focused on using the immunoblotting assay . The transcriptional activities of PPARgamma and nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) were analyzed by the transcription factor assay kits . The expression of PPARgamma and p53 was analyzed using the RT-PCR method . RESULTS Hesperidin induced the expression and transcriptional activity of PPARgamma and promoted p53 accumulation and downregulated constitutive NF-kappaB activity in a PPARgamma-dependent and PPARgamma-independent manner . The growth-inhibitory effect of hesperidin was partially reduced when the cells preincubated with PPARgamma antagonist prior to the exposure to hesperidin . CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study clearly demonstrate that hesperidin-mediated proapoptotic and antiproliferative actions are regulated via both PPARgamma-dependent and PPARgamma-independent pathways in NALM-6 cells . These data provide the first evidence that hesperidin could be developed as an agent against hematopoietic malignancies .
BACKGROUND Prostate cancer ( PCa ) progression is often associated with transactivation of the androgen receptor ( AR ) by endogenous hormones/growth factors . One such factor affecting growth , proliferation , and apoptostis ( pro-/anti- ) in various cancers is the adipokine leptin . This research studied leptin-induced signaling and apoptosis in androgen sensitive ( LNCaP , PC3/AR ) and insensitive ( PC3 , DU145 ) PCa cell lines . METHODS Signaling was studied by immunoblotting in cells overexpressing leptin receptors ( LRb ) , Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) , and kinase negative-HER2-YFP cDNAs . Apoptosis was measured by immunoblotting of apoptotic proteins and by Hoechst staining of condensed DNA . RESULTS Leptin rapidly induced activation of JAK2 , STAT3 , and MAPK ( ERK1/2 ) signaling cascades ; it may also induce HER2 transactivation via leptin-induced phospho-JAK2 . Leptin was then shown to exert clear pro-apoptotic effects , increasing levels of caspase 3 , cleavage of its substrate , poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) to cleaved PARP(89) , levels of CK 18 , a cytoskeletal protein formed during apoptosis , and DNA condensation . Kinase inhibitors indicated that leptin-induced apoptosis is probably mediated by balanced activation of JAK2/STAT3 , p38 MAPK , and PKC pathways in PCa cells . A human leptin mutein LRb antagonist , L39A/D40A/F41A , fully inhibited leptin-induced phosphorylation of JAK2 , ERK1/2 , and Akt/PKB , and partially abrogated effects on apoptotic proteins . In LNCaP and PC3/AR cells , leptin increased AR protein levels in correlation with raised apoptotic markers . Thus , AR may mediate , at least partly , the leptin-induced apoptotic response . CONCLUSIONS Leptin can clearly induce apoptosis in human PCa cell lines . These findings could lead to development of new leptin agonists with enhanced pro-apoptotic effects and targeted for use in human PCa .
BACKGROUND Androgens and the androgen receptor ( AR ) play important roles in the development of male urogenital organs . We previously found that mice with total AR knockout ( ARKO ) and epithelial ARKO failed to develop normal prostate with loss of differentiation . We have recently knocked out AR gene in smooth muscle cells and found the reduced luminal infolding and IGF-1 production in the mouse prostate . However , AR roles of stromal fibroblasts in prostate development remain unclear . METHODS To further probe the stromal fibroblast AR roles in prostate development , we generated tissue-selective knockout mice with the AR gene deleted in stromal fibroblasts ( FSP-ARKO ) . We also used primary culture stromal cells to confirm the in vivo data and investigate mechanisms related to prostate development . RESULTS The results showed cellular alterations in the FSP-ARKO mouse prostate with decreased epithelial proliferation , increased apoptosis , and decreased collagen composition . Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that FSP-ARKO mice have defects in the expression of prostate stromal growth factors . To further confirm these in vivo findings , we prepared primary cultured mouse prostate stromal cells and found knocking down the stromal AR could result in growth retardation of prostate stromal cells and co-cultured prostate epithelial cells , as well as decrease of some stromal growth factors . CONCLUSIONS Our FSP-ARKO mice not only provide the first in vivo evidence in Cre-loxP knockout system for the requirement of stromal fibroblast AR to maintain the normal development of the prostate , but may also suggest the selective knockdown of stromal AR might become a potential therapeutic approach to battle prostate hyperplasia and cancer .
OBJECTIVE : Emerging evidences implicate long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) are deregulated in cancer development . The purpose of the current study is to investigate the role of new lncRNA , named PlncRNA-1 , in prostate cancer ( CaP ) pathogenesis . MATERIALS AND METHODS : In this study , real-time q-PCR was used to demonstrate the expression of PlncRNA-1 in 16 pairs CaP tissues and matched normal tissues , 14 pairs CaP tissues and BPH tissues , 4 CaP cell lines , including LNCaP , LNCaP-AI , PC3 , and C4-2 , and 2 normal prostate epithelial cell lines RWPE-1 and PWR-1E . After PlncRNA-1 was suppressed by siRNA in LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cell lines , cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using CCK-8 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) . After PlncRNA-1 and AR was suppressed by siRNA in LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cell lines , real-time q-PCR and Western blotting were used to measure reciprocal regulation of PlncRNA-1 and AR . RESULTS : We showed that expression PlncRNA-1 , was significantly higher in CaP cells relative to normal prostate epithelial cells , as well as higher in human CaPs compared with normal tissues and benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) . Silencing of PlncRNA-1 significantly reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in CaP cell lines LNCaP and LNCaP-AI . Mechanistically , PlncRNA-1 suppression by siRNA resulted in a decrease of androgen receptor ( AR ) mRNA , protein and AR downstream target . Of note , blockade of AR signaling with siRNA also resulted in a suppression of PlncRNA-1 expression in CaP cell lines . CONCLUSIONS : Our study suggests reciprocal regulation of PlncRNA-1 and androgen receptor contribute to CaP pathogenesis and that PlncRNA-1 is a potential therapy target .
A novel series of N(4)-(3-chlorophenyl)-5-(oxazol-2-yl)pyrimidine-4,6-diamines were synthesized and evaluated as dual inhibitors of HER-1/HER-2 tyrosine kinases . In contrast to the currently approved HER-2-targeted agent ( lapatinib , 1 ) , our irreversible HER-1/HER-2 inhibitors have the potential to overcome the clinically relevant and mutation-induced drug resistance . The selected compound ( 19a ) showed excellent inhibitory activity toward HER-1/HER-2 tyrosine kinases with selectivity over 20 other kinases and inhibited the proliferation of both cancer cell types : lapatinib-sensitive cell lines ( SK-Br3 , MDA-MB-175 , and N87 ) and lapatinib-resistant cell lines ( MDA-MB-453 , H1781 , and H1975 ) . The excellent pharmacokinetic profiles of 19a in mice and rats led us to further investigation of a novel therapeutic agent for HER-2-targeting treatment of solid tumors , especially HER-2-positive breast/gastric cancer and HER-2-mutated lung cancer .
Keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF , fibroblast growth factor-7 ) is a fibroblast-derived mitogen , which stimulates proliferation of epithelial cells . The expression of KGF by dermal fibroblasts is induced following injury and it promotes wound repair . However , the role of KGF in cutaneous carcinogenesis and cancer progression is not known . We have examined the role of KGF in progression of squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the skin . The expression of KGF receptor ( KGFR ) mRNA was lower in cutaneous SCCs ( n = 6 ) than in normal skin samples ( n = 6 ) . Expression of KGFR mRNA was detected in 6 out of 8 cutaneous SCC cell lines and the levels were downregulated by 24-h treatment with KGF . KGF did not stimulate SCC cell proliferation , but it reduced invasion of SCC cells through collagen . Gene expression profiling of three cutaneous SCC cell lines treated with KGF for 24 h revealed a specific gene expression signature characterized by upregulation of a set of genes specifically downregulated in SCC cells compared to normal epidermal keratinocytes , including genes with tumor suppressing properties ( SPRY4 , DUSP4 , DUSP6 , LRIG1 , PHLDA1 ) . KGF also induced downregulation of a set of genes specifically upregulated in SCC cells compared to normal keratinocytes , including genes associated with tumor progression ( MMP13 , MATN2 , CXCL10 , and IGFBP3 ) . Downregulation of MMP-13 and KGFR expression in SCC cells and HaCaT cells was mediated via ERK1/2 . Activation of ERK1/2 in HaCaT cells and tumorigenic Ha-ras-transformed HaCaT cells resulted in downregulation of MMP-13 and KGFR expression . These results provide evidence , that KGF does not promote progression of cutaneous SCC , but rather suppresses the malignant phenotype of cutaneous SCC cells by regulating the expression of several genes differentially expressed in SCC cells , as compared to normal keratinocytes .
BACKGROUND The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a validated therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . However , current single agent receptor targeting does not achieve a maximal therapeutic effect , and some mutations confer resistance to current available agents . In the current study we have examined , in different NSCLC cell lines , the combined effect of RNA interference targeting the EGFR mRNA , and inactivation of EGFR signaling using different receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) or a monoclonal antibody cetuximab . METHODS NSCLC cells ( cell lines HCC827 , H292 , H358 , H1650 , and H1975 ) were transfected with EGFR siRNA and/or treated with the TKIs gefitinib , erlotinib , and afatinib , and/or with the monoclonal antibody cetuximab . The reduction of EGFR mRNA expression was measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR . The down-regulation of EGFR protein expression was measured by western blot , and the proliferation , viability , caspase3/7 activity , and apoptotic morphology were monitored by spectrophotometry , fluorimetry , and fluorescence microscopy . The combined effect of EGFR siRNA and different drugs was evaluated using a combination index . RESULTS EGFR-specific siRNA strongly inhibited EGFR protein expression almost equally in all cell lines and inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis in all NSCLC cell lines studied , albeit with a different magnitude . The effects on growth obtained with siRNA was strikingly different from the effects obtained with TKIs . The effects of siRNA probably correlate with the overall oncogenic significance of the receptor , which is only partly inhibited by the TKIs . The cells which showed weak response to TKIs , such as the H1975 cell line containing the T790M resistance mutation , were found to be responsive to siRNA knockdown of EGFR , as were cell lines with downstream TKI resistance mutations . The cell line HCC827 , harboring an exon 19 deletion mutation , was more than 10-fold more sensitive to TKI proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction than any of the other cell lines . Cetuximab alone had no relevant in vitro activity at concentrations obtainable in the clinic . The addition of EGFR siRNA to either TKIs or cetuximab additively enhanced growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in all five cell lines , independent of the EGFR mutation status ( wild-type or sensitizing mutation or resistant mutation ) . The strongest biological effect was observed when afatinib was combined with an EGFR-specific siRNA . CONCLUSIONS EGFR knockdown by siRNA further decreases the cell growth of lung cancer cells that are treated with TKIs or cetuximab alone , confirming that single agent drug targeting does not achieve a maximal biological effect . The siRNA inhibits EGFR oncogenic activity that bypasses downstream " resistance " mutations such as KRAS and PTEN . The combined treatment of siRNA and EGFR inhibitory agents is additive . The combination of a potent , irreversible kinase inhibitor such as afatinib , with EGFR-specific siRNAs should be further investigated as a new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer and other EGFR dependent cancers , including those with downstream resistance mutations .
BACKGROUND Adenosine receptors ( A1 , A2A , A2B , A3 ) play an important role in the regulation of growth , proliferation and death of cancer and normal cells . We recently showed the expression profile of A2A and A2B receptors in normal and tumor breast tissues . In the present study , we used semiquantitative RT-PCR to measure the A1 and A3 gene expression levels in normal and tumor breast tissues . METHODS Breast tumors ( n = 18 ) and non-neoplastic mammary tissues ( n = 10 ) were collected and histologically confirmed to be neoplastic or non-neoplastic , respectively . Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into cDNA , and PCR was performed under optimized condition for each receptor subtype . Amplification of beta-actin mRNA served as control for RT-PCR . The PCR products were separated on 1.7% agarose gels . The intensity of the bands was quantitated with ImageJ software after normalization against beta-actin expression . RESULTS All breast tumor and normal tissue specimens expressed A1 and A3 adenosine receptor transcripts . However , we observed that the expression level of the A3 receptor in tumor tissues was 1.27-fold that of normal tissues , whereas there was no significant difference between the expression levels of A1 in normal and tumor tissues . CONCLUSIONS Interestingly , the results of the present study indicate that breast tumors exhibit a higher level of A3 transcripts ( than normal tissues ) and support the possible key role of A3 adenosine receptor in tumor development . However , further studies based on real-time quantitative RT-PCR are needed to identify the exact gene expression levels .
BACKGROUND Tissue factor ( TF ) , an initiator of blood coagulation , participates in cancer progression and metastasis . We recently found that inhibition of MAPK/ERK upregulated both full length TF ( flTF ) and soluble isoform TF ( asTF ) gene expression and cell-associated TF activity in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells . We explored the possible mechanisms , especially the possible interaction with EGFR and PI3K/Akt pathways . METHODS A plasmid containing TF promoter -2174 plus luciferase reporter gene was introduced into MDA-MB-231 cells to evaluate TF promoter activity . In order to study the interaction of these pathways , ERK inhibitor ( PD98059 ) , PI3K inhibitors ( LY294002 , wortmannin ) , Akt inhibitor ( A6730 ) , and EGFR inhibitor ( erlotinib ) as well as the corresponding siRNAs were used to treat MDA-MB-231 cells , and ovarian cancer OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells . Quantitative PCR and western blot were used to determine TF expression . One stage clotting assays were used to measure pro-coagulation activity of the MDA-MB-231 cells . RESULTS We show that PI3K inhibitors LY294002 , wortmannin and A6730 significantly inhibited TF promoter activity , and reduced TF mRNA and protein levels due to the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation . In contrast , ERK inhibitor PD98059 and ERK siRNA enhanced TF promoter activity by 2.5 fold and induced an increase in TF mRNA and protein levels in a dose dependent manner in these cells . The PI3K/Akt pathway was shown to be involved in PD98059-induced TF expression because the induction was inhibited by PI3K/Akt inhibitors . Most interestingly , the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib and EGFR siRNA also significantly suppressed PD98059- or ERK siRNA-induced TF promoter activity and TF protein expression . Similar results were found with ovarian cancer cells SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 . Furthermore , in MDA-MB-231 , mRNA levels of asTF were regulated in a similar way to that of TF in response to the cell treatment . CONCLUSIONS This study showed a regulatory mechanism in which MAPK/ERK signals inhibit EGFR/PI3K/Akt-mediated TF expression in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells . The same regulation was observed in ovarian cancer OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells . Interestingly , we observed that both flTF and asTF could be regulated in a parallel manner in MDA-MB-231 . As the PI3K/Akt pathway and EGFR regulate TF expression in cancer cells , targeting these signaling components is expected to potentially inhibit TF expression-associated tumor progression .
Cyclin E2 , but not cyclin E1 , is included in several gene signatures that predict disease progression in either tamoxifen-resistant or metastatic breast cancer . We therefore examined the role of cyclin E2 in antiestrogen resistance in vitro and its potential for therapeutic targeting through cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibition . High expression of CCNE2 , but not CCNE1 , was characteristic of the luminal B and HER2 subtypes of breast cancer and was strongly predictive of shorter distant metastasis-free survival following endocrine therapy . After antiestrogen treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells , cyclin E2 mRNA and protein were downregulated and cyclin E2-CDK2 activity decreased . However , this regulation was lost in tamoxifen-resistant ( MCF-7 TAMR ) cells , which overexpressed cyclin E2 . Expression of either cyclin E1 or E2 in T-47D breast cancer cells conferred acute antiestrogen resistance , suggesting that cyclin E overexpression contributes to the antiestrogen resistance of tamoxifen-resistant cells . Ectopic expression of cyclin E1 or E2 also reduced sensitivity to CDK4 , but not CDK2 , inhibition . Proliferation of tamoxifen-resistant cells was inhibited by RNAi-mediated knockdown of cyclin E1 , cyclin E2 , or CDK2 . Furthermore , CDK2 inhibition of E-cyclin overexpressing cells and tamoxifen-resistant cells restored sensitivity to tamoxifen or CDK4 inhibition . Cyclin E2 overexpression is therefore a potential mechanism of resistance to both endocrine therapy and CDK4 inhibition . CDK2 inhibitors hold promise as a component of combination therapies in endocrine-resistant disease as they effectively inhibit cyclin E1 and E2 overexpressing cells and enhance the efficacy of other therapeutics .
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the effects of the environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) . Recently , AHR has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer by virtue of its ability to modulate estrogen receptor-alpha ( ERalpha ) signalling and/or its ability to block cell proliferation . Our previous studies identified cyclin G2 ( CCNG2 ) , an inhibitor of cell-cycle progression , as an AHR target gene ; however , the mechanism of this regulation is unknown . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in T-47D human breast cancer cells revealed a TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR , nuclear co-activator 3 ( NCoA3 ) and the transcription factor forkhead box A1 ( FOXA1 ) , a key regulator of breast cancer cell signaling , to CCNG2 resulting in increases in CCNG2 mRNA and protein levels . Mutation of the AHR response element ( AHRE ) and forkhead-binding sites abolished TCDD-induced CCNG2-regulated reporter gene activity . RNA interference-mediated knockdown of FOXA1 prevented the TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR and NCoA3 to CCNG2 and reduced CCNG2 mRNA levels . Interestingly , knockdown of FOXA1 also caused a marked decrease in ERalpha , but not AHR protein levels . However , RNA interference-mediated knockdown of ERalpha , a negative regulator of CCNG2 , had no effect on TCDD-dependent AHR or NCoA3 recruitment to or expression of CCNG2 . These findings show that FOXA1 , but not ERalpha , is essential for AHR-dependent regulation of CCNG2 , assigning a role for FOXA1 in AHR action .
The secretin receptor ( SR ) , a G protein-coupled receptor , mediates the effects of the gastrointestinal hormone secretin on digestion and water homeostasis . Recently , high SR expression has been observed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas , cholangiocellular carcinomas , gastrinomas , and bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumors . Receptor overexpression associates with enhanced secretin-mediated signaling , but whether this molecule plays an independent role in tumorigenesis is currently unknown . We recently discovered that pheochromocytomas developing in rats affected by the MENX ( multiple endocrine neoplasia-like ) syndrome express at very high-level Sctr , encoding SR . We here report that SR are also highly abundant on the membranes of rat adrenal and extraadrenal pheochromocytoma , starting from early stages of tumor development , and are functional . PC12 cells , the best characterized in vitro pheochromocytoma model , also express Sctr at high level . Thus , we used them as model to study the role of SR in neoplastic transformation . Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Sctr decreases PC12 cells proliferation and increases p27 levels . The proproliferative effect of SR in PC12 cells is mediated , in part , by the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K)/serine-threonine protein kinase ( AKT ) pathway . Transfection of Sctr in Y1 adrenocortical carcinoma cells , expressing low endogenous levels of Sctr , stimulates cell proliferation also , in part , via the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade . Because of the link between SR and PI3K/AKT signaling , tumor cells expressing high levels of the receptor ( MENX-associated primary pheochromocytoma and NCI-H727 human bronchopulmonary carcinoid cells ) respond well and in a SR-dependent manner to PI3K inhibitors , such as NVP-BEZ235 . The association between SR levels and response to PI3K inhibition might open new avenues for the treatment of tumors overexpressing this receptor .
Recent evidence indicates that the estrogen receptor-alpha-negative , androgen receptor ( AR)-positive molecular apocrine subtype of breast cancer is driven by AR signaling . The MDA-MB-453 cell line is the prototypical model of this breast cancer subtype ; its proliferation is stimulated by androgens such as 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) but inhibited by the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) via AR-mediated mechanisms . We report here that the AR gene in MDA-MB-453 cells contains a G-T transversion in exon 7 , resulting in a receptor variant with a glutamine to histidine substitution at amino acid 865 ( Q865H ) in the ligand binding domain . Compared with wild-type AR , the Q865H variant exhibited reduced sensitivity to DHT and MPA in transactivation assays in MDA-MB-453 and PC-3 cells but did not respond to non-androgenic ligands or receptor antagonists . Ligand binding , molecular modeling , mammalian two-hybrid and immunoblot assays revealed effects of the Q865H mutation on ligand dissociation , AR intramolecular interactions , and receptor stability . Microarray expression profiling demonstrated that DHT and MPA regulate distinct transcriptional programs in MDA-MB-453 cells . Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed that DHT- but not MPA-regulated genes were associated with estrogen-responsive transcriptomes from MCF-7 cells and the Wnt signaling pathway . These findings suggest that the divergent proliferative responses of MDA-MB-453 cells to DHT and MPA result from the different genetic programs elicited by these two ligands through the AR-Q865H variant . This work highlights the necessity to characterize additional models of molecular apocrine breast cancer to determine the precise role of AR signaling in this breast cancer subtype .
Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide . Major risk factors of HCC include infection with hepatitis B or C viruses , alcohol and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . HCC is difficult to diagnose at early stage , and has a very poor survival rate when diagnosed at a late stage . The majority of HCC-related deaths result from local invasion ( to cause liver failure ) or distant metastases . There is an urgent need to identify effective molecular targets for the treatment of the disease . As the target of an established class of therapeutic agent thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) has been widely studied for its role in the development of HCC . A substantial body of evidence based on in vitro and in vivo models indicates that the activation of PPARgamma is able to inhibit HCC cell proliferation and tumor growth through inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the regulation of a panel of downstream effector molecules . PPARgamma activation also induces an inhibitory effect on HCC metastasis . Meanwhile , there is new evidence suggesting that PPARgamma inhibition could also be anti-tumorigenic . In the present review , we summarize the available information on the role of PPARgamma in HCC development and spread , and discuss whether PPARgamma activation by TZDs could play a role in the treatment of HCC , summarizing both in vitro and in vivo . Considering the available data , PPARgamma seems to exert beneficial effects against HCC and may therefore represent as a therapeutic target .
Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , accounting for 80% of lung cancers , is the leading cause of all cancer deaths . Previously , we demonstrated that delta-tocotrienol inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation , invasion and induces apoptosis by down-regulation of the Notch-1 signaling pathway . The objective of this study was to investigate whether delta-tocotrienol , could enhance the anticancer effects of cisplatin . Treatment with a combination of delta-tocotrienol and cisplatin resulted in a dose-dependent , significant inhibition of cell growth , migration , invasiveness , and induction of apoptosis in NSCLC cells , as compared to the single agents . This was associated with a decrease in NF-kappaB DNA binding activity , decrease in Notch-1 , Hes-1 , Bcl-2 and increase in cleaved Caspase-3 and PARP expressions . These results suggest that down-regulation of Notch-1 , via inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling pathways by delta-tocotrienol and cisplatin , in combination , could provide a potential novel approach for tumor arrest in NSCLC , while lowering the effective dose of cisplatin .
BACKGROUND : To quantify tumour angiogenesis , microvessel density ( MVD ) has been widely used . We here present a novel angiogenesis marker , microvessel proliferation ( MVP ) , based on dual immunohistochemical staining of nestin and Ki-67 . Immature endothelial cells express nestin , and when co-expressed with the proliferation marker Ki-67 , the number of proliferating immature blood vessels can be measured . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Microvessel proliferation was evaluated in 178 breast cancer samples and estimated by vascular proliferation index ( VPI ) , the ratio between the number of vessels containing proliferating endothelial cells and the total number of immature vessels . RESULTS : High VPI was strongly associated with several markers of aggressive breast cancer , such as negative oestrogen receptor ( ER ) status ( p=0.003 ) , high tumour cell proliferation by Ki-67 ( p=0.004 ) , high p53 expression ( p=0.001 ) , and five profiles for the basal-like phenotype ( odds ratios ( OR ) ; range 3.4-6.3 ) . Also , high VPI was significantly associated with interval detected breast cancer compared with screening detected lesions ( p<0.0005 ) , and adverse outcome in univariate and multivariate survival analysis ( p=0.034 and p=0.022 , respectively ) . CONCLUSION : Microvessel proliferation is a novel marker of ongoing angiogenesis and was associated with aggressive tumour features , basal-like phenotypes , interval presentation , and prognosis in this series of breast cancer .
Overexpression of growth factors and/or their receptors is a common event in malignancy and provides the underlying mechanisms for one of the hallmarks of cancer , uncontrolled proliferation . Mounting evidence suggests that IGF-1 is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of different types of human cancer such as colon , breast , prostate and lung . However , only a few studies have investigated the association between IGF-1 levels and childhood cancer risk . We aimed to compare the IGF-1 serum level in children with de novo malignancies to healthy children , and to assess its relationship with cancer type , stage , metastasis and different disease characteristics . The study was carried out on 100 children ; 50 children with de novo malignancies and 50 healthy children of matched age and gender as a control group . The patients were subjected to a routine work-up for their cancers according to our local standards . Estimation of the serum level of IGF-1 was carried out in the two groups using ELISA . Our results showed that children with cancer had significantly higher levels of IGF-1 than healthy controls of the same age and gender . No association was found between IGF-1 and tumor type , stage , metastasis and other disease characteristics . In conclusion , the IGF-1 serum level is an important indicator of risk for the most prevalent forms of childhood cancer . It may be used to identify children at the highest risk for these cancers and aid in determing who may benefit most from preventive strategies . Given the small number of children in our study , studies with larger populations are required to confirm these results .
OBJECTIVES To investigate the expression of TLR-4 ( toll-like receptor ) on human cervical cancer and find the biological function of the TLR-4 signal system . METHODS The immunohistochemistry method was performed to study the protein expression and distribution of TLR-4 . The viability of HeLa cells was determined by cell viability assay . Cell proliferation was detected by FCM , ELISA and Western blot were used to observe the gene and protein expression of IL-6 and TGF-beta1 in Hela cell lines . RESULTS TLR-4 was over-expressed in cervix cancer , and its activation by LPS promotes proliferation and anti-apoptosis in Hela cells in vitro . Moreover the cell line proliferation increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner . The production of IL-6 and TGF-beta1 were promoted through the activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway .
Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 ( STIP1 ) , a cochaperone that organizes other chaperones , heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) , was recently shown to be secreted by human ovarian cancer cells . In neuronal tissues , binding to prion protein was required for STIP1 to activate the ERK ( extracellular-regulated MAP kinase ) signaling pathways . However , we report that STIP1 binding to a bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor , ALK2 ( activin A receptor , type II-like kinase 2 ) , was necessary and sufficient to stimulate proliferation of ovarian cancer cells . The binding of STIP1 to ALK2 activated the SMAD signaling pathway , leading to transcriptional activation of ID3 ( inhibitor of DNA binding 3 ) , promoting cell proliferation . In conclusion , ovarian-cancer-tissue-secreted STIP1 stimulates cancer cell proliferation by binding to ALK2 and activating the SMAD-ID3 signaling pathways . Although animal studies are needed to confirm these mechanisms in vivo , our results may pave the way for developing novel therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer .
Chromosomal translocations typically impair cell differentiation and often require secondary mutations for malignant transformation . However , the role of a primary translocation in the development of collaborating mutations is debatable . To delineate the role of leukemic translocation NUP98-HOXD13 ( NHD13 ) in secondary mutagenesis , DNA break and repair mechanisms in stimulated mouse B lymphocytes expressing NHD13 were analyzed . Our results showed significantly reduced expression of non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ)-mediated DNA repair genes , DNA Pkcs , DNA ligase4 , and Xrcc4 leading to cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase . Our results showed that expression of NHD13 fusion gene resulted in impaired NHEJ-mediated DNA break repair .
Inorganic arsenic in the drinking water is a multisite human carcinogen that potentially targets the kidney . Recent evidence also indicates that developmental arsenic exposure impacts renal carcinogenesis in humans and mice . Emerging theory indicates that cancer may be a disease of stem cells ( SCs ) and that there are abundant active SCs during early life . Therefore , we hypothesized that inorganic arsenic targets SCs , or partially differentiated progenitor cells ( PCs ) , for oncogenic transformation . Thus , a rat kidney SC/PC cell line , RIMM-18 , was chronically exposed to low-level arsenite ( 500 nM ) for up to 28 weeks . Multiple markers of acquired cancer phenotype were assessed biweekly during arsenic exposure , including secreted matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activity , proliferation rate , colony formation in soft agar , and cellular invasiveness . Arsenic exposure by 10 weeks and after also induced marked and sustained increases in colony formation , indicative of the loss of contact inhibition , and increased invasiveness , both cancer cell characteristics . Compared to the passage-matched control , chronic arsenic exposure caused exposure-duration dependent increases in secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity , Cox-2 expression , and more rapid proliferation ( all >2-fold ) , characteristics typical of cancer cells . Dysregulation of SC maintenance genes and signaling pathways are common during oncogenesis . During arsenite exposure , expression of several genes associated with normal kidney development and SC regulation and differentiation ( i.e. , Wt-1 , Wnt-4 , Bmp-7 , etc. ) were aberrantly altered . Arsenic-exposed renal SCs produced more nonadherent spheroid bodies that grew much more aggressively in Matrigel , typical of cancer SCs ( CSCs ) . The transformed cells also showed gene overexpression typical of renal SCs/CSCs ( CD24 , Osr1 , Ncam ) and arsenic adaptation such as overexpression of Mt-1 , Mt2 , Sod-1 , and Abcc2 . These data suggest that inorganic arsenic induced an acquired cancer phenotype in vitro in these rat kidney SCs potentially forming CSCs and , consistent with data in vivo , indicate that these multipotent SCs may be targets of arsenic during renal carcinogenesis .
When the prostate cancer cells become unresponsive to androgen therapy , resistance to chemotherapy becomes imminent , resulting in high mortality . To combat this situation , lycopodine , a pharmacologically important bioactive component derived from Lycopodium clavatum spores , was tested against hormone sensitive ( LnCaP ) and refractory ( PC3 ) prostate cancer cells in vitro . This study aims to check if lycopodine has demonstrable anti-cancer effects and if it has , to find out the possible mechanism of its action . The MTT assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect . Depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential , cell cycle , EGF receptor activity and apoptosis were recorded by FACS ; profiles of different anti- and pro-apoptotic genes and their products were studied by semi-quantitative RT-PCR , indirect-ELISA , western blotting . Drug-DNA interaction was determined by CD spectroscopy . Administration of lycopodine down-regulated the expression of 5-lipoxygenase and the 5-oxo-ETE receptor ( OXE receptor1 ) and EGF receptor , and caused up-regulation of cytochrome c with depolarization of mitochondrial inner membrane potential , without palpable change in p53 activity , resulting in apoptosis , cell arrest at G0/G1 stage and ultimately reduced proliferation of cancer cells ; concomitantly , there was externalization of phosphotidyl serine residues . CD spectroscopic analysis revealed intercalating property of lycopodine with DNA molecule , implicating its ability to block cellular DNA synthesis . The overall results suggest that lycopodine is a promising candidate suitable for therapeutic use as an anti-cancer drug .
Olfactomedin 4 ( OLFM4 ) is highly expressed in gastrointestinal cancers and has an anti-apoptotic function . The roles of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis and how it functions in these processes remain elusive . We investigated the function of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis using B16F10 mouse melanoma cells as an experimental system . Our results showed that OLFM4 had no positive effect on cell viability or cell cycle progression in B16F10 cells . However , it significantly suppressed the tumorigenicity of B16F10 cells , i.e. , intradermal primary tumor growth and lung metastasis . OLFM4 also suppressed the migration and invasion of B16F10 cells in vitro . For further insight into the mechanisms underlying OLFM4-mediated suppression of tumor progression , we examined the effect of OLFM4 on the expression of integrin and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) , both of which are involved in tumor progression . Overexpression of OLFM4 clearly reduced the expression levels of integrin alpha1 , integrin alpha4 , integrin alpha5 , integrin alpha6 , and MMP9 . Moreover , forced expression of MMP9 attenuated the inhibitory activity of OLFM4 on migration and invasiveness . Our findings provide the experimental evidence that OLFM4 may function as a tumor suppressor and an anti-metastatic gene during tumor progression .
Endothelial cells respond to hypoxic changes with resultant accumulation of several metabolites and switch over to angiogenic phenotype . Although certain intermediates of glycolytic and oxidative metabolic pathways have been known to affect angiogenesis , the effect of citrate , which accumulates in certain tumors , on angiogenesis is not known . Therefore , the effect of citrate on angiogenesis was studied using different model systems . Increased vascularization in chorioallantoic membrane assay , increased endothelial sprouting in rat aortic rings , and increased expression of CD31 , E-selectin in endothelial cells suggested a possible proangiogenic effect of citrate . Upregulation of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor suggested that the effect of citrate involves modulation of expression of angiogenic growth factors . LY 294002 , an inhibitor of PI3K-Akt pathway , and wortmannin , an inhibitor of Akt pathway , reversed the effect of citrate in human umbilical vein endothelial cells . Citrate induced significant upregulation and activation of Akt in endothelial cells . Rapamycin , an inhibitor of mTOR , also reversed the effect of citrate in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and sprouting of aortic rings suggesting that the angiogenic effect of citrate involves activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway .
Many molecular mechanisms contribute to the development of doxorubicin resistance and different cancers can express wide and diverse arrays of drug-resistance genes . The aim of this study was to identify the changes in gene expression associated with the development of doxorubicin resistance in MCF7 breast cancer cell line . The doxorubicin resistant MCF7 cell line was developed by stepwise selection of MCF7 cells and was tested using the MTT assay . The alterations in gene expression were examined using the real-time based PCR array . The findings showed an up-regulation of many phase I/II metabolizing genes , specifically , the CYP1A1 and the CYP1A2 that were up-regulated by 206- and 96-fold respectively . Drug efflux pump genes were also up-regulated profoundly . TOP2A was strongly down-regulated by 202-fold . Many other changes were observed in genes crucial for cell cycle , apoptosis and DNA repair . The findings of this project imply that the development of doxorubicin resistance is a multi-factorial process .
The beta2-adrenergic receptor ( beta2AR ) mediates the effects of chronic stress in several neoplasms , however , beta2AR signaling is impaired by hypoxia in various tissues . While hypoxia is a common feature significant in the progression of solid tumors , little is known about the effect of hypoxia on beta2AR signaling in the tumor microenvironment . Previously , it has been reported that the systemic administration of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) increased the engraftment and metastatic colonization of rat osteosarcoma ( OS ) cells . In the current study , the effect of MSCs on the hypoxia-induced desensitization of the beta2AR in OS cells was investigated . Epinephrine , norepinephrine and isoproterenol increased the cellular proliferation of the rat OS cell line COS1NR and rat MSCs in a dose-dependent and beta2AR antagonist-sensitive manner . While isoproterenol had significant proliferative effects on MSCs under normoxic and hypoxic conditions , COS1NR cells did not respond under hypoxic conditions . A sensitivity assay for the beta2AR revealed that hypoxia impaired the sensitivity of COS1NR cells , whereas hypoxia did not affect MSCs . An immunoassay revealed no significant change in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha ( HIF1alpha ) in COS1NR cells , whilst an immunoassay demonstrated a 15% increase in MSCs following isoproterenol stimulation . In COS1NR cells co-cultured with MSCs under hypoxic conditions , isoproterenol caused a significant increase in proliferation and this effect was inhibited by an anti-interleukin ( IL)-6 antibody . A tumor formation assay in syngeneic rats revealed that the systemic administration of MSCs enhances the growth of OS and the effect of MSCs was inhibited by IL-6 neutralization . In conclusion , MSCs are resistant to the hypoxia-induced desensitization to beta2AR . Hypoxia caused a siginificant desensitization of the beta2AR in COS1NR cells alone , whereas MSCs may support tumor progression through cellular interactions .
Genomic instability drives tumorigenesis , but how it is initiated in sporadic neoplasias is unknown . In early preneoplasias , alterations at chromosome fragile sites arise due to DNA replication stress . A frequent , perhaps earliest , genetic alteration in preneoplasias is deletion within the fragile FRA3B/FHIT locus , leading to loss of Fhit protein expression . Because common chromosome fragile sites are exquisitely sensitive to replication stress , it has been proposed that their clonal alterations in cancer cells are due to stress sensitivity rather than to a selective advantage imparted by loss of expression of fragile gene products . Here , we show in normal , transformed , and cancer-derived cell lines that Fhit-depletion causes replication stress-induced DNA double-strand breaks . Using DNA combing , we observed a defect in replication fork progression in Fhit-deficient cells that stemmed primarily from fork stalling and collapse . The likely mechanism for the role of Fhit in replication fork progression is through regulation of Thymidine kinase 1 expression and thymidine triphosphate pool levels ; notably , restoration of nucleotide balance rescued DNA replication defects and suppressed DNA breakage in Fhit-deficient cells . Depletion of Fhit did not activate the DNA damage response nor cause cell cycle arrest , allowing continued cell proliferation and ongoing chromosomal instability . This finding was in accord with in vivo studies , as Fhit knockout mouse tissue showed no evidence of cell cycle arrest or senescence yet exhibited numerous somatic DNA copy number aberrations at replication stress-sensitive loci . Furthermore , cells established from Fhit knockout tissue showed rapid immortalization and selection of DNA deletions and amplifications , including amplification of the Mdm2 gene , suggesting that Fhit loss-induced genome instability facilitates transformation . We propose that loss of Fhit expression in precancerous lesions is the first step in the initiation of genomic instability , linking alterations at common fragile sites to the origin of genome instability .
Kinins and their receptors have been recently implicated in cancer . Using functional and molecular approaches , we investigated the relevance of kinin B(1) and B(2) receptors in bladder cancer . Functional studies were conducted using bladder cancer cell lines , and human biopsies were employed for molecular studies . Both B(1) des-Arg(9)-BK and B(2) BK receptor agonists stimulated the proliferation of grade 3-derived T24 bladder cancer cells . Furthermore , treatment with B(1) and B(2) receptor antagonists ( SSR240612 and HOE140 ) markedly inhibited the proliferation of T24 cells . Only higher concentrations of BK increased the proliferation of the grade 1 bladder cancer cell line RT4 , while des-Arg(9)-BK completely failed to induce its proliferation . Real-time PCR revealed that the mRNA expression of kinin receptors , particularly B(1) receptors , was increased in T24 cells relative to RT4 cells . Data from bladder cancer human biopsies revealed that B(1) receptor expression was increased in all tumor samples and under conditions of chronic inflammation . We also show novel evidence demonstrating that the pharmacological inhibition of PI3Kgamma ( phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ) with AS252424 , concentration-dependently reduced T24 cell proliferation induced by BK or des-Arg(9)-BK . Finally , the incubation of T24 cells with kinin agonists led to a marked activation of the PI3K/AKT and ERK 1/2 signaling pathways , whereas p38 MAP kinase remained unaffected . Kinin receptors , especially B(1) receptors , appear to be implicated in bladder cancer progression . It is tempting to suggest that selective kinin antagonists might represent potential alternative therapies for bladder cancer .
Heparanase is a mammalian endoglycosidase that degrades heparan sulfate at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix . The expression of heparanase was detected in a wide variety of human malignant tumors and closely associated with tumor invasion , metastasis , and angiogenesis . However , the specific roles of heparanase and its mechanisms of regulating the malignant potential of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells still remain unclear . In the present study , the expression of heparanase was down-regulated in NSCLC cell line by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide . Results showed that down-regulation of heparanase led to significant inhibition of invasive and proliferative potentials of A549 cells in vitro and in vivo . Further research demonstrated that down-regulation of heparanase significantly inhibited the angiogenic potential of A549 cells , which might be the mechanism responsible for the inhibition of A549 cell proliferation in BALB/c nude mice in vivo . These findings demonstrate that heparanase plays essential roles in regulating the invasion , proliferation , and angiogenesis of A549 cells .
Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a clonal disease of plasma cells that remains incurable despite the advent of several novel therapeutics . In this study , we aimed to delineate the impact of snake venom extracted from Walterinnesia aegyptia ( WEV ) alone or in combination with silica nanoparticles ( WEV+NP ) on primary MM cells isolated from patients diagnosed with MM as well as on two MM cell lines , U266 and RPMI 8226 . The IC(50) values of WEV and WEV+NP that significantly decreased MM cell viability without affecting the viability of normal peripheral mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were determined to be 25 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml , respectively . Although both WEV ( 25 ng/ml ) and WEV+NP ( 10 ng/ml ) decreased the CD54 surface expression without affecting the expression of CXCR4 ( CXCL12 receptor ) on MM cells , they significantly reduced the ability of CXC chemokine ligand 12 ( CXCL12 ) to induce actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and the subsequent reduction in chemotaxis . It has been established that the binding of CXCL12 to its receptor CXCR4 activates multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate MM cell chemotaxis , adhesion , and proliferation . We found that WEV and WEV+NP clearly decreased the CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated activation of AKT , ERK , NFkappaB and Rho-A using western blot analysis ; abrogated the CXCL12-mediated proliferation of MM cells using the CFSE assay ; and induced apoptosis in MM cell as determined by PI/annexin V double staining followed by flow cytometry analysis . Monitoring the expression of B-cell CCL/Lymphoma 2 ( Bcl-2 ) family members and their role in apoptosis induction after treatment with WEV or WEV+NP revealed that the combination of WEV with NP robustly decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic effectors Bcl-2 , Bcl(XL) and Mcl-1 ; conversely increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic effectors Bak , Bax and Bim ; and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential in MM cells . Taken together , our data reveal the biological effects of WEV and WEV+NP and the underlying mechanisms against myeloma cancer cells .
Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) is a member of the epidermal growth factor family and has a variety of physiological and pathological functions . Modulation of HB-EGF activity might have a therapeutic potential in the oncology area . We explored the therapeutic possibilities by characterizing the in vitro biological activity of anti-HB-EGF monoclonal antibody Y-142 . EGF receptor ( EGFR ) ligand and species specificities of Y-142 were tested . Neutralizing activities of Y-142 against HB-EGF were evaluated in EGFR and ERBB4 signaling . Biological activities of Y-142 were assessed in cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis assays and compared with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab , the HB-EGF inhibitor CRM197 , and the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) antibody bevacizumab . The binding epitope was determined with alanine scanning . Y-142 recognized HB-EGF as well as the EGFR ligand amphiregulin , and bound specifically to human HB-EGF , but not to rodent HB-EGF . In addition , Y-142 neutralized HB-EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and ERBB4 , and blocked their downstream ERK1/2 and AKT signaling . We also found that Y-142 inhibited HB-EGF-induced cancer cell proliferation , endothelial cell proliferation , tube formation , and VEGF production more effectively than cetuximab and CRM197 and that Y-142 was superior to bevacizumab in the inhibition of HB-EGF-induced tube formation . Six amino acids in the EGF-like domain were identified as the Y-142 binding epitope . Among the six amino acids , the combination of F115 and Y123 determined the amphiregulin cross-reactivity and that F115 accounted for the species selectivity . Furthermore , it was suggested that the potent neutralizing activity of Y-142 was derived from its recognition of R142 and Y123 and its high affinity to HB-EGF . Y-142 has a potent HB-EGF neutralizing activity that modulates multiple biological activities of HB-EGF including cancer cell proliferation and angiogenic activities . Y-142 may have a potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent for the treatment of HB-EGF-dependent cancers .
Sorafenib is a multi-targeted agent and has been reported to have potent antitumor effects against various types of tumors , including human non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . In this study , we explored in vitro the antitumor effects of sorafenib alone and in combination with gemcitabine in epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI)-resistant human lung cancer cell lines and the related molecular mechanisms . The NSCLC cell lines A549 ( mutant KRAS ) , H1666 ( mutant BRAF ) and H1975 ( mutant EGFR-T790M ) were treated with sorafenib and gemcitabine alone and in combination . The cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay , cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry , and alterations in signaling pathways were analyzed by western blotting . We found that sorafenib exhibited dose-dependent growth inhibition in all three EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines . When sorafenib was combined with gemcitabine , synergistic activity was observed in the A549 and H1666 cells and antagonistic activity was observed in the H1975 cells . Sorafenib arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase , whereas gemcitabine arrested the cell cycle at the S phase . Sorafenib inhibited C-RAF and p-ERK in the A549 cells and B-RAF and p-ERK in the H1666 and H1975 cells . The molecular mechanism of this synergism is that RAF/MEK/ERK which are activated by gemcitabine are efficiently suppressed by simultaneously administered sorafenib . By contrast , the mechanism of antagonism may be due to mutual interference with the cell cycle in the H1975 cells . In conclusion , we found that sorafenib exhibits antiproliferative effects in EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines and when combined with gemcitabine demonstrates synergistic activity in A549 and H1666 cells but antagonistic activity in H1975 cells .
PURPOSE : Prostate cancer ( PCa ) development is often associated with deletion or silencing of tumor suppressor PTEN , a negative regulator of the PI3K-Akt pathway , leading to resistance to various therapies . Therefore , the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a central role in various cellular processes leading to malignant phenotype , and , consequently is an attractive target . However , the efficacy of AKT inhibitors is limited by resistance mechanisms that result in minimal tumor cell death . Methods:Effects of Akt inhibitor AZD5363 were investigated on cell proliferation , apoptosis , Akt pathway and survival mechanisms . We then examined the impacts of inhibition of autophagy combined with AZD5363 on cell proliferation and apoptosis . Furthermore , the anti-cancer activity of combination treatment of the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy ( chloroquine ) with Akt inhibitor AZD5363 was evaluated in PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts . RESULTS : we show that AZD5363 affected Akt downstream pathway by reducing p-mTOR , p-P70S6K and p-S6K . While AZD5363 monotherapy induced G2 growth arrest and autophagy , it failed to induce significant apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 PCa cells . Blocking autophagy using pharmacological inhibitors or genetic inhibitors enhanced cell death induced by AZD5363 in these PCa cells . Importantly , the combination of AZD5363 with chloroquine significantly reduced tumor volume by 84.9% compared with the control group and by 77.5% compared with either drug alone in PC3 xenografts . CONCLUSIONS : These data demonstrate that Akt inhibitor AZD5363 , synergizes with the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy , chloroquine , to induce apoptosis and delay tumor progression in PCa models that are resistant to monotherapy AZD5363 , providing a new therapeutic approach potentially translatable to patients .
Members of the Orai family are highly selective calcium ion channels that play an important role in store-operated calcium entry . Among the three known Orai isoforms , Orai3 has gained increased attention , notably for its emerging role in cancer . We recently demonstrated that Orai3 channels are over-expressed in breast cancer ( BC ) biopsies , and involved specifically in proliferation , cell cycle progression and survival of MCF-7 BC cells . Here , we investigate the downstream signaling mechanisms affected by Orai3 silencing , leading to the subsequent functional impact specifically seen in MCF-7 cancer cells . We report a correlation between Orai3 and c-myc expression in tumor tissues and in the MCF-7 cancer cell line by demonstrating that Orai3 down-regulation reduces both expression and activity of the proto-oncogene c-myc . This is likely mediated through the MAP Kinase pathway , as we observed decreased pERK1/2 levels and cell-cycle arrest in G1 phase after Orai3 silencing . Our results provide strong evidence that the c-myc proto-oncogene is influenced by the store-operated calcium entry channel Orai3 through the MAP kinase pathway . This connection provides new clues in the downstream mechanism linking Orai3 channels and proliferation , cell cycle progression and survival of MCF-7 BC cells .
gamma-Tocotrienol and sesamin are phytochemicals that display potent anticancer activity . Since sesamin inhibits the metabolic degradation of tocotrienols , studies were conducted to determine if combined treatment with sesamin potentiates the antiproliferative effects of gamma-tocotrienol on neoplastic mouse ( +SA ) and human ( MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 ) mammary cancer cells . Results showed that treatment with gamma-tocotrienol or sesamin alone induced a significant dose-responsive growth inhibition , whereas combination treatment with these agents synergistically inhibited the growth of +SA , MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 mammary cancer cells , while similar treatment doses were found to have little or no effect on normal ( mouse CL-S1 and human MCF-10A ) mammary epithelial cell growth or viability . However , sesamin synergistic enhancement of gamma-tocotrienol-induced anticancer effects was not found to be mediated from a reduction in gamma-tocotrienol metabolism . Rather , combined treatment with subeffective doses of gamma-tocotrienol and sesamin was found to induce G1 cell cycle arrest , and a corresponding decrease in cyclin D1 , CDK2 , CDK4 , CDK6 , phospho-Rb , and E2F1 levels , and increase in p27 and p16 levels . Additional studies showed that the antiproliferative effect of combination treatment did not initiate apoptosis or result in a decrease in mammary cancer cell viability . Taken together , these findings indicate that the synergistic antiproliferative action of combined gamma-tocotrienol and sesamin treatment in mouse and human mammary cancer cells is cytostatic , not cytotoxic , and results from G1 cell cycle arrest .
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are involved in cancer development and progression , acting as tumor suppressors or oncogenes . In this study , miRNA profiling was performed on 10 paired bladder cancer ( BC ) tissues using 20 GeneChipTM miRNA Array , and 10 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in BC and adjacent noncancerous tissues of any disease stage/grade . After validated on expanded cohort of 67 paired BC tissues and 10 human BC cell lines by qRT-PCR , it was found that miR-100 was down-regulated most significantly in cancer tissues . Ectopic restoration of miR-100 expression in BC cells suppressed cell proliferation and motility , induced cell-cycle arrest in vitro , and inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo both in subcutaneous and intravesical passage . Bioinformatic analysis showed that mTOR gene was a direct target of miR-100. siRNA-mediated mTOR knockdown phenocopied the effect of miR-100 in BC cell lines . In addition , the cancerous metastatic nude mouse model established on the basis of primary BC cell lines suggested that miR-100/mTOR regulated cell motility and was associated with tumor metastasis . Both mTOR and p70S6K ( downstream messenger ) presented higher expression levels in distant metastatic foci such as in liver and kidney metastases than in primary tumor . Taken together , miR-100 may act as a tumor suppressor in BC , and reintroduction of this mature miRNA into tumor tissue may prove to be a therapeutic strategy by reducing the expression of target genes .
Nectin-like molucule-5 ( Necl-5 ) is an immunoglobulin-like molecule that was originally identified as a poliovirus receptor and is often upregulated in cancer cells . It has been said that Necl-5 plays a role in not only cell-cell adhesion , but also cell migration , proliferation , and metastasis . In this study , we used a bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ( BAC ) cell line and fibroblasts to assess the expression of Necl-5 in the development of cancer-stroma communication by using an easy-to-prepare double-layered collagen gel hemisphere ( DL- CGH ) system that enables visualization of cell migration during invasion . The expression of Necl-5 was higher in BAC cells than in fibroblasts . This tendency didn't change even when the BAC cells were mixed with fibroblasts . To assess the role of Necl-5 in the invasive activity of the BAC cells , we knocked down its expression using RNA interference ( RNAi ) . The invasion assay with DL-CGH revealed that inhibitation of Necl-5 expression in the BAC cells was associated with suppressed invasiveness . In addition , Necl-5 knockdown inhibited the movement and proliferation of the BAC cells . Necl-5 expression in lung cancer cells is crucial for their invasiveness in the cancer-stromal interaction , suggesting that Necl-5 could be a favorable molecular target for the suppression of invasiveness in lung adenocarcinoma .
The ALKBH family of proteins are highly expressed in various types of human cancer where they are involved in tumor growth and progression . However , multiple isoforms of ALKBH exist and the effect of individual isoforms on the development of urinary bladder cancer is unknown , particularly the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression from a noninvasive to invasive phenotype . We examined the role and function of ALKBH2 in human bladder cancer development in vitro and provide the first report that suppression of ALKBH2 in a human urothelial carcinoma cell line , KU7 , reduced the expression of the transmembrane mucin protein , MUC1 , and induced G1 cell cycle arrest . Moreover , reduction of ALKBH2 suppressed epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) via increasing E-cadherin and decreasing vimentin expression . Transfection of MUC1 siRNA inhibited cell proliferation and EMT to the same extent as ALKBH2 gene silencing in vitro . ALKBH2 knockdown significantly suppressed MUC1 expression and tumor volume of bladder cancers in vivo as assessed in an orthotopic mouse model using ALKBH2 shRNA transfected KU7 cells . Immunohistochemical examination showed high expression levels of ALKBH2 in human urothelial carcinoma samples , especially in high-grade , superficially and deeply invasive carcinomas ( pT(1) and >pT(2) ) , and in carcinoma in situ but not in normal urothelium . This study demonstrates that ALKBH2 is an upstream molecule of the oncoprotein , MUC1 , and regulates cell cycle and EMT , resulting in progression of urothelial carcinomas .
Aurora kinases play an essential role in mitotic progression and are potentially druggable targets in cancer therapy . We identified benzo[e]pyridoindoles ( BePI ) as powerful aurora kinase inhibitors . Their efficiency was demonstrated both in enzymatic inhibition studies and in cell culture assays . New BePI molecules were synthesized , and a structure-activity relationship study was conducted with the aim of improving the activity and solubility of the lead compound . Tetracyclic BePI derivatives are characterized by a particular curved shape , and the presence of an oxo group on the pyridine ring was found to be required for aurora kinase B inhibition . New hydrosoluble benzo[e]pyridoindolones were subsequently designed , and their efficacy was tested by a combination of cell-cycle analysis and time-lapse experiments in live cells . The most active BePI derivative , 13 b , inhibited the cell cycle , drove cells to polyploidy , and eventually induced apoptosis . It exhibited high antiproliferative activity in HeLa cells with an IC(50) value of 63 nM . Relative to compounds tested in clinical trials , this antiproliferative potency places 13 b among the top 10 aurora kinase inhibitors . Our results justify further in vivo evaluation in preclinical animal models of cancer .
Hormone antagonist therapy for estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) breast cancer patients post radical surgery and radiation therapy has a poor prognosis and also causes bone loss. 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [ 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) ] is a potent antitumor agent in pre-clinical studies , but caused hypercalcemia when its effective antitumor doses were used . Therefore , we investigated the effects of a less-calcemic 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) analog , 19-nor-2alpha-(3-hydroxypropyl)-1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3 )(MART-10 ) , on ER+MCF-7 cells . We demonstrate that MART-10 is 500- to 1000-fold more potent than 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in inhibiting cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner . MART-10 is also much more potent in arresting MCF-7cell cycle progression at G(0)/G(1) phase as compared to 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) , possibly mediated by a greater induction of p21 and p27 expression . Moreover , MART-10 is more active than 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in causing cell apoptosis , likely through a higher BAX/Bcl expression ratio and the subsequent cytochrome C release from mitochondria to cytosol . Based on our in vitro findings , MART-10 could be a promising vitamin D analog for the potential treatment of breast cancer , for example , ER+ patients , to decrease the tumor relapse rate and the side effect on bone caused by antihormone regimens . Thus , further in vivo animal study is warranted .
Background . Multiple myeloma ( MM ) , an almost incurable disease , is the second most common blood cancer . Initial chemotherapeutic treatment could be successful ; however , resistance development urges the use of higher toxic doses accompanied by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . The establishment of more effective treatments that can overcome or circumvent chemoresistance has become a priority . We recently demonstrated that venom extracted from Walterinnesia aegyptia ( WEV ) either alone or in combination with silica nanoparticles ( WEV+NPs ) mediated the growth arrest and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells . In the present study , we evaluated the impact of WEV alone and WEV+NP on proliferation and apoptosis of MM cells . Methods . The impacts of WEV alone and WEV+NP were monitored in MM cells from 70 diagnosed patients . The influences of WEV and WEV+NP were assessed with flow cytometry analysis . Results . WEV alone and WEV+NP decreased the viability of MM cells . Using a CFSE proliferation assay , we found that WEV+NP strongly inhibited MM cell proliferation . Furthermore , analysis of the cell cycle using the propidium iodide ( PI ) staining method indicated that WEV+NP strongly altered the cell cycle of MM cells and enhanced the induction of apoptosis . Conclusions . Our data reveal the biological effects of WEV and WEV+NP on MM cells that enable these compounds to function as effective treatments for MM .
Luteolin is a plant flavonoid which exhibits anti-oxidative , anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects . However , the antiproliferative potential of luteolin is not fully understood . In this study , we investigated the effect of luteolin on cell cycling and apoptosis in human esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line Eca109 cells . MTT assays showed that luteolin had obvious cytotoxicity on Eca109 with an IC50 of 70.7<FFFD>1.72 muM at 24 h . Luteolin arrested cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase and prevented entry into S phase in a dose- and time-dependent manner. as assessed by FCM . Luteolin induced apoptosis of Eca109 cells was demonstrated by AO/EB staining assay and annexin V-FITC/PI staining . Moreover , luteolin downregulated the expression of cyclin D1 , survivin and c-myc , and it also upregulated the expression of p53 , in line with the fact that luteolin was able to inhibit Eca109 cell proliferation .
The aim of this study was to determine whether caffeine enhanced radiosensitivity of normal liver tissue in a rat radiation-induced liver disease model . Buffalo rat McA-RH7777 hepatocellular cancer cells and BRL3A normal liver cells were irradiated , and cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rates were analyzed . A rat model of radiation-induced liver disease was established , rats were randomized into four groups : control ; caffeine alone ; irradiation ( IR ) alone ; and caffeine plus IR ( Caff + IR ) group . Apoptosis rates in normal rat liver tissue after IR were evaluated by TUNEL staining and caspase-3 Western blot . Transaminase activity was measured and histopathological examination was done after IR . Caffeine abrogated IR-induced G2 phase arrest ( Caff + IR vs. IR : 40.9 +/- 4.0 vs. 60.7 +/- 5.5% , at 12 h after IR ) and increased apoptosis rates ( Caff + IR vs. IR : 56.1 +/- 6.8 vs. 35.5 +/- 4.0% , at 72 h after IR ) in McA-RH7777 cells , but did not affect IR-induced G2 phase arrest and apoptosis rates at any time point after IR in BRL3A cells . Caffeine did not enhance apoptosis , transaminase activity , or histopathological injury of normal rat liver tissue at any time points after IR . This study suggests that caffeine might not enhance radiosensitivity of normal liver tissue in vivo . In an earlier study , we reported that caffeine enhanced radiosensitivity of human hepatocellular cancer in a nude mice model . Together , these results offer feasibility of clinical application .
