Intra-arterial infusion with cisplatin ( CDDP ) and bleomycin ( BLM ) was carried out in 21 patients with locally recurrent uterine cervical cancer who were previously treated with irradiation alone . Patients were treated with a bolus infusion into both internal iliac arteries of 50 mg/m2 of CDDP and 30 mg/m2 of BLM . Two to four courses of the infusion therapy were given to each patient , and the response rate , the tumor and serum drug concentrations , and the cell kinetics in tumor tissue were evaluated . The response rate ( CR+PR ) was 71.4% according to the WHO criteria . There was no difference , in the tumor tissue concentrations of CDDP and BLM between responders and nonresponders . Although the DNA ploidy of tumor cells was not significantly different between the two groups before treatment , both the labeling index with BrdU and the proliferation index with flow cytometry significantly increased 24 hours after treatment in responding tumors but not in nonresponding tumors . These results show that intra-arterial infusion with CDDP and BLM improves the prognosis of recurrent cervical cancer and that labeling and proliferation indices may be useful for determining the response of cervical cancer to intra-arterial chemotherapy .
We have isolated rabbit kidney proximal tubular epithelial cell lines . The selection was based on their ability to form confluent monolayers on porous supports and to maintain receptor-mediated signal transduction and ion transport , characteristic of the proximal tubule . The isolation method consisted of several steps : ( 1 ) superficial cortical proximal tubule segments were microdissected and cultured on a matrix-coated porous support until cells formed a confluent monolayer ; ( 2 ) primary cultures showing hormone-regulated ion transport typical for the proximal tubule were selected and co-cultured with irradiated fibroblasts ; and ( 3 ) the epithelial cells surviving after several passages were expanded and passaged on porous substrates . Most of the cell lines developed in this manner were obtained by co-culture with irradiated fibroblasts producing a recombinant retrovirus encoding SV40 large T antigen and G418 resistance . However , SV40 T antigen expression was not essential for immortalization , since neither T antigen nor G418 resistance was detected in the isolated cell lines and co-culture with non-producing 3T3 cells gave similar results . One cell line ( vEPT ) has been characterized in some detail with respect to morphological , biochemical , and ion transport properties . This line forms confluent monolayers with apical microvilli , tight junctions , and convolutions of the basolateral plasma membrane . Once confluent , monolayers maintain conductances of 25 to 32 mS/cm2 for several weeks in culture and possess phlorizin-sensitive short-circuit current ( Isc ) in glucose containing media , indicative of apical Na(+)-glucose co-transport. vEPT cells also retain receptor and signaling mechanisms for angiotensin II ( Ang II ) . Apical and basal Ang II and 5,6-epoxy-eicosatrienoic acid ( 5,6-EET ) modulate the Isc in a manner similar to primary cultures . The cell lines share with primary cultures expression of the cytokeratins K8 , K10/K11 , and K19 ( "nomenclature " [ 21] ) . They also retain several receptor and signal transduction mechanisms . For example , Ang II , arachidonate , bradykinin , 5,6-EET , parathyroid hormone ( residues 1 through 34 ) , and purine nucleotides increase cytosolic Ca2+ , PTH elevates cAMP levels , and Ang II enhances proximal tubule-specific arachidonic acid metabolism .
Basal cell hyperplasia classically has been described as having bland cytologic features . During the past 2 years , we have seen 12 cases ( 11 in consultation ) with atypical features that were confused with adenocarcinoma of the prostate . Eleven of these 12 cases contained prominent nucleoli mimicking carcinoma ; in the 12th case , nuclei were enlarged , hyperchromatic , and moderately pleomorphic . Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against high-molecular-weight cytokeratin ( 34 beta E12 ) was performed in nine of the cases , verifying their basal cell nature . Additional findings in these cases were necrotic intraluminal secretions ( two cases ) , immature squamous metaplasia ( two cases ) , peculiar hyaline cytoplasmic globules ( two cases ) , adenosis ( one case ) , markedly atypical nuclei of uncertain nature occurring elsewhere in the specimen ( one case ) , and intraluminal blue mucin ( two cases ) . We analyzed nine cases of typical basal cell hyperplasia , all of which showed classic features of basal cell hyperplasia with benign cytology . Both atypical and classical basal cell hyperplasia were frequently infiltrated by lymphocytes such that the cytologic changes could not be attributable to inflammation . Atypical basal cell hyperplasia must be differentiated from ordinary adenocarcinoma of the prostate , prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia , and basaloid carcinoma ( adenoid cystic carcinoma ) of the prostate .
Angiogenic factors produced by monocytes-macrophages are involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disorders characterized by persistent angiogenesis . The possibility was tested that interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) , which is a cytokine that is chemotactic for lymphocytes and neutrophils , is also angiogenic . Human recombinant IL-8 was potently angiogenic when implanted in the rat cornea and induced proliferation and chemotaxis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells . Angiogenic activity present in the conditioned media of inflamed human rheumatoid synovial tissue macrophages or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated blood monocytes was equally blocked by antibodies to either IL-8 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha . An IL-8 antisense oligonucleotide specifically blocked the production of monocyte-induced angiogenic activity . These data suggest a function for macrophage-derived IL-8 in angiogenesis-dependent disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis , tumor growth , and wound repair .
We have examined the effect of FK506 on the Adriamycin sensitivity of the multidrug resistant human chronic myelocytic leukemia cell line ( K562/ADM ) . In K562/ADM cells , 1.0 microgram/ml FK506 reversed the resistance of Adriamycin , and increased the IC50 value for Adriamycin up to 17 fold . However , IC50 value for the parent cells ( K562 ) increased only 1.5 fold . By cell cycle analysis , the accumulation in late S-G2M phase was confirmed on K562/ADM cells , treated with 1.0 microgram/ml FK506 and low-dose of Adriamycin . Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) could also restored the Adriamycin sensitivity in the K562/ADM cells , as previously reported. 1.0 microgram/ml FK506 as well as CsA significantly increased radioactive Adriamycin accumulation in K562/ADM cells and blocked [ 3H]azidopien photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein . These results suggest that 1.0 microgram/ml FK506 could reverse the Adriamycin resistance in a MDR human leukemia cells through the interaction with P-glycoprotein .
We have investigated the cellular requirements for IL-2 production by autocrine proliferating tumor cells from four patients with adult T cell leukemia ( ATL ) . Cultures of these ATL cells both produced endogenous IL-2 protein in the absence of added mitogen and proliferated at higher levels when exogenous recombinant IL-2 was added . Depletion of macrophages in the tumor cell cultures resulted in a sharp decline in tumor cell IL-2 production , while re-addition of macrophages reconstituted this response . Macrophage-derived factors including IL-6 and IL-1 also reconstituted IL-2 production in these macrophage depleted cultures . These results raise the possibility that macrophages may play a central role in HTLV-I mediated immortalization of T cells .
Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and transforming growth factor alpha ( TGF alpha ) content was measured in normal ovaries and benign ovarian tumours . Epidermal growth factor was present in 12.7% of normal ovaries , with a range 0.030-0.533 ng/mg DNA , and in 31.8% of benign ovarian tumours , with a range 0.1335-2.080 ng/ml DNA . TGF alpha was present in 84.5% of normal ovaries , with a range of values from 0.037-18.2 ng/mg DNA , and in 84.1% of benign ovarian tumours , with a range of 0.083-195 ng/mg DNA . The TGF alpha content in post menopausal benign ovarian tumours was significantly higher ( P < 0.0001 ) than TGF alpha in the pre-menopausal normal ovarian group . The frequency of detection and levels of TGF alpha measured were significantly higher than those of EGF in the normal ovary group ( P < 0.001 ) and also in the benign ovarian group ( P < 0.005 ) . We conclude that TGF alpha is the predominant growth factor present in normal ovaries and benign ovarian tumours .
FCE 23762 ( 3 ' desamino-3'[2(s)methoxyl-4-morpholinyl]doxorubicin ) is a new doxorubicin ( Dx ) derivative that has been selected for clinical testing for its favourable antitumor characteristics , which include efficacy on Dx-resistant tumors . Immunosuppression is an undesirable side-effect of anti-cancer chemotherapy and the therapeutic efficacy of Dx is probably also related to its low immunotoxicity . It was , thus , of interest to compare the effects of FCE 23762 and its parental drug on the immune responses . Both compounds were injected i.v. into healthy mice at equitoxic doses and according to different treatment schedules . Single doses of FCE 23762 and Dx , given concomitant or after the antigen , suppressed at the same degree and dose-dependently the primary anti-SRBC antibody response . Following a multiple treatment schedule after the antigen , FCE 23762 was less suppressive than Dx on both primary and secondary antibody production . Differently from Dx , that was completely inactive , FCE 23762 moderately inhibited DTH reaction to SRBC , only at the highest single dose tested or for repeated administrations given simultaneously or after priming . Both drugs were totally ineffective in delaying skin allograft rejection . Since spleen cellularity and ex vivo lymphocyte proliferation to Con A and LPS were similarly impaired by the two drugs , the differentiated immunodepressive activity of FCE 23762 and Dx cannot be merely associated to their cytotoxic and antiproliferative action . The hypothesis of a selective effect on different regulatory cell subsets and/or immune mechanisms is discussed .
The effects of high and low dietary fat ( 20% vs. 0.5% corn oil ) , and of the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor indomethacin ( 0.005% w/w ) , on tumour incidence , tumour growth , hormone-receptor status and growth-factor expression were examined in dimethylbenzanthracene ( DMBA)-induced rat breast cancer . The high dietary-fat group showed a significantly higher tumour incidence , larger tumour size and larger number of bromodeoxyuridine(BrdU)-positive cells of tumours as compared with those in the low dietary-fat group . Indomethacin reduced tumour incidence significantly , but conversely increased the tumour size and the number of BrdU-positive cells in both the high and the low dietary-fat groups . No significant difference was noted in the hormone-receptor status of the tumours . Growth factors ( TGF-alpha and IGF-II ) were somewhat highly expressed in the high dietary-fat group as compared with the low dietary-fat group , but indomethacin rather reduced the growth-factor expression . It is concluded that high dietary fat stimulates tumour incidence and tumour proliferation , while indomethacin has dual effects : a stimulating effect on tumour proliferation , but an inhibiting effect on tumour incidence . It is also suggested that hormone-receptor status and growth-factor expression do not play an important role in their stimulating effects on tumour proliferation .
Activated lymphocytes and malignant lymphoma cells derived from them ( Ki-1 positive lymphoma cells ) share similar mechanisms of proliferation . To further examine the inhibitory role of endogenous transforming growth factor beta ( TGF beta ) in Ki-1 positive lymphoma cells , the authors studied anti-TGF beta antibodies and measured their effect on proliferation . A monoclonal antibody ( T1A5 ) prepared against a unique antigenic epitope of high molecular weight Hodgkin's TGF beta and a polyclonal rabbit antibody prepared against highly purified 25,000 D porcine platelet TGF beta 1 were used . Both antibodies are shown here to inhibit the biological activity of Hodgkin's TGF beta and to crossreact with their respective antigens in immunoblotting . DNA synthesis by Ki-1 lymphoma cells was increased 138-fold by anti-TGF beta 1 antibody and 262-fold by anti-Hodgkin's TGF beta . Exogenous TGF beta 1 suppression was completely reversed by anti-TGF beta 1 antibody and IL-2-induced proliferation was markedly potentiated ( 41 fold ) . L-428 Reed-Sternberg cells secrete physiologically active TGF beta but have fewer than 500 TGF beta receptor sites per cell ; no significant proliferative response was measured for either anti-TGF beta 1 or anti-Hodgkin's TGF beta . These results show the suppressive effect of exogenous TGF beta 1 on indolent Ki-1 lymphoma cells and suggest that the endogenous secretion of high molecular weight physiologically active TGF beta is important in maintaining the indolent nature of this low-grade Ki-1 positive lymphoma .
Previous studies have shown that the E7 gene of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) type 16 or 18 alone was sufficient for immortalization of human foreskin epithelial cells ( HFE ) and that the efficiency was increased in cooperation with the respective E6 gene , whereas the HPV6 E6 or E7 gene was not active in HFE . To detect weak immortalizing activities of the HPV6 genes , cells were infected with recombinant retroviruses containing HPV genes , alone and in homologous and heterologous combinations . The HPV6 genes , alone or together ( HPV6 E6 plus HPV6 E7 ) , were not able to immortalize cells . However the HPV6 E6 gene , in concert with HPV16 E7 , increased the frequency of immortalization threefold over that obtained with HPV16 E7 alone . Interestingly , 6 of 20 clones containing the HPV16 E6 gene and the HPV6 E7 gene were immortalized , whereas neither gene alone was sufficient . Thus , the HPV6 E6 and E7 genes have weak immortalizing activities which can be detected in cooperation with the more active transforming genes of HPV16 . Acute expression of the HPV6 and HPV16 E6 and E7 genes revealed that only HPV16 E7 was able to stimulate the proliferation of cells in organotypic culture , resulting in increased expression of the proliferative cell nuclear antigen and the formation of a disorganized epithelial layer . Additionally , combinations of genes that immortalized HFE cells ( HPV16 E6 plus HPV16 E7 , HPV16 E6 plus HPV6 E7 , and HPV6 E6 plus HPV16 E7 ) also stimulated proliferation .
The oncogenic potential of a human papillomavirus type 16 ( HPV16 ) variant cloned from normal human cervical keratinocytes has been tested in vitro using primary rodent epithelial cells and human cervical keratinocytes . The HPV16 variant was able to extend the lifespan of , but failed to immortalize , human keratinocytes . It could however cooperate with an activated ras oncogene to transform primary rodent cells . Radioimmunoprecipitation assays of the rodent cells showed that they expressed the E7 protein . DNA sequence analysis of the URR/E6/E7 and E5 regions of the HPV16 showed them to be fully functional , but a deletion in the viral E2 open reading frame was detected . This truncated E2 only weakly stimulated transcription of the viral regulatory region . Complementation assays using the HPV16 variant and a full-length E2 enabled the cloned variant to immortalize human cervical keratinocytes with wild-type efficiency . These results suggest that other viral gene products in addition to E6/E7 may play an important role in the in vitro immortalization of cervical keratinocytes in HPV16 and the development of cervical cancer .
The " high-risk " human papillomavirus types 16 ( HPV-16 ) and 18 ( HPV-18 ) have been etiologically implicated in the majority of human cervical carcinomas . In these cancers , the viral DNAs are often integrated into the host genome so that expression of the E1 and the E2 genes is lost , suggesting that disruption of these regulatory genes plays an important role in carcinogenic progression . Previous studies defining the viral genes affecting HPV-16 transformation functions have used the " prototype " viral genome , which was cloned from a human cervical carcinoma and later discovered to harbor a mutation in the E1 gene . In this study , we have corrected this mutation and have evaluated the effect of mutations of either the E1 or the E2 gene on the efficiency of HPV-16 immortalization of human keratinocytes . Mutation of either the E1 gene or the E2 gene in the background of a " wild-type " HPV-16 genome markedly increased immortalization capacity . Mutations were also generated in the E2-binding sites located upstream of the P97 promoter , which directs synthesis of the viral E6 and E7 transforming genes . E2 negatively regulates the P97 promoter through binding at adjacent sites . Surprisingly , the mutation of these sites only partially relieved the negative effect of E2 on viral immortalization , implicating additional mechanisms in the E2 repression of viral immortalization functions . Our results provide genetic evidence that the E1 and E2 gene products each can repress HPV-16 immortalization and support the hypothesis that a selective growth advantage is provided by integration of the viral genome in a manner that causes the loss of expression of either E1 or E2 .
Human papillomavirus type 16 ( HPV16 ) E6 and E7 are selectively retained and expressed in HPV16-associated human genital tumors . E6 is active in several cell culture assays , including transformation of NIH 3T3 cells , trans activation of the adenovirus E2 promoter , and cooperation with E7 to immortalize normal human keratinocytes . Biochemically , the HPV16 E6 protein has been shown to bind to tumor suppressor protein p53 in vitro and induce its degradation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate . To examine the relationship between the various biological activities of E6 and inactivation of p53 , we tested the abilities of dominant negative mutants of p53 to substitute functionally for E6 in the three cell culture assays . While wild-type p53 inhibited keratinocyte proliferation , both mouse and human mutant p53s , in conjunction with E7 , increased proliferation of the keratinocytes , resulting in generation of immortalized lines . However , in contrast to E6 , mutant p53 was unable to induce transformation or trans activate the adenovirus E2 promoter in NIH 3T3 cells . These results suggest that inactivation of wild-type p53 is necessary for HPV-induced immortalization of human keratinocytes and that different or additional activities are required for E6-dependent transformation and trans activation of NIH 3T3 cells .
In order to determine the in vivo immune response in glioblastoma , monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specific for inflammatory leukocytes and immunoregulatory products were utilized to stain tissue from four surgical specimens . The more activated the inflammatory cells , the more activated the tumors appeared to be . In the tumor with the largest infiltration ( Case 3 ) , inflammatory cells were stained for interferon-gamma , interleukin-2 , interleukin-1 beta , lymphotoxin , tumor necrosis factor-alpha , and transforming growth factor-beta . The tumor cells also expressed interleukin-1 beta , interleukin-6 , transforming growth factor-beta , tumor necrosis factor-alpha , and prostaglandin E. In contrast , in the tumor with the least inflammatory response ( Case 1 ) , the tumor cells did not express any cytokines . Expression of cytokines by glioma cells was modest in the two cases with modest inflammatory responses . Cellular inflammation , primarily consisting of T cells and macrophages with few or no B cells or natural killer cells , was two- to 15-fold greater outside the tumor than within . In contrast to leukocytes outside the tumor , which were activated and expressing class II major histocompatibility antigens , leukocytes within the tumor parenchyma or at the tumor's edge were negative for these antigens . In the four specimens studied here , the tumor cells themselves were also negative for class II major histocompatibility antigens . These findings , although preliminary , suggest that inflammatory cells within gliomas are inactivated and that glioma cells may increase the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines in response to an increased lymphocyte infiltrate . This observation , if corroborated by more extensive studies , may help to explain the failure of immune treatments in glioblastoma multiforme .
NIH-3T3 cells are non-tumorigenic when injected into athymic mice . If these cells are mixed with an extract of basement-membrane proteins ( matrigel ) and injected s.c. , they form locally invasive and highly vascularized tumors . Cells cultured from the NIH-3T3-matrigel-induced tumors showed a transformed phenotype and lacked contact inhibition . When cultured in a gel of matrigel , they proliferated and formed branched and invasive colonies . In contrast , the parental NIH-3T3 cells cultured on matrigel remained as cell aggregates and were not invasive . I.V. injections of the tumor-derived NIH-3T3 cells produced many colonies on the surface of the lungs , whereas the parental NIH-3T3 cells were not metastatic . Zymographic analysis of the conditioned media obtained from both the tumor-derived and parental NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated higher amounts of the 72-kDa gelatinase ( type-IV collagenase ) enzyme in the tumor-derived cells . Also , tumor-derived NIH-3T3 cells , but not parental NIH-3T3 cells , secreted the 92-kDa type-IV collagenase . These studies suggest that the interaction of pre-malignant NIH-3T3 cells with extracellular matrix components may contribute to the process of tumor progression .
Elevated serum levels of vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) are associated with some cases of neuroblastoma and correlate with a favorable prognosis . VIP has previously been shown in our laboratory to cause the in vitro growth inhibition and morphological differentiation of the human neuroblastoma cell line , LA-N-5 . It is now shown that LA-N-5 cells express immunoreactive VIP and bear specific VIP receptors . Antagonism of endogenous VIP , either by competitive inhibition or receptor blockade , increased cell proliferation , suggesting that VIP is operative in normal growth regulation . Intracellular and extracellular levels of VIP were also shown to increase significantly during the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of these cells . Furthermore , a concomitant marked increase in VIP receptor expression was demonstrated with cellular differentiation . These receptors remain functional as evidenced by a matching increase in the level of detectable cAMP generated in response to exogenous VIP . It is concluded that VIP is a normal autoregulator of neuroblastoma cell growth and differentiation , and that retinoic acid-mediated differentiation may be , in part , due to endogenous VIP .
Semi-conservative replication of double-stranded DNA in eukaryotic cells is an asymmetric process involving leading and lagging strand synthesis and different DNA polymerases . We report a study to analyze the effect of these asymmetries when the replication machinery encounters alkylation-induced DNA adducts . The model system is an EBV-derived shuttle vector which replicates in synchrony with the host human cells and carries as marker gene the bacterial gpt gene . A preferential distribution of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea ( MNU)-induced mutations in the non transcribed DNA strand of the shuttle vector pF1-EBV was previously reported . The hypermutated strand was the leading strand . To test whether the different fidelity of DNA polymerases synthesizing the leading and the lagging strands might contribute to MNU-induced mutation distribution the mutagenesis study was repeated on the shuttle vector pTF-EBV which contains the gpt gene in the inverted orientation . We show that the base substitution error rates on an alkylated substrate are similar for the replication of the leading and lagging strands . Moreover , we present evidence that the fidelity of replication opposite O6-methylguanine adducts of both the leading and lagging strands is not affected by the 3 ' flanking base . The preferential targeting of mutations after replication of alkylated DNA is mainly driven by the base at the 5 ' side of the G residues .
Melanocyte stimulating hormone ( alpha-MSH , alpha-melanotropin),Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Ly-Pro-Va l-NH2 , regulates melanogenesis within epidermal melanocytes of many animals . An MSH analogue ( [ Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH ) that exhibits superpotency and prolonged biological activity has been synthesized , biologically characterized , and is presently in clinical trials to determine its possible clinical use in tanning of the skin . It also has potential for the diagnosis , localization , and chemotherapy of melanoma . The effects of this analogue on the growth , metastatic behavior , and invasive potential of a melanotic variant of Cloudman S-91 murine melanoma are reported here . In an intracutaneous murine model of melanoma cell tumor growth , the analogue did not increase primary tumor growth ( size ) after the period of administration of the peptide hormone analogue and did not affect spontaneous lung metastases . Survival times for the control and melanotropin-treated groups were similar , suggesting that overall tumor burden was not affected by treatment with the hormone analogue . Last , melanoma cell invasion through a human amniotic basement membrane in vitro was not enhanced compared to untreated cells .
The involvement of signal transduction systems in the initial attachment of two murine B16 melanoma clones of differing metastatic potential to extracellular matrix components was examined to learn more of the early events in cell-matrix interaction . Clones of high and low metastatic capacity attached similarly in the absence of any stimulators , exhibiting a two phase time course of attachment with 100% attachment by 60 min . A slight difference in attachment characteristics between the clones was seen in response to phorbol ester stimulation , which significantly inhibited attachment of the low metastatic clone but which had no effect on the highly metastatic clone . Total protein kinase C activity and distribution was similar for both clones . Attachment of both clones was severely reduced , however , if intracellular calcium was elevated or intracellular calmodulin inhibited . This study suggests that signal transduction mechanisms are involved in melanoma cell attachment to matrix proteins and offers an approach to pharmacological manipulation of these cell-matrix interactions which may be relevant to reducing metastatic spread .
Normal human lung fibroblast diploid cells , WI-38 , become senescent after a definite number of divisions . VA-13 is a line of immortalized cells established by transformation of WI-38 cells by SV40 virus . To determine whether SV40 large T ( SV40-T ) antigen is essential for this immortalization of WI-38 cells we introduced an antisense gene for T antigen into VA-13 . Two morphologically different types of antisense transformant ( VA-AS5-8 and VA-AS37-8 ) were obtained . In both antisense transformants the expression of T antigen was reduced by more than 70% as compared to that in the parent cells . The morphology of the antisense transformants indicated a partial conversion to the senescent phenotype of WI-38 . The relative number of cells in the S phase of the antisense transformants was decreased as compared to that in cultures of VA-13 and about 50% of cells were at G1/0 . The doubling time of the transformants was prolonged to close to the doubling time of WI-38 . The level of expression of retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) complexed with SV40-T antigen of the antisense transformants was significantly decreased although the level of total pRB was much higher than that in VA-13 . The pRB was present exclusively in the underphosphorylated form . Thus , the decreased level of formation of the complex between SV40-T and pRB or the underphosphorylation of pRB may explain the suppression of growth of antisense transformants . Together , these results show that an antisense gene for SV40-T antigen can efficiently block the cell proliferation and the cell immortalization of VA-13 cells .
The modifying effects of an immunosuppressive agent , 6-mercaptopurine ( 6-MP ) , on development of focal lesions in liver cirrhosis models induced by carbon tetrachloride ( CCl4 ) or furfural were studied in male F344 rats . Feeding of 6-MP at 50 p.p.m. for 20 weeks to animals with pre-existing liver cirrhosis caused immunosuppression , and significantly enhanced the induction of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase ( GGT)-positive foci and nodules in the CCl4 but not furfural case . Glutathione S-transferase P ( GST-P)-positive preneoplastic lesions were not affected . Moreover , phenobarbital ( PB ) also enhanced the induction of GGT-positive hepatocellular lesions only in the CCl4-induced liver cirrhosis model , no promotion influence being exerted after treatment with the non-carcinogenic furfural . This study , therefore , suggests that 6-MP can enhance the induction of one type of preneoplastic foci and nodules and that essential differences exist between focal lesions arising in cirrhotic livers caused by CCl4 as opposed to furfural .
Amplification of the HER-2 ( c-erbB-2 ) gene and overexpression of the p185HER-2 gene product is found in approximately one-third of primary human breast and ovarian cancers and is associated with a poor clinical outcome of early relapse and death . The HER-2 gene encodes a cell-surface growth factor receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity . Wild-type human HER-2 has been shown to act as a potent oncogene when over-expressed in mouse fibroblasts . Recent data suggest that the mechanism by which HER-2 mediates transformation requires the interaction of the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor . To test whether overexpression of normal human HER-2 can transform cells independently of the EGF receptor , we have introduced multiple copies of HER-2 into the EGF receptor-negative cell line , NR6 , and have performed assays for both transformation and tumorigenicity . Engineered NR6 cells that overexpress the HER-2 gene product display a highly transformed and tumorigenic phenotype as compared with control cells . Additionally , a monoclonal antibody to the extracellular domain of the HER-2 receptor is able to inhibit the proliferation of the overexpressing cells in vitro as well as tumor growth in vivo . This study provides clear evidence that HER-2-mediated transformation can be achieved independently of the EGF receptor .
Three normal human diploid cell strains were transfected with an activated Ha-ras oncogene ( EJ ras ) or SV40 T-antigen . Multiple clones were examined for morphological alterations , growth requirements , ability to grow under anchorage independent conditions , immortality and tumorigenicity in nude mice . Clones expressing SV40 T-antigen alone or in combination with ras protein p21 were significantly radioresistant as compared with their parent cells or clones transfected with the neo gene only . This radioresistant phenotype persisted in post-crisis , immortalized cell lines . Cells transfected with EJ ras alone showed no morphological alterations nor significant changes in radiosensitivity . Cell clones expressing ras and/or SV40 T-antigen showed a reduced requirement for serum supplements , an increase in aneuploidy and chromosomal aberrations , and enhanced growth in soft agar as an early cellular response to SV40 T-antigen expression . The sequential order of transfection with SV40 T-antigen and ras influenced radio-sensitivity but not the induction of morphological changes . These data suggest that expression of the SV40 T-antigen but not activated Ha-ras plays an important role in the radiosensitivity of human diploid cells . The radioresistant phenotype in SV40 T transfected cells was not related to the enhanced level of genetic instability seen in pre-crisis and newly immortalized cells , nor to the process of immortalization itself .
One of the immunosuppressive effects of both ultraviolet ( UV ) light and chemical carcinogens is to deplete Langerhans cells ( LC ) from the epidermis , suggesting that these cells play an important role in inducing immune responses to developing tumors during the early phases of carcinogenesis . Retinoids such as all-trans-retinoic acid ( RA ) are natural or synthetic derivatives of vitamin A ; RA binds to nuclear receptors in the skin , effecting transcription of a wide range of genes . Topical application of RA prevents the tumor promotor 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) from depleting the density of LC in murine epidermis . In contrast , topical RA did not itself alter the normal LC density . RA also inhibited the development of TPA-induced immunosuppression to a locally applied contact sensitizer . Topical RA also prevented UV light from reducing the density of both LC and Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells ( Thy-1+ dEC ) . However , the RA treatment did not prevent local immunosuppression to the contact sensitizer from developing in response to UV irradiation . The reasons for this are unclear , however , it is possible that RA does not inhibit some other immunosuppressive effect of UV light . Temarotene , a recently developed synthetic retinoid also inhibited UV light from reducing the LC and Thy-1+ dEC density from murine epidermis . Thus part of the anti-carcinogenic activity of retinoids may be due to their ability to protect LC during the early stages of carcinogenesis .
Results generated by the immunohistochemical staining with PC10 , a new monoclonal antibody recognizing PCNA ( a nuclear protein associated with cell proliferation ) in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue were compared with those of Ki-67 labeling and DNA flow cytometry in 47 consecutive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . PCNA reactivity was observed in all samples and confined to the nuclei of cancer cells . Its frequency ranged from 0 to 80% ( 37.7 +/- 23.6 ) and larger sized , early-staged and DNA aneuploid tumors expressed a significant higher number of PCNA-reactive cells . The PCNA and Ki-67 labeling rates were closely correlated ( r = 0.383 , P = 0.009 ) . By flow cytometry , we observed a good correlation among PCNA labeling and S-phase fraction ( r = 0.422 , P = .0093 ) and G1 phase ( r = 0.303 , P = .051 ) of the cell cycle . Results indicate that PCNA labeling with PC10 is a simple method for assessing the proliferative activity in formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tissue of NSCLC and correlates well with Ki-67 labeling and S-phase fraction of the cell cycle .
Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) produced by phagocytic cells induce oxidative stress during chronic inflammation . ROS play a role in the pathogenesis of a broad range of diseases including autoimmune , cardiac and neoplastic abnormalities . We found that sera of patients with a variety of inflammatory dermatoses contain elevated levels of antibodies ( Ab ) binding to an oxidized DNA base derivative , 5-hydroxymethyl-2'deoxyuridine ( HMdU ) coupled to bovine serum albumin , as determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . Patients with immune complex diseases and a history of neoplasm elaborated the highest titers of anti-HMdU Ab . Titers from sera of psoriatic subjects were lower than from the aforementioned groups but were still significantly elevated ( p < 0.001 ) above those of healthy controls . Treatment of inflammatory dermatoses with systemic antiinflammatory and cytotoxic drugs significantly lowered the titers [ p < 0.005 ( immune complex ) or p < 0.001 ( psoriasis and neoplastic ) diseases ] , suggesting that this assay may be of value in monitoring the response to therapy in these diseases .
Lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) plays a central role in normal lipid metabolism as the key enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of triglycerides present in chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins . LPL is a member of a family of hydrolytic enzymes that include hepatic lipase and pancreatic lipase . Based on primary sequence homology of LPL to pancreatic lipase , Ser-132 , Asp-156 , and His-241 have been proposed to be part of a domain required for normal enzymic activity . We have analyzed the role of these potential catalytic residues by site-directed mutagenesis and expression of the mutant LPL in human embryonic kidney-293 cells . Substitution of Ser-132 , Asp-156 , and His-241 by several different residues resulted in the expression of an enzyme that lacked both triolein and tributyrin esterase activities . Mutation of other conserved residues , including Ser-97 , Ser-307 , Asp-78 , Asp-371 , Asp-440 , His-93 , and His-439 resulted in the expression of active enzymes . Despite their effect on LPL activity , substitutions of Ser-132 , Asp-156 , and His-241 did not change either the heparin affinity or lipid binding properties of the mutant LPL . In summary , mutation of Ser-132 , Asp-156 , and His-241 specifically abolishes total hydrolytic activity without disrupting other important functional domains of LPL . These combined results strongly support the conclusion that Ser-132 , Asp-156 , and His-241 form the catalytic triad of LPL and are essential for LPL hydrolytic activity .
Immunosuppression of immunoglobulin synthesis seen in patients with multiple myeloma is in part due to immunosuppressive CD5 positive B cells . In a 13 year longitudinal study of an IgA-deficient blood donor who developed multiple myeloma , the presence of immunosuppressive CD5 positive B cells and T cells preceded the diagnosis of overt multiple myeloma and the appearance of immunosuppressive monocytes . These data argue that certain immune defects may be involved in the development of myeloma and are not simply a consequence of overt malignancy .
Human diploid fibroblasts have a limited life span in vitro , and spontaneous immortalization is an extremely rare event . We have used transformation of human diploid fibroblasts by an origin-defective simian virus 40 genome to develop series of genetically matched immortal cell lines to analyze immortalization . Comparison of a preimmortal transformant ( SVtsA/HF-A ) with its uncloned and cloned immortalized derivatives ( AR5 and HAL ) has failed to reveal any major alteration involving the simian virus 40 genome . Karyotypic analysis , however , demonstrated that all of the immortal cell lines in this series have alterations of chromosome 6 involving loss of the portion distal to 6q21 . The karyotypic analysis was corroborated by DNA analyses . Southern analysis demonstrated that only one copy of three proto-oncogene loci ( ros1 , c-myb , and mas1 ) on 6q was retained in immortal cells . Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the microsatellite polymorphism at 6q22 ( D6S87 ) showed loss of heterozygosity . In addition , elevated expression of c-myb ( 6q22-23 ) was observed . We hypothesize that the region at and/or distal to 6q21 plays a role in immortalization , consistent with the presence of a growth suppressor gene .
The influence of cell shape on the expression of proto-oncogenes was examined in normal and malignant human cells that varied in their sensitivities to contact-inhibition of proliferation . Cells were constrained into varying degrees of roundness by plating onto culture surfaces coated with different concentrations of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate ) ( poly[HEMA] ) and assayed for proliferation capacity and levels of c-myc , c-ras , c-fos , and c-fes mRNAs . Proliferation of contact-inhibited normal CUA-1 fibroblasts and the variant HT-IFNr cells was highly coupled to cell shape . As these cells became more rounded , a critical degree of roundness was reached at which proliferation ceased . In contrast , proliferation of non-contact-inhibited malignant HT-1080 cells was independent of cell shape . Northern analysis revealed that expression of c-myc and c-ras was highly sensitive to cell shape in the normal CUA-1 cells but not in the malignant HT-1080 or variant HT-IFNr cells . Levels of c-myc and c-ras mRNAs declined to nearly undetectable levels in CUA-1 cells at degrees of roundness that correlated with loss of proliferative ability . Expression of c-fos and c-fes oncogenes were independent of cell shape in all cells tested . Quantification of transcription rates by the nuclear run-off assay showed that shape modulation of c-myc and c-ras oncogene expression occurred at the transcriptional level . These data suggest that changes in cell shape can modulate expression of certain oncogenes and that these changes correlate with the cell's ability to proliferate . Moreover , inability to regulate c-myc and c-ras oncogene expression is associated with loss of shape-dependent growth controls and contact inhibition but that loss of this regulation alone is not sufficient to release cells from contact-inhibited controls .
Despite an increasing incidence of human breast cancer , its etiology remains unknown . Since some environmental chemicals are stored in human breast fat and are rodent mammary carcinogens , determining the genotoxic potential of environmental agents in this key target tissue is important . An assay was developed for detecting genotoxic activity , as unscheduled DNA synthesis ( UDS ) , induced by chemicals and UV radiation in early passage cultures of normal human mammary epithelial cells ( HMEC ) derived from 5 different women . In order to measure UDS in culture , reduction in the percentage of cells in S-phase was accomplished either by depriving the cells of epidermal growth factor and bovine pituitary extract or by contact inhibition of growth . Cultures were incubated with test chemicals for 24 h in the presence of [ 3H]-thymidine . UDS was quantitated autoradiographically as net grains per nucleus ( nuclear grains minus cytoplasmic background , population average ) with > or = 6 net nuclear grains considered in repair for any individual cell . A positive response was observed with UV radiation , benzo(a)-pyrene , aflatoxin B1 , ethylmethanesulfonate , 1,6-dinitropyrene , 2-acetylaminofluorene , and tobacco smoke condensate but not 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin . These results demonstrate that HMEC from all 5 women examined have the ability to metabolize a variety of environmental chemicals to DNA-reactive forms . Furthermore , some chemicals known either to cause mammary cancer in rodents or to be contaminants in human breast tissue are genotoxic in HMEC . A positive response in passage 9 cultures was observed only with direct acting agents , suggesting that HMEC may lose their metabolic capabilities in longer-term cultures . The HMEC UDS assay may be used to address the role of environmental agents in human breast cancer by determining whether chemicals are DNA reactive or metabolized to DNA reactive species in this critical target tissue .
Since tumor cells are more dependent on glycolysis for energy supply than other cells , we tested whether its inhibition by 2-deoxy-D-glucose ( 2-DG ) affects tumor growth . Male Wistar rats were inoculated in the liver with tumor cells from a chemically induced colonic adenocarcinoma . From day 5 after inoculation 2-DG ( 400 mg/kg/24 h ) was continuously infused into the hepatic artery for 5 days ; controls received saline in the same fashion . Seven days after the end of infusion , the animals were sacrificed . A second experimental group of rats was treated with isolated liver perfusion for 30 min with oxygenated blood through the portal vein and hepatic artery simultaneously . In the perfusate , 400 mg/kg 2-DG were added , and the rats were sacrificed at 10 days after perfusion . A first control group underwent perfusion without 2-DG , and a second control group received i.v. infusion of 2-DG ( 400 mg/kg/30 min ) for 30 min over 5 days . A nontreated control group was also added . All animals survived the procedures . The concentration of blood glucose increased in the rats receiving 2-DG i.v. and intraarterially but was unchanged in the other groups . The tumor growth was significantly reduced by 2-DG in all experimental groups , with no difference between the groups . It is therefore concluded that 2-DG is of potential interest in the treatment of malignancies . Since local application of 2-DG avoids the risk for systemic side effects , this approach should be explored further .
DNA single-strand breaks and associated growth inhibition induced by the thymidylate synthase inhibitor N-(5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazoline-6-ylmethyl)-N -methylamino]-2 - thenoyl)-L-glutamic acid ( ICI D1694 ) were quantitated using the human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cell line , HCT-8 . The effects of different concentrations and schedules of [ 6R,S]-5-formyltetrahydrofolate ( [ 6RS]LV ) and 2'-deoxy-thymidine ( dThd ) on drug growth inhibition and DNA damage were also evaluated . The drug concentrations for 50% inhibition of cell growth in culture following 2-h and 72-h exposures were 0.073 and 0.003 microM , respectively . After a 2-h drug exposure , the occurrence of DNA single-strand breaks ( SSBs ) was time dependent . It was detectable at 8 h and reached a maximum at about 24 h , 34 +/- 3 ( SD ) and 305 +/- 34 rad equivalents with 0.1 microM ( 50% inhibition concentration ) and 1.0 microM ( 90% inhibition concentration ) ICI D1694 , respectively . A significant level of DNA SSBs ( 101 +/- 13 rad equivalents ) was still detectable at 72 h after the 2-h treatment with 1 microM ICI D1694 . No significant level of DNA SSBs was detected when cells were exposed simultaneously to ICI D1694 and 20 microM [ 6RS]LV . Complete rescue of drug-induced DNA SSBs could be achieved when cells were exposed to 10 microM dThd starting no later than 4 h after drug treatment . The growth inhibition of ICI D1694 was abrogated by [ 6RS]LV in a concentration-dependent manner . Complete protection was achieved when cells were exposed simultaneously to 1 microM ICI D1694 and 5 microMs [ 6RS]LV or to 3 microMs dThd immediately after drug treatment . The results demonstrate that : ( a ) the growth inhibition of ICI D1694 is a function of time and schedule ; ( b ) the growth inhibition is accompanied by extensive DNA single-strand breaks and slow repair ; ( c ) at 1 microM ICI D1694 , 3 microMs dThd and 5 microMs [ 6RS]LV can completely rescue cells from drug effects when dThd is added up to 4 h following drug treatment or when [ 6RS]LV is given in combination with the drug ; ( d ) interference of [ 6RS]LV with ICI D1694 action may be occurring at the level of drug uptake and at intracellular targets , while dThd interferes with the drug action at intracellular targets .
Adhesion molecules play an important role in the functioning of the immune system , particularly with regard to cell-cell interactions and antigen presentation . Several adhesion molecules are expressed on Hodgkin's disease-derived cell lines and these are important in their molecular interactions as antigen presenting cells ( APC ) . There are no data regarding the expression of many of these adhesion molecules on Reed-Sternberg cells and its mononuclear variant ( Hodgkin's cells ( HC) ) present in pathological material . To obtain this information we undertook an immunohistological study on material from 18 cases of Hodgkin's disease using a panel of MoAbs to examine the expression of adhesion molecules on HC . The HC were shown to express the integrin beta 1 subfamily molecules , LFA-1 ( CD11a ) and p150,95 ( CD11c ) in high density but lacked CR3 ( CD11b ) . All of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily adhesion molecules studied were present to some degree on HC , with ICAM-2 , in particular , showing moderate to strong expression in most cases . The Hermes antigen CD44 was present in high density but leukosialin ( CD43 ) , another molecule present on diverse leucocyte types , was , in general , not detected on HC . These new data showing that ICAM-1 , ICAM-2 and LFA-3 are , like LFA-1 , expressed on HC emphasize the ability of HC to act as APC . The known adhesion molecule phenotype of the recently defined haematopoietic lineage of human dendritic cells ( DC ) is broadly similar to that of HC , perhaps supporting the hypothesis that some HC represent a malignancy of an APC ( DC ) lineage .
To elucidate the mechanism of the synergistic cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) ( CDDP ) , we studied the interaction of these agents using a human squamous carcinoma cell line ( HST-1 ) . Exposure to 5-FU for 24 h and to CDDP for 1 h produced a 50% inhibitory concentration of 1.0 micrograms/ml ( 7.7 microM ) and 2.5 micrograms/ml ( 8.3 microM ) , respectively . The cytotoxic action of CDDP was augmented , and a greater than additive effect was observed when the cells were exposed to 5-FU ( 1.0 micrograms/ml ; 7.7 microM ) for 24 h before the CDDP treatment . This synergistic activity was maximal when the interval between 5-FU and CDDP exceeded 24 h . In contrast , the cytotoxicity of CDDP was attenuated when it preceded the exposure to 5-FU . Thymidine did not alter the 5-FU-CDDP interaction . Evaluation of the kinetics of the removal of DNA interstrand cross-links , measured by alkaline elution , showed a significant reduction of this removal in the cells exposed to 5-FU followed by CDDP with a drug-free interval of 48 h , as compared with cells exposed to CDDP alone , or to 5-FU immediately followed by CDDP , although no differences were found in the formation of DNA interstrand cross-links by CDDP among these cells . No significant differences in the accumulation of intracellular platinum were detected by atomic absorption spectrophotometry . These findings suggest that 5-FU modulates the repair of platinum-DNA adducts , thereby potentiating the antitumor activity of CDDP .
The effect of quercetin , a flavonoid found in many plants , on the proliferation of human leukemic T-cells was analyzed . Quercetin reversibly blocked the cell cycle at a point 3-6 h before the start of DNA synthesis . Expression of the growth-related genes histone H4 , cyclin A and B , and p34cdc2 was suppressed in cells blocked with quercetin . Comparison of the quercetin arrest points with those of the cell cycle inhibitors aphidicolin and mimosine revealed a temporal order of arrest points in G1 of quercetin , mimosine , and aphidicolin . Mimosine and aphidicolin did not inhibit the expression of cyclin A or p34cdc2 , whereas all three reagents inhibited expression of cyclin B. Low concentrations of the protein inhibitor cycloheximide inhibited release of the quercetin but not the mimosine or aphidicolin block . A [ 35S]methionine-labeled M(r) 60,000 protein disappeared in quercetin-treated cells and was rapidly synthesized after removal of quercetin , suggesting the possibility that the M(r) 60,000 protein induces DNA synthesis after the cell is released from a quercetin block . These results suggest the usefulness of quercetin in studies of the regulation of late G1 phase .
Previous studies have demonstrated that the tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone ( NNK ) induced liver tumors in F344 rats but not in Syrian golden hamsters . The aim of this study was to determine whether there was a correlation between the persistence of O6-methylguanine ( O6-mGua ) adducts and the rate of recovery of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( O6-mGuaT ) after depletion in the liver and susceptibility to NNK in F344 rat and Syrian golden hamster injected s.c. with NNK ( 80 mg/kg ) . The levels of both 7-methylguanine and O6-mGua reached a maximum 24 h after NNK treatment . O6-mGua in NNK-treated rat liver was undetectable after 48 h . In the rat , the depletion of O6-mGuaT activity occurred within 4 h following NNK treatment . A subsequent rapid recovery of enzyme activity was observed 36 h after NNK exposure . In contrast , high levels of O6-mGua persisted in hamster liver DNA and no O6-mGuaT activity was detected up to 336 h after NNK injection . Thus , the persistence of O6-mGua in hamster liver is most likely related to a lack of recovery of the O6-mGuaT . These results suggested that factors other than O6-mGua may be determining NNK-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats . An aldehyde generated by alpha-hydroxylation of NNK , 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butanal , inhibited O6-mGuaT activity in rat hepatocytes , suggesting that this aldehyde contributes to the carcinogenicity of NNK by inhibiting this repair enzyme .
The aim of this study was to address whether there is a fundamental difference in regulation of histone gene expression in cells that have become quiescent but retain the ability to proliferate , compared with those cells that have differentiated . We compared multiple levels of regulation of histone gene expression during 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte differentiation . Confluent cells induced to differentiate by treatment with insulin , dexamethasone , and isobutylmethylxanthine initially exhibited an increased proliferative response compared with cells given serum alone . This initial differentiation response was associated with a twofold increase in both histone gene transcription and cellular histone mRNA levels , as well as with enhanced sequence-specific binding of nuclear factors to the proximal cell-cycle-regulatory element of the H4 histone promoter . Transforming growth factor beta 1 , an inhibitor of 3T3-L1 differentiation , increased both the percentage of proliferating cells and the cellular levels of histone mRNA when given in addition to serum stimulation , but no enhancement of these parameters was observed upon addition of TGF beta 1 to the differentiation treatment . Interestingly , although TGF beta 1 enhanced binding of nuclear factors to the proximal cell cycle regulatory element of the histone promoter , these protein/DNA interactions were not associated with an increase in histone transcription . Our results are consistent with the down-regulation of histone gene expression at confluency being controlled primarily at the post-transcriptional level , in contrast to an increased involvement of transcriptional down-regulation at the onset of differentiation .
At present , isoniazid ( INH ) is being used prophylactically to reduce the side effects of intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder cancer , although it is not clear whether or not this reduces the antitumor efficacy of BCG . In this study the impact of INH treatment on the immune response after repeated intravesical BCG administration was investigated in guinea pigs . INH was given on the 3 days around each BCG instillation . We found that the administration of INH severely impaired the immunological effects of BCG . The induction of mononuclear cell infiltration in the bladder wall was reduced . Enlargement of the regional lymph nodes ( weight and number of cells ) , and increase of MHC Class II expression on the lymph node cells , normally observed after intravesical BCG administration , were inhibited by INH . Systemic immunity , measured by the DTH reaction in the skin to PPD , was also diminished due to the combined treatment of BCG with INH . When INH was administered during the last 4 of 6 BCG instillations , the immune response to BCG was still impaired . A five-fold increase of the dose of BCG did not overcome the effect of INH . INH probably did not exert a direct suppression of the immune system of the guinea pig as the DNCB skin reactivity was not influenced . Although INH concentrations in the urine were high at the onset of the instillation , in vitro experiments indicated that the effect of INH may not be caused by killing of the BCG organisms shortly after application in the bladder . In conclusion , our data in guinea pigs suggest that the use of INH may impair the immune response to intravesical BCG . As this response may be important for the antitumor effect of BCG , urologists should be cautious with the prophylactic use of INH . The influence on the antitumor efficacy is now investigated in man .
Between 1965 and 1985 , 489 patients with advanced gastric cancer who were treated with gastric resection and in whom tumor cells remained after the operation were defined as cases of a " noncurative resection. " The clinicopathological features and prognosis of these patients were examined and two groups were prepared : locally advanced cancer and cancer with a distant metastasis . In locally advanced cancer cases , tumor cells remained in the neighboring organs , lymph nodes , and/or resected margins ; in those with distant metastasis , peritoneal dissemination and/or liver metastasis were present regardless of whether or not the metastasis was removed , with or without locally noncurative factors . Serosal invasion was prominent and high rates of lymph node metastasis and lymphatic involvement were evident in both groups . The survival rate for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer was better than that of patients with distant metastasis ( P < 0.01 ) . Survival time in patients with locally advanced cancer can be lengthened by resecting all of the primary tumor and as much of the metastatic lesions as possible , even if the surgical management is " noncurative. " Aggressive postoperative chemotherapy for patients with distant metastasis from a gastric cancer is to be recommended .
Histopathological features of the lymph node involvement were studied in 104 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer who underwent subtotal esophagectomy combined with extended radical lymph adenectomy in cervicothoracoabdominal region . Metastatic involvement was found in a total number of 503 lymph nodes from 73 patients by histologic examination . The mean of long and short diameter was found to be less than 5mm in 125 ( 24.9% ) of these 503 nodes . The involved area on the section was less than one third in 149 nodes ( 29.6% ) , and was significantly smaller in mediastinal lymph nodes than those in cervical or abdominal ones . Sixty-seven ( 13.3% ) of 503 nodes were partially invaded by micrometastasis of 1mm or less in diameter . Micrometastasis also more frequently occurred in mediastinal nodes with a statistically significant difference . Extranodal proliferation ( ENP ) of cancer cells was found in 106 nodes ( 21.1% ) , and extranodal lymphatic and/or blood vessel invasion ( ENly , v ) was also recognized in 60 nodes ( 11.9% ) . Micrometastasis and ENP with or without ENly , v were found in 24 ( 32.9% ) and 29 ( 39.7% ) of 73 patients with positive lymph node metastasis , respectively . Postoperative survival rate in patients with micrometastasis and/or ENP with or without ENly , v was inferior to that in patients with neither of them .
The cytotoxic activity of cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and the three non-immuno-suppressive CsA analogues B3-243 , WO-039 and B3-665 were studied in tumor cell lines representing both classical and atypical forms of multidrug resistance ( MDR ) : T-ALL GM3639 L100 cells selected for vincristine ( vcr ) resistance and displaying characteristics of classical MDR , including P-glycoprotein ( pgp ) expression and increased drug efflux which can be inhibited by pgp blockers ( e.g. verapamil ) , and U-1285/ADR , a small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) cell line selected for doxorubicin resistance which lacks pgp , is insensitive to pgp-blockers and shows cross resistance to cis-platinum . At 1 micrograms/ml CsA was the most active agent in reversing Vcr resistance in L100 cells followed by B3-243 and WO-039 , with no effect of B3-665 . Parental LO cells were only marginally sensitized to Vcr by these agents . No reversing effect of any cyclosporin was observed in the U-1285/ADR or its parental cell line . Compared to LO cells , L100 cells showed a marked hypersensitivity to CsA > B3-243 > WO-039 with B3-665 being inactive . No collateral sensitivity was observed for cyclosporins in U-1285/ADR cells . Although of different magnitude , the pattern of cytotoxic activity for the different cyclosporins alone closely parallelled that of L100 cells for U-1285 , U1285/ADR and LO cells . The results indicate that not only the collateral sensitivity in classical MDR but also the cytotoxic actions of cyclosporins per se on tumor cells alone are independent of immunosuppressive activity . The results also suggest a structure-activity relationship for cyclosporin-induced cytotoxicity similar to , but independent of , MDR reversing activity .
The effect of transforming growth factor-beta 1 ( TGF-beta 1 ) and interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1 beta ) on LDL receptor in Hep G2 cells was investigated . A greater than two-fold stimulation of the binding and internalisation of [ 125I]-labelled LDL at 37 degrees C was observed after an 18-h incubation of the cells with TGF-beta 1 at 50 ng/ml and IL-1 beta at 11,700 units/ml compared with control cells . Scatchard analysis of the binding of [ 125I]-labelled LDL at 4 degrees C after an 18-h incubation of the cells with 1170 units/ml IL-1 beta and 5 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 showed that they were both acting primarily by increasing LDL receptor number . The increase in LDL receptor activity could not be attributed to an increase in cell proliferation as TGF-beta 1 at concentrations from 0.05 ng/ml to 50 ng/ml had no significant effect on either cell number or [ 3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA whilst IL-1 beta inhibited DNA synthesis by more than 80% at a concentration of 11,700 units/ml but had significant effect on cell number . Cholesterol biosynthesis from [ 14C]acetate , in contrast to the stimulation of LDL receptor activity , was inhibited by approximately two-fold by incubation with TGF-beta 1 at 50 ng/ml and IL-1 beta at 11,700 units/ml .
MCF-7 human breast cancer cells propagated in vitro were treated with adenosine derivatives added to the culture medium . The effects on cell proliferation , glycolysis , and glutaminolysis were investigated . Of all adenosine derivatives tested , AMP was the most efficient inhibitor of cell proliferation . In AMP-treated cells , DNA synthesis decreased , whereas RNA and protein syntheses rose normally with time . In terms of carbohydrate metabolism , lactate production from glucose was drastically reduced ; therefore , most of lactate produced must have been derived from glutamine . Increases in the enzyme activities involved in glutamate degradation and in the malate-aspartate shuttle were observed . In contrast , actual glycolytic flux rates declined , whereas key glycolytic enzyme activities increased . Metabolites such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and pyruvate accumulated in AMP-arrested cells . Based on the lowered NAD level in the AMP-treated cells , lactate dehydrogenase , but not malate dehydrogenase , was impaired ; thereby the whole of glycolysis was inhibited . In compensation , glutamine catabolism was increased . NAD concentrations fell drastically because of the known inhibition of P-ribose-PP synthesis through heightened intracellular AMP levels . A hypothetical metabolic scheme to explain these results and to show how extracellular AMP may influence carbohydrate metabolism and cell proliferation is presented .
Intracellular pH ( pHi ) plays a critical role in the entry of cells into the DNA-synthesis phase of the cell cycle . Alterations in pHi may contribute to abnormal proliferative responses such as those seen in tumorigenic cells . We observed that alkaline stress leads to genomic transformation of Madin-Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells . Transformed cells ( F cells ) form " foci " in culture , lack contact inhibition , and are able to migrate , typical characteristics of dedifferentiated tumorigenic cells . F cells exhibit spontaneous biorhythmicity . Rhythmic transmembrane Ca2+ flux activates plasma membrane K+ channels and Na+/H+ exchange . This leads to periodic changes of membrane voltage and pHi at about one cycle per minute . We conclude that endogenous oscillatory activity could be a trigger mechanism for DNA synthesis , proliferation , and abnormal growth of renal epithelial cells in culture .
BACKGROUND Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) are a gene family of zinc enzymes capable of degrading almost all of the extracellular matrix macromolecules in vivo . Their enzymic activities are believed to be responsible for tumor invasion and metastasis . METHODS In this study , using peroxidase-antiperoxidase method , monospecific antisera against MMP-1 ( tissue collagenase ) , MMP-2 ( type IV collagenase/72-kilodalton [ KD ] gelatinase ) , and MMP-3 ( stromelysin ) were applied to 29 squamous cell carcinomas and normal epithelium of the esophagus to identify cells synthesizing and secreting these enzymes . RESULTS Immunoreactivity of MMP-1 , -2 , and -3 was observed in small cancer nests of the deeply invasive or marginal portion of the tumor . Among the 29 patients studied , the presence of at least one MMP was observed in 17 ( 58.6% ) . All three enzymes were observed in six ( 20.6% ) patients , MMP-2 and -3 in five ( 17.2% ) patients , only MMP-2 in three ( 10.3% ) patients , and MMP-3 alone in three ( 10.3% ) patients . There was a good correlation among histologic stage and tumor invasion , lymph node metastasis , and MMP expression . In particular , expression of MMP-2 and -3 was closely related to lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion . CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that MMP , especially MMP-2 and -3 , play an important role in tumor invasion and metastasis and that analysis of MMP-2 and -3 production is useful for evaluation of malignant potential in esophageal carcinoma .
Urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( u-PA ) plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis . The aim of this work was to study the u-PA production , in vitro and in vivo , in a transplantable murine mammary adenocarcinoma ( M3 ) , moderately metastatic to lung , and in a related tumor variant ( MM3 ) , highly metastatic to the same organ , during tumor development . At different times post-transplantation , tumors were employed to prepare either primary cell cultures or homogenates . PA activity from conditioned media ( CM ) , cell lysates ( CLs ) and tumor homogenates ( THs ) was quantitated by means of a fibrinolytic assay . Immunoneutralization and zymographic assays were performed to identify the PA present in both tumors . PA activity in CM , CLs and THs , that was undetectable at early stages , increased significantly along the growth of M3 adenocarcinoma . Secreted PA activity in MM3 CM was measurable at early stages and consistently increased up to 37 days post-transplantation , but a marked fall of activity was found at 48 days . PA activity in MM3 THs exhibited the same enhancement and late fall found in vitro . A positive correlation was observed between tumor size and THs PA values in both tumors . The PA present in cell cultures and THs was identified as of the u-PA type . These results support the hypothesis that high u-PA levels are important for tumor invasion and that the stage of tumor development is a critical factor in their PA activity .
Fifty-six previously untreated stage-I ( according to Rai ) chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) patients were examined for their clinical data , immunological characteristics , and hormonal values . Dysfunction of T and B lymphocytes was demonstrated by changed lymphocyte blastogenic response to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) , concanavalin A ( ConA ) , pisum sativatum agglutinin ( PSA ) , wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) , recombinant interleukin 2 ( IL 2 ) , and dextran sulfate ( DxS ) ; also by decreased immunoglobulin levels ( IgG , IgA , IgE ) and increased beta 2-microglobulin ( beta 2-M ) values . Simultaneously , dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis , immune system integration , imbalance of sex hormones , and changes in thyroid hormones were observed in the same group of patients . Disturbed immunohormonal interactions in early-stage CLL may be responsible for the pathogenetic mechanisms in this lymphoproliferative malignancy .
The growth-inhibitory effects of ketoconazole , an antifungal agent which inhibits arachidonic acid lipoxygenases and cytochrome P-450 enzymes , were tested in human colon and breast cancer cell lines . In the serum independent HT29-S-B6 colon cell clone , ketoconazole reduced cell proliferation and [ 3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent fashion , with a 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 2.5 microM . Flow cytometry showed an accumulation of cells in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle and a concomitant decrease of the percentage of cells in S phase . Ketoconazole also inhibited [ 3H]thymidine incorporation in the hormone-independent breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and Evsa-T , with respective 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 13 and 2 microM . The mechanism of action of ketoconazole is unknown . However , another lipoxygenase inhibitor , BW755C , inhibited only weakly [ 3H]-thymidine incorporation and accumulated the cells in S and G2 . Conversely , clotrimazole and SKF525A , inhibitors of cytochrome P-450 enzymes , had effects similar to those of ketoconazole on HT29-S-B6 cells whereas metronidazole and secnidazole , other azole derivatives which do not inhibit cytochrome P-450 enzymes , had no effect . The results suggest that cytochrome P-450 enzyme(s) activity(ies) could be implicated in the antiproliferative effects of ketoconazole .
We found that the human colon cancer cell line SW480 consists of two distinct subpopulations which we have designated E-type ( epithelial ) and R-type ( round ) . Pure cultures of each type were obtained by subcloning , and both have maintained their characteristic phenotypes for at least 1 year ( 40 passages ) . E-type cells are the major ( > 98% ) type in the parental SW480 cell line . They form flat epithelial-like colonies . In contrast , R-type cells , which constitute a minor fraction ( < 2% ) of the parental cell line , have a rounded shape and grow in clusters of piled-up cells . Compared to E-type cells or the parental SW480 cells , isolated R-type cells display decreased doubling time , loss of contact inhibition , less adhesiveness to culture plates , higher anchorage-independent growth in soft agar , and a much more aneuploid karyotype . When injected s.c. into nude mice , R-type cells produce much larger tumors within the same period of time than E-type cells , and the tumors are less differentiated than those produced by the E-type cells . Cell fusion experiments between R-type and E-type cells revealed that the R-type phenotype is dominant , and the results suggest that this is due to one or a few genetic changes . Taken together , these findings suggest that the R-type cells represent a more malignant variant of the E-type cells . They may be useful , therefore , for studying mechanisms involved in tumor progression .
Many reports have emphasized the role of gastrin as a growth factor for normal gastrointestinal mucosa and gastrointestinal cancers . Recent studies have pointed out that this peptide acts also as a growth factor for the pancreatic cancer cell line AR42J . This effect is mediated by gastrin [ cholecystokinin ( CCK)-B ] receptors . In the present study , we investigated gastrin ( CCK-B ) receptor expression in the azaserine-induced rat pancreatic carcinoma DSL-6 , comparing it to normal rat pancreas , and we also characterized CCK receptor subtypes in this tumor . The results showed that there is extensive gastrin binding to the DSL-6 pancreatic carcinoma . No evidence of specific gastrin binding to normal pancreas was found . Analysis of the ability of gastrin-17-I to inhibit 125I-gastrin-I binding demonstrated that gastrin bound to a single class of receptors with a Kd of 0.21 +/- 0.04 nM and a binding capacity of 184 +/- 29 fmol/mg protein. 125I-Gastrin-I binding was inhibited by the specific CCK-B receptor antagonist L365,260 approximately 40 times more effectively than by the specific CCK-A receptor antagonist L364,718 . Analysis of the ability of cholecystokinin octapeptide ( CCK-8 ) to inhibit 125I-Bolton-Hunter-CCK-8 binding revealed two CCK binding sites , i.e. , a high affinity site and a low affinity site . The observed binding affinities of CCK-8 were then introduced into the computer analysis of the dose-inhibition curve of the ability of gastrin-17-I to inhibit binding of 125I-Bolton-Hunter-CCK-8 , which was significantly better fit by a three-site model than by a two-site model . The three sites meet the criteria for CCK-B , high affinity CCK-A , and low affinity CCK-A receptors . The binding capacity of CCK-B receptors constitutes 34% of the total high affinity CCK binding sites . This study demonstrated that DSL-6 pancreatic carcinoma expresses three subtypes of CCK receptors . Gastrin ( CCK-B ) receptors , which were not detected in normal rat pancreas , constitute about one third of the total high affinity CCK receptors . We suggest that novel expression of gastrin ( CCK-B ) receptors may be generated by gene mutation or amplification during carcinogenesis and may play an important role in promoting tumor growth .
We analyzed several factors which could influence the immunogenicity of colon tumor cells , using a series of clones derived from a single chemically induced rat adenocarcinoma cell line . These clones display variable tumorigenic potential in syngeneic immunocompetent animals , and it has been established that in this model the tumorigenicity of the cells depends on their ability to escape immune surveillance . The results show an absence of relationship between tumorigenicity and expression of MHC-class-I antigens , cell adhesion to rat fibroblasts or fibroblast extracellular matrix . The secretion of latent and active TGF beta I appeared to be quite variable from one clone to the other , but was unrelated to tumorigenicity . Unexpectedly , some regressive clones produced elevated levels of this cytokine , suggesting that in this model , spontaneous secretion of TGF beta I is not sufficient to impair the immune system of the host . In contrast , the more tumorigenic clones were more resistant than less tumorigenic ones to cytotoxicity mediated by NK or LAK cells . They also showed arrest of cell proliferation after reaching confluence , something not observed in the less tumorigenic clones . Finally , the strongest relationship with tumorigenicity was found for expression of blood-group carbohydrate antigens . Increased expression of blood-group-H antigen and , conversely , decreased expression of beta-galactoside precursors of this antigen correlated with increased tumorigenicity .
Hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) , a mesenchymal-derived factor which regulates growth , motility , and morphogenesis of epithelial and endothelial cells , functions as a hepatotrophic and renotrophic factor for regeneration of the liver and kidney . We have now obtained evidence that transforming growth factor-beta 1 ( TGF-beta 1 ) and glucocorticoids are negative regulators for HGF gene expression . When TGF-beta 1 or dexamethasone was added to cultures of MRC-5 human embryonic lung fibroblasts and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemic cells , the amount of HGF secreted into the culture medium was inhibited to 30-40% of that of control cultures by 10 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 and to 40-50% by 10(-6) M dexamethasone . The inhibitory effect of TGF-beta 1 and dexamethasone on HGF synthesis in MRC-5 cells was additive , thereby suggesting that TGF-beta 1 and dexamethasone exert effects through distinct mechanisms . Hydrocortisone also inhibited HGF synthesis with the same potency as dexamethasone ; however , testosterone , estriol , and beta-estradiol had no effect . The rate of HGF synthesis in MRC-5 cells , as measured by pulse labeling with [ 35S]methionine and subsequent immunoprecipitation , was suppressed to 30-40% of the control with 10 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 , and to 30-45% by 10(-6) M dexamethasone . HGF mRNA levels in MRC-5 cells and HL-60 cells were dose-dependently suppressed by TGF-beta 1 and dexamethasone ; 10 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 suppressed HGF mRNA levels to 32% and 35% of control culture , respectively , in MRC-5 cells and HL-60 cells , and 10(-6) M dexamethasone suppressed to 43% and 38% , respectively . Thus , TGF-beta 1 and glucocorticoids seem to inhibit HGF synthesis by suppressing the expression of the HGF gene . We propose that a negative regulation of HGF gene expression by TGF-beta 1 or glucocorticoids may be involved in physiological or pathological processes during tissue regeneration .
Peptide 11 , CDPGYIGSR-NH2 , is a segment of laminin which blocks tumor cell invasion . A high affinity laminin receptor in tumor cells is thought to be blocked by the carboxyl-terminal YIGSR , and conformational energy calculations suggest that the glycine in YIGSR allows an important conformational bend . We replaced the YIGSR glycine residue in peptide 11 with either D-alanine or L-alanine to allow or disfavor the proposed glycine bend . We found the Gly7-->D-Ala7 analog to be equal to peptide 11 in inhibiting tumor cell invasion of basement membrane matrix . The Gly7-->L-Ala7 analog was much less capable of invasion inhibition . Two-dimensional 1H-1H NMR was used to study the solution conformations of the peptide 11 analogs . NOESY experiments revealed close NH-NH contacts in peptide 11 and the D-Ala7 analog , but not in the L-Ala7 analog . Molecular dynamics generated low energy structures with excellent NOE agreement for peptide 11 and its analogs . Both peptide 11 and the D-Ala7 analog , but not the less active L-Ala7 analog , were predicted to have similar bends around Gly7 or D-Ala7 . These results suggest that a bend in the YIGSR region of peptide 11 may be important for the binding of laminin to its metastasis-associated receptor .
Cytokines are known to play an important role in host defense by regulating the function , growth , and differentiation of the cells of the immune system . We hypothesize that , in the tumor microenvironment , tumor cells and resident tissue cells ( e.g. , fibroblasts ) also produce cytokines that may regulate the local immune response to tumors . Initially , homogenates of eight head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( HNSCC ) were assayed for the presence of interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) to establish the presence of these cytokines in the tumors in vivo . We detected IL-1 in all tumor homogenates and IL-4 , IL-6 , and GM-CSF in some homogenates . To assess the ability of HNSCC to produce these cytokines , supernatants of short-term primary cultures of HNSCC were assayed for the same cytokines . No IL-1 was detected , although baseline levels of IL-4 , IL-6 , and GM-CSF were present . However , the stimulation of primary tumor cultures with exogenous IL-1 induced or significantly enhanced production of IL-4 ( p < 0.01 ) , IL-6 ( p < 0.001 ) , and GM-CSF ( p < 0.02 ) . These results support our hypothesis that HNSCC secrete cytokines that may influence the response of local immune cells . Our data also suggest that IL-1 may have a central role in regulating the local immune response through the enhancement or induction of cytokine production by tumor and/or resident tissue cells .
The high affinity fibronectin receptor ( FNR ) is expressed by hematopoietic cells , fibroblasts , and proliferating epidermal cells . Expression of this integrin is altered by chemical and viral transformation , suggesting that FNR dysfunction may play a role in growth control . This study demonstrates that exposing FA-K562 cells to glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartate-serine ( GRGDS ) , a peptide ligand of the FNR , specifically stimulates p34/cdc2- and cyclin A-associated kinase activities . This occurs within 2 h of peptide addition . The 110-kDa form of the retinoblastoma protein appears within 3 h of GRGDS addition , consistent with activation of a G1/S kinase . DNA staining profiles demonstrate that GRGDS induces cell cycle progression within 24 h . Increased anchorage-independent growth is subsequently observed in GRGDS-treated FA-K562 cells . The control peptide , GRGES , which cannot bind the FNR , has none of these effects . This demonstrates that an extracellular integrin ligand can regulate cell proliferation . Furthermore , these results suggest that integrins link the extracellular environment and intracellular growth regulators .
Capillary endothelial cells can be induced to form capillary-like structures in vitro by plating on fibronectin-coated dishes ( Ingber , D. E. , and Folkman , J . ( 1989 ) J. Cell Biol. 109 , 317-330 ) , thereby mimicking angiogenesis . To assess the role of glycoproteins bearing asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in this process , we tested the effect of oligosaccharide processing inhibitors on the formation of capillary tubes . Deoxymannojirimycin , a compound that prevents synthesis of hybrid and complex-type oligosaccharides , inhibited the formation of capillary tubes . In contrast , swainsonine , an inhibitor that blocks synthesis of complex- but not hybrid-type oligosaccharides , did not inhibit tube formation . Lectin affinity chromatography of 2-[3H] mannose-labeled glycopeptides from endothelial cells induced to form tubes did not reveal a striking difference in the spectrum of oligosaccharides compared to uninduced cells . Since endothelial cells formed tubes normally in the presence of swainsonine , we analyzed glycopeptides from swainsonine-treated induced and uninduced cells . Cells induced to form tubes were enriched in monosialylated hybrid-type oligosaccharides sensitive to alpha-fucosidase , beta-galactosidase , and beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase , suggestive of sialyl Lewis-X determinants . We used an enzyme-linked immunoassay to measure sialyl Lewis-X epitopes on capillary endothelial cells and found that both induced and uninduced cells expressed sialyl Lewis-X epitopes . Deoxymannojirimycin and , to a lesser extent , swainsonine reduced the level of sialyl Lewis-X epitopes in cells induced to form capillary tubes , but neither compound affected the level of epitopes in cell monolayers . We conclude that synthesis of at least hybrid-type oligosaccharides is required for capillary tube formation in vitro and that an increase in monosialylated , fucosylated glycans on asparagine-linked oligosaccharides occurs during this process .
The UT-7 cell line was established from a patient with a megakaryoblastic leukemia ( Komatsu et al , Cancer Res 51 : 341 , 1991 ) . Its proliferation is strictly dependent on the presence of hematopoietic growth factors including erythropoietin ( Epo ) , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , and interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) . We investigated the differentiation capacities of this cell line under the action of several growth factors , using immunomarkers , flow cytometry , and ultrastructural techniques . In the presence of GM-CSF and IL-3 , eosinophil and basophil promyelocytes were detected , as well as a few cells with erythroid and megakaryocytic ( MK ) differentiation features . In contrast , Epo induced a marked erythroid differentiation with an increase of glycophorin A expression , accompanied by a few hemoglobinized cells . Differentiation induced by the growth factors took 24 to 48 hours to begin , and increased with cell passages to a plateau at 2 weeks of culture . However , this was not only due to a cell selection because the differential effects of Epo and GM-CSF were observed from a single cell clone and the phenotype could be reversed by opposite growth factors , even after a long period of culture . We subsequently investigated the phenotype of UT-7 in the presence of combinations of Epo , IL-3 , and GM-CSF , and showed that GM-CSF and IL-3 act predominantly over Epo . This effect was mediated by a rapid downmodulation of Epo receptors by GM-CSF at messenger RNA and binding sites levels , without a change in receptor affinities . On the other hand , Epo had no effect on number and affinity of GM-CSF receptors . This study shows that UT-7 is a growth factor-dependent pluripotent cell line in which commitment may be directed by a hierarchical action of growth factors through an early and rapid transmodulation of growth factor receptors .
Transforming growth factor-Beta ( TGF-beta ) is a potent growth inhibitor for several cell types including epithelial cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells . Using a human promonocytic leukemia cell line , THP-1 , we have shown that TGF-beta inhibits their proliferation and promotes differentiation into cells exhibiting macrophage-like properties . Therefore , a key question is whether TGF-beta influences the expression of genes associated with proliferation and/or growth inhibition . TGF-beta treatment of THP-1 cells results in downregulation of expression of c-myc . We also observe that TGF-beta 1-treated cells express reduced levels of the cell cycle regulated histone , H2B , but express elevated levels of an RNA splicing variant of this histone that has been observed to be upregulated in growth inhibited and terminally differentiated cells . In addition , a nuclear protein associated with senescence and withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle , statin , is also expressed by THP-1 cells in response to TGF-beta 1 treatment . These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 is capable of inducing expression of specific nuclear proteins associated with differentiation and/or cessation of proliferation that may result in changes in nuclear organization and altered gene expression . Such changes in nuclear organization may be incompatible with continued proliferation of the cells .
Chromatographic , peptide mapping and mass spectrometric analysis were used to examine hemoglobin ( Hb ) from heavy drinkers and abstainers for alcohol consumption-related modifications . Heavy drinker and abstainer hemoglobin samples contained similar amounts of glycosylated Hb and significantly different ( p < 0.05 ) amounts of " fast " hemoglobin . The presence of higher amounts of " fast " Hb in heavy drinker relative to abstainer samples suggested the presence of alcohol-consumption related modifications . To further examine Hb for modifications , tryptic peptides of the " fast " hemoglobin HbA1c were isolated and analyzed by plasma desorption mass spectrometry ( PDMS). [ 14C]acetaldehyde ( AcH)-Hb was synthesized in vivo for use as a standard . Specific peptides were chosen based on co-migration with radiolabeled peptides from a tryptic digest of the [ 14C]acetaldehyde-Hb . The masses obtained by PDMS for two heavy drinker peptides were identical to two radiolabeled peptides ; the two pairs of peptides co-migrated on HPLC . A comparison of the observed mass for the peptides with the theoretical masses for acetaldehyde-modified Hb peptides suggested that the peptides were AcH-modified alpha and beta chain N-termini of Hb . The modified peptides were found in five of six heavy drinker samples . This is the first description of site-specific AcH-Hb adducts occurring in vivo . The routine detection of such adducts has potential for characterizing usual alcohol intake .
A tumor growth-dependent elevation in the hepatic levels of Zn and metallothionein ( MT ) , without a change in the level of Cu , was found in mice and rats bearing solid tumors in the inguinal region . The levels of Zn and MT thus elevated gave a significant correlation ( r = 0.95 ) between them . Nevertheless , when tumor-bearing mice and rats were fed a Zn-deficient diet , the hepatic levels of Zn and MT did not increase . In mice in which inflammation was induced at the same region , on the other hand , hepatic levels of Zn and MT increased transiently after the injection of turpentine or carrageenan even when they were fed the Zn-deficient diet . These results suggest that the elevation of MT and Zn levels can be a helpful marker for detecting malignancy .
Cells dissociated from spontaneous and transplanted tumours of C3HJax mammary gland have been cultured on polylysine and gelatin substrates . The isolated cells proliferated to form monolayers with high degree of organoid structure as indicated by formation of alveolar cavities . Differences were observed in the cell attachment , growth pattern , number and size of alveolar cavities , cells which lined the cavity and cell morphology on polylysine and gelatin substrates as compared to conventional cell culture plastic surface . On polylysine more than 90% cells attached rapidly , within 15-45 min after plating , with or without serum and formed confluent monolayers marked by presence of large and small alveolar cavities . Multiple interacting cell types took part in organization of the cavity . Cells lining the cavity constantly proliferated and rearranged to expand it . On gelatin , 60-70% cells attached over a period of 6-24 hr in presence of serum and formed confluent monolayers dominated by small alveolar cavities . Cells forming the cavities were epithelial in nature and cavities once formed did not increase in size . Upon subculture , the cell morphology on these substrates was strikingly different . On polylysine , the predominant cell type had numerous irregular microvilli whereas on gelatin , cells had smoother boundaries with a few stunted cytoplasmic extensions . The cell attachment on conventional surface was low , 40-50% . When seeded at high cell density , formation of alveolar cavities was suppressed and at low cell density , cultures were marked by contact inhibition of cells and failure to attain confluence . These results suggest differential behaviour and interaction of mammary tumour epithelium with the substrates used .
The use of substrates containing well defined adducts at precise sites , is required to perform a careful analysis of the toxic and mutagenic potential of a lesion . As a first step in this direction the octamer 5'-d(CCGGCGGT) , containing the sequence of the codons 12 d(GGC) and 13 d(GGT) of the human H-ras gene , was reacted with the antitumoral drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) . The platinated products have been purified by HPLC . A first set of experiments , including enzymatic digestions with nuclease P1 followed by alkaline phosphatase and acid-catalysed hydrolysis , allowed us to determine which bases were engaged in the cis-DDP lesions . Our results indicate that only guanine residues were chelated with cisplatin to yield bifunctional adducts . Furthermore , by performing enzymatic digestions with phosphodiesterases , we have located the adducts with respect to the 5 ' end of the octamer . Among the purified and characterized platinated oligonucleotides , three present a particular interest , since we have shown here that the cis-d(GpG) adduct is precisely situated either at the d(GGC) or at the d(GGT) or at both sites of their sequence .
Using an immunoradiometric assay , Cathepsin D ( Cath D ) levels were measured in the cytosol of 23 normal and 39 neoplastic human laryngeal tissues . Scattered Cath D levels ( from 2.2 to 17.8 pM/mg protein ; median = 7.6 ) were found in normal mucosa specimens . Cath D concentrations range from 2.0 to 29.3 pM/mg protein ( median = 8.5 ) in laryngeal tumors . When a comparison between Cath D levels in normal and neoplastic tissue specimens from the same patient was done , Cath D levels were significantly higher in laryngeal cancers than in their normal counterparts ( P = 0.03 ) . No correlation with clinico-pathological parameters and steroid hormone and epidermal growth factor receptor status was found . Further studies should investigate whether the production of Cath D by laryngeal tumors could have a clinical relevance for this neoplasia .
To assess the importance of changes in DNA methylation in an X-ray-induced cellular transformation process , methylation patterns of five nuclear protooncogenes in fifteen transformant clones were studied and compared to that of the parental non-transformed cell line m5S/1M . All transformants examined revealed an alteration in DNA methylation in some of the genes , although these changes were variable among them . A comparison of cellular characteristics with corresponding DNA methylation changes in different clones suggested that the loss of contact inhibition and the gain of anchorage independency were associated with increases of methylation in many genes , whereas the acquisition of tumorigenicity was often accompanied by a decrease of methylation in the N-myc and c-myc genes . Resultant data indicate that the alteration of DNA methylation is closely related to transformation process , yet how this involvement occurs is complex and remains unclear .
We have extended our studies on the relationship between cisplatin/carboplatin-induced DNA damage in readily accessible tissue(s) and clinical response to therapy . Such an approach may assist in the study of cancer drug resistance and in establishing parameters for assessing human populations for sensitivity to DNA damaging agents in the environment . Platinum-DNA adduct levels were measured by atomic absorbance spectrometry . DNA repair capacity was assessed in human T-lymphocytes by the ability to repair cisplatin lesions in cellular DNA or in transfected plasmid DNA . In a " blinded " study of 21 patients receiving combination cisplatin/carboplatin drug therapy , there was a direct relationship between DNA damage in leukocytes and disease response ( summary two-sided p = 0.00011 ) . The cohort of patients had 15 different tumor types , suggesting that blood tissue and tumor tissue of an individual may process platinum-DNA damage similarly regardless of the tissue of origin of the tumor . In leukocytes in vivo , persistence and accumulation were prominent features of the cisplatin-DNA adduct profile . Functional DNA repair capacity has been studied in eight human leukocyte cell lines in vitro ( three , T-cells ; three , B-cells ; one , monocytic ; one , promyelocytic ) , using a host cell reactivation assay with cisplatin-damaged pRSVcat . In the three T cell lines studied , host cell reactivation efficiency was directly related to the cells ' abilities to repair cisplatin-damaged cellular DNA ( correlation coefficient = 0.993).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Psoralen photoreaction with DNA produces interstrand crosslinks , which require the activity of excision and recombinational pathways for repair . Yeast replicating plasmids , carrying the HIS3 , TRP1 , and URA3 genes , were photoreacted with psoralen in vitro and transfected into Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells . Repair was assayed as the relative transformation efficiency . A recombination-deficient rad52 strain was the least efficient in the repair of psoralen-damaged plasmids ; excision repair-deficient rad1 and rad3 strains had repair efficiencies intermediate between those of rad52 and RAD cells . The level of repair also depended on the conditions of transformant selection ; repair was more efficient in medium lacking tryptophan than in medium from which either histidine or uracil was omitted . The plasmid repair differential between these selective media was greatest in rad1 cells , and depended on RAD52 . Plasmid-chromosome recombination was stimulated by psoralen damage , and required RAD52 function . Chromosome to plasmid gene conversion was seen most frequently at the HIS3 locus . In RAD and rad3 cells , the majority of the conversions were associated with plasmid integration , while in rad1 cells most were non-crossover events . Plasmid to chromosome gene conversion was observed most frequently at the TRP1 locus , and was accompanied by plasmid loss .
We analyzed the clinico-pathological features of the initial tumors in 205 patients with superficial bladder cancer , admitted to Kyoto University Hospital between 1974 and 1988 , to investigate the prognostic factors for progression to the muscle invasive disease or metastasis . Of 205 patients , 35 ( 17% ) exhibited muscular invasion alone ( 12 patients ) and/or metastasis ( 23 patients ) . Tumor multiplicity , higher grade and positive urinary cytology were the significant risk factors for later malignant progression . Expression of A , B , H-blood group isoantigens in the bladder tumor were significantly decreased from the onset in the patients with initially T1 tumor but not in those with Ta tumor . Significant loss of expression was also found at the time of progression in the initially Ta cases . Thus , loss of A , B , H-blood group antigen expression seems to be correlated with the malignant potential of superficial bladder cancer . However , more feasible and reliable diagnostic markers such as molecular genetical and biochemical markers remain to be developed to predict the malignant potential of the superficial bladder cancer .
Although it has been demonstrated that discrete origins of DNA replication exist in eukaryotic cellular chromosomes , the detailed organization of a eukaryotic cellular origin remains to be determined . Linker substitution mutations were constructed across the entire Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomal origin , ARS1 . Functional studies of these mutants revealed one essential element ( A ) , which includes a match to the ARS consensus sequence , and three additional elements ( B1 , B2 , and B3 ) , which collectively are also essential for origin function . These four elements arranged exactly as in ARS1 , but surrounded by completely unrelated sequence , functioned as an efficient origin . Element B3 is the binding site for the transcription factor-origin binding protein ABF1 . Other transcription factor binding sites substitute for the B3 element and a trans-acting transcriptional activation domain is required . The multipartite nature of a chromosomal replication origin and the role of transcriptional activators in its function present a striking similarity to the organization of eukaryotic promoters .
The hypothesis that rodent cells can be immortalized by the direct induction of a single mutation-like event was tested by initiating cultures of benzo(a)pyrene treated Syrian hamster embryo cells with low inocula and expanding these few cells maximally until senescence prevented further culturing or immortalization took place . According to the mutation hypothesis immortalization is hardly to be expected under these conditions . However , immortalization was frequently observed . Therefore the induction of immortalization appears indirect . The progeny of benzo(a)pyrene treated cells immortalized with a rate of 3.9 x 10(-8)/cell/generation , which is 64 times higher than the spontaneous rate . The results are in line with the probabilistic theory developed in 1980 by both Fernandez et al . ( Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA , 77 : 7272-7276 , 1980 ) and Kennedy et al . ( Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA , 77 : 7262-7266 , 1980 ) , which states that treatment of cells with a carcinogen can result in a so-called activated state of the treated cells which is transmitted to the progeny and which results in an enhanced rate of transforming events .
Cellular senescence is the genetically programmed cessation of cellular proliferation . We have recently mapped a putative senescence gene(s) on the X chromosome of Chinese hamster embryo ( CHE ) cells . In the present study , we have utilized microcell-mediated chromosome transfer ( microcell fusion ) to test whether : ( i ) the human X chromosome exhibits similar genetic potential to induce senescence and ( ii ) the deletion or inactivation of the X-linked senescence gene(s) in CHE cells is associated with nickel-induced immortalization . A normal CHE or human X chromosome was first introduced into mouse-cell hybrids , then transferred by microcell fusion into a nickel-transformed , immortal male CHE cell line ( Ni-2/TGR ) with an X deletion ( Xq1 ) . Microcell fusion of the normal CHE X chromosome into tumorigenic Ni-2/TGR cells yielded senescence of all X recipient clones . The normal human X chromosome induced dominant senescence of tumorigenic Ni-2/TGR cells in only 17% of the resulting microcell hybrids ( 14/81 ) . Karyotypic analyses of 13 non-senescing human X chromosome-derived microcell hybrid clones revealed that none of these clones retained the complete X. A normal CHE X chromosome induced senescence of 75% of hybrids obtained with another immortal and tumorigenic nickel-transformed male CHE cell line ( Ni-6/TGR ) , which exhibited no visible deletion of the X chromosome , while the normal human X chromosome , only induced senescence in 19% of these hybrids . Transfer of the normal CHE or human X chromosome into spontaneously transformed and tumorigenic cell lines , CHO/TGR or V79/TGR , had little or no effect on their growth . These data suggest that both human and CHE cells possess similar X-linked genetic activities that regulate the process of cellular senescence , and that in Chinese hamster cells nickel-induced immortalization but not that of CHO or V79 cells is associated with inactivation of an X-linked senescence gene .
Clones of mortal chicken fibroblasts and erythroblasts transformed by temperature-sensitive v-src and v-erb B oncoproteins have been developed into immortal cell lines that retain the conditional transformed phenotype . The expressions of two tumor suppressor genes , the retinoblastoma ( Rb ) gene and the p53 gene , were investigated during senescence , crisis , and cell line establishment . In temperature-sensitive ( ts)-v-erb B erythroblasts and ts-v-src fibroblasts ( as well as in v-myc macrophages ) , loss of p53 mRNA or expression of a mutated p53 gene invariably occurred in the early phase of immortalization . In contrast , expression of the Rb gene was unchanged at all stages of immortalization . Inactivation of the original temperature-sensitive oncogene led to loss of the transformed phenotype in fibroblasts and to differentiation in erythroblasts , even in lines that were immortal and lacked p53 . The results demonstrate that the process of immortalization is distinct from cell transformation , probably requiring different mutational events .
Loss of telomeric DNA during cell proliferation may play a role in ageing and cancer . Since telomeres permit complete replication of eukaryotic chromosomes and protect their ends from recombination , we have measured telomere length , telomerase activity and chromosome rearrangements in human cells before and after transformation with SV40 or Ad5 . In all mortal populations , telomeres shortened by approximately 65 bp/generation during the lifespan of the cultures . When transformed cells reached crisis , the length of the telomeric TTAGGG repeats was only approximately 1.5 kbp and many dicentric chromosomes were observed . In immortal cells , telomere length and frequency of dicentric chromosomes stabilized after crisis . Telomerase activity was not detectable in control or extended lifespan populations but was present in immortal populations . These results suggest that chromosomes with short ( TTAGGG)n tracts are recombinogenic , critically shortened telomeres may be incompatible with cell proliferation and stabilization of telomere length by telomerase may be required for immortalization .
Considerable debate centers on the optimal treatment for vulvar melanoma , as well as those clinicopathological factors influencing prognosis . We reviewed 80 patients with vulvar melanoma seen between 1949 and 1990 . Primary tumors were assessed according to Chung ( 47 patients ) and Breslow ( 65 patients ) microstaging systems . Fifty-nine patients ( 76% ) underwent radical vulvectomy , ten patients ( 13% ) had a partial vulvectomy , and nine patients ( 12% ) had a wide local excision . Fifty-six also underwent inguinal node dissection . Median follow-up was 193 months . Median survival was 63 months . Ten-year survival by Chung level was as follows : I 100% ; II , 81% ; III , 87% ; IV , 11% ; V , 33% . Ten-year survival by tumor thickness was as follows : 0.75 mm , 48% ; 0.75-1.5 mm , 68% ; 1.51-3.0 mm , 44% ; greater than 3.0 mm , 22% . Increased depth of invasion was associated with increased incidence of inguinal node metastasis . Cox regression analysis demonstrated prognostic significance for tumor thickness ( P less than 0.001 ) , inguinal node metastasis ( P less than 0.001 ) , and older age at diagnosis ( P less than 0.001 ) . Radical vulvectomy did not seem to improve survival over less radical procedures . Based on this experience , we recommend radical local excision for patients with malignant melanoma of the vulva . Patients who have more than a superficially invasive melanoma should also have inguinal lymph node dissection .
Twelve postmenopausal women ( 54-93 years ) with primary breast carcinoma were treated with tamoxifen due to infirmity or refusal to undergo surgery . Seven premenopausal patients ( 32-50 years ) were given preoperative chemotherapy because of large tumors or inflammatory carcinoma . Fine-needle aspiration biopsy was used to procure tumor cells for diagnosis , hormone receptor determination and analysis of proliferation fraction . Aspirations were repeated every 3 months in the tamoxifen group and each month in patients receiving chemotherapy . Two patients who responded to tamoxifen had tumors with more than 75% estrogen receptor positive cells . A decreased proliferation fraction was observed in two tumors responding to tamoxifen . Eight patients , all with estrogen receptor positive tumors , had stable disease . Progressive disease was observed in two patients with less than 25% receptor positive cells . In these tumors the percentage of proliferating cells remained high during therapy . Objective response was recorded for six patients treated with chemotherapy . The clinical response was reflected in a decreased proliferation fraction . No correlation was observed between response and percentage of proliferating cells in the untreated tumor . The results suggest that analysis of tumor cell characteristics such as hormone receptor content and proliferation fraction can be used to predict and monitor response to endocrine treatment and chemotherapy in breast carcinomas .
Because PRL has growth factor activities in several tissues , we have asked whether it also has autocrine growth factor activity in pituitary GH3 cells . GH3 cells were grown at increasing densities in the presence or absence of antirat PRL ( polyclonal and monoclonal ) or nonspecific antibodies . Cell proliferation increased with increasing cell density , as did the concentration of PRL in the medium . Antirat PRL , but not control antibody , markedly inhibited but did not eliminate cell proliferation , and this effect was diminished with increasing PRL concentration in the medium . PRL receptors were demonstrated on 40-50% of the cells by indirect immunofluorescence using a specific antirat PRL receptor monoclonal antibody . Cell surface PRL was colocalized to the same 40-50% of the cells and copatched or cocapped along with the receptors . Absence or presence of PRL receptors did not correlate with stage of the cell cycle , as judged by ethidium bromide dual labeling . Cell surface PRL was found to be on PRL-containing cells . These data have fulfilled four criteria necessary for establishment of a substance as a secreted autocrine growth factor : 1 ) the factor must be secreted ; 2 ) in log growth phase , increased cell proliferation should occur at increased cell densities ; 3 ) the cells must display a receptor for the factor ; and 4 ) there must be a growth response to the factor . Thus we have established that PRL is an autocrine growth factor for at least 40-50% of the GH3 cell population . This , to our knowledge , is the first example of autocrine growth factor activity of a major hormone normotopically expressed .
The effects of human interferon ( IFN)-alpha , -beta , and -gamma on the immortalization of human and rabbit lymphocytes by human T-lymphotropic virus type-I ( HTLV-I ) have been investigated . The immortalization of human peripheral-blood lymphocytes co-cultured with lethally X-ray-irradiated HTLV-I-producer cells , MT-2 , was blocked in the presence of more than 40 u/ml human recombinant IFN-alpha or more than 200 u/ml human natural type IFN-beta . However , rhIFN-gamma did not block immortalization by HTLV-I even at higher doses . On the other hand , the presence of high doses of hIFN-alpha , -beta , or -gamma did not exhibit any biological effect on the immortalization of rabbit peripheral-blood lymphocytes co-cultured with lethally X-ray-irradiated MT-2 cells . Integration of the full length of HTLV-I genome was detected in every transformant by Southern blot analysis . All cell lines established were CD4+/CD8 divided by T-lymphocytes , except for one cell line of CD4+/CD8+ . Morphologically intact HTLV-I production was observed by electron microscopy in these cells . Our results indicate that HTLV-I released under the strongly suppressed condition in the presence of IFNs remains active and able to immortalize T lymphocytes . It is also suggested that immortalization of human T lymphocytes by HTLV-I can be inhibited by the antiviral state induced by the treatment with low doses of hIFN-alpha and -beta , whereas immortalization of rabbit T lymphocytes is not inhibited because of the species specificity of hIFNs .
We have constructed plasmids pS3G-1 and pSG4 that contain single acetylaminofluorene adducts within contiguous runs of three ( 5'-CCCG1G2G3-3' ) and four ( 5'-CG1GGG4T-3' ) guanine residues , respectively . In Escherichia coli , the frequency of induced -1 frameshift mutations was strongly dependent on the position of modification : pS3G-G3 was approximately 100-fold and 10-fold more mutagenic than pS3G-G1 and pS3G-G2 , respectively ; pSG4-G4 was approximately 600-fold more mutagenic than pSG4-G1 . Mutagenesis was SOS-dependent and was markedly reduced in bacteria that were proficient in nucleotide excision repair as compared to a repair-deficient uvrA6 mutant . DNA sequencing showed that -1 frameshift events in pS3G-1 consisted of either targeted mutations ( greater than 90% of induced mutations ) within the guanine sequence or semitargeted mutations ( greater than 10% ) in the 5 ' flanking repetitive cytosine sequence . Semitargeted events , which were observed when acetylaminofluorene modification was at G1 and G2 , show that a lesion can reduce the fidelity of replication at positions 5 ' to its location on the template strand . No semitargeted frameshifts were observed in plasmid pSG4 , which lacks a repetitive sequence 5 ' to the adduct . Our results are consistent with a model for frameshift mutagenesis in which the acetylaminofluorene adduct ( i ) allows accurate incorporation of cytosine opposite the bulky lesion during DNA synthesis and ( ii ) impedes elongation of primer/template termini formed opposite the adduct or 5 ' to the adduct on the template strand , providing increased opportunity for the formation of slipped frameshift intermediates .
Ghrelin was identified in the stomach as an endogenous ligand specific for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor ( GHS-R ) . GHS-R is found in various tissues , but its function is unknown . Here we show that GHS-R is found in hepatoma cells . Exposure of these cells to ghrelin caused up-regulation of several insulin-induced activities including tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 ( IRS-1 ) , association of the adapter molecule growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 with IRS-1 , mitogen-activated protein kinase activity , and cell proliferation . Unlike insulin , ghrelin inhibited Akt kinase activity as well as up-regulated gluconeogenesis . These findings raise the possibility that ghrelin modulates insulin activities in humans .
Adoptive transfer of immunity against hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) was previously shown to facilitate suppression of experimental human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) expressing HBsAg in athymic mice . We have shown that oral tolerance induces antigen-specific immune suppression of HBsAg by feeding hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) antigens . In the present study we evaluated the effect of oral tolerance induction toward HBV or HCC antigens on the growth of experimental HCC-expressing HBsAg in mice . Tolerance induction was induced in mice by 5 oral feedings of 1 microg HBV antigens or HCC-extracted proteins ( 50 microg protein ) before vaccination with recombinant HBsAg . Splenocytes ( 2 x 10(6) ) from these mice were transferred to sublethally irradiated athymic BALB/c mice previously transplanted subcutaneously with 10(7) human hepatoma Hep3B cells . Adoptive transfer of splenocytes immunized toward HBsAg prevented tumor growth . At 4 weeks after splenocyte transplantation , tumor volume and serum alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP ) levels in athymic mice transplanted with splenocytes immunized to HBsAg were undetectable as compared with 1,048 +/- 738 mm(3) and 2,500 +/- 1,431 ng/ml in recipients of na<FFFD>ve splenocytes ( p < 0.0001 ) . Mice receiving splenocytes tolerized toward Hep3B cells , as manifested by reduced serum HBs antibody levels , reduced HBV-specific stimulation index and reduced HBV-specific-IFN gamma spot-forming cells , had early tumor growth evident by elevated AFP serum levels , weight loss and mortality , which were suppressed at 6 weeks . Mice transplanted with splenocytes tolerized toward HBV antigens did not have direct evidence of tumor growth . Induction of oral tolerance toward HCC-extracted proteins enabled transient tumor growth in this model . This effect was mediated through downregulation of the anti-HBV immune response .
To characterize the impact of increased production of TGF-beta in a xenograft model of human breast cancer , TGF-beta-responsive MDA-231 cells were genetically modified by stable transfection so as to increase their production of active TGF-beta1 . Compared with control cells , cells that produced increased amounts of TGF-beta proliferated in vitro more slowly . In vivo , however , tumors derived from these cells exhibited increased proliferation and grew at an accelerated pace . To evaluate the role of autocrine TGF-beta signaling , cells were also transfected with a dominant-negative truncated type II TGF-beta receptor ( TbetaRII ) . Disruption of autocrine TGF-beta signaling in the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells reduced their in vivo growth rate . Co-inoculation of Matrigel with the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells expressing the truncated TbetaRII compensated for their diminished in vivo growth capacity , compared with the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells with an intact autocrine loop . Tissue invasion by the tumor was a distinctive feature of the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells , whether or not the autocrine loop was intact . Furthermore , tumors derived from TGF-beta-overexpressing cells , irrespective of the status of the autocrine TGF-beta-signaling pathway , had a higher incidence of lung metastasis . Consistent with the suggestion that TGF-beta's enhancement of invasion and metastasis is paracrine-based , we observed no significant differences among the cell clones in an in vitro invasion assay . Thus , in this experimental model system in vitro assays of cell proliferation and invasion do not accurately reflect in vivo observations , perhaps due to autocrine and paracrine effects of TGF-beta that influence the important in vivo-based phenomena of tumor growth , invasion , and metastasis .
The involvement of PRL in regulating monocyte/macrophage functions is suggested by the presence of PRL-Rs in these cells . Here , we show that PRL , though it failed to activate mouse peritoneal resident macrophages ( RMs ) , acted as a second signal and activated mouse peritoneal inflammatory macrophages ( EMs ) to a tumoricidal state . The cytotoxicity of mouse tumor-associated macrophages ( TAMs ) isolated at day 1 of tumor ( Ehrlich ascites carcinoma , EAC ) growth was enhanced by PRL . However , with progression of tumor growth , TAMs became nonresponsive to the hormone . PRL-induced killing of P815 target cells by EMs and TAMs was independent of TNF but correlated with the hormone-induced augmentation of NO2(-) and O2(-) release in these macrophages . Administration of PRL in vivo inhibited EAC growth and augmented NO2(-) release by TAMs . PRL synergized with the TH1 cytokine IFN-gamma , a known activator of macrophages , in inducing tumor killing and release of NO2(-) from EMs and TAMs . The hormone might activate macrophages at least partially , through the release of IFN-gamma as anti-IFN-gamma blocked IFN-gamma- as well as PRL-induced cytotoxicity in EMs . The TH2 cytokine IL-4 suppressed PRL-induced activation of macrophages . PRL induced release of IL-12 from EMs also , which suggested that the hormone might drive the TH1 response through IL-12 . Our observations further suggest that PRL alone and in synergy with IFN-gamma , released through induction of IL-12 , may generate tumoricidal macrophages and thus regulate the antitumor immune response of tumor hosts .
Primary fibroblasts respond to activated H-RAS(V12) by undergoing premature arrest , which resembles replicative senescence . This irreversible ' fail-safe mechanism ' requires p19(ARF) , p53 and the Retinoblastoma ( Rb ) family : upon their disruption , RAS(V12)-expressing cells fail to undergo senescence and continue to proliferate . Similarly , co-expression of oncogenes such as c-MYC or E1A rescues RAS(V12)-induced senescence . To identify novel genes that allow escape from RAS(V12)-induced senescence , we designed an unbiased , retroviral complementary DNA library screen . We report on the identification of DRIL1 , the human orthologue of the mouse Bright and Drosophila dead ringer transcriptional regulators . DRIL1 renders primary murine fibroblasts unresponsive to RAS(V12)-induced anti-proliferative signalling by p19(ARF)/p53/p21(CIP1) , as well as by p16(INK4a) . In this way , DRIL1 not only rescues RAS(V12)-induced senescence but also causes these fibroblasts to become highly oncogenic . Furthermore , DRIL1 immortalizes mouse fibroblasts , in the presence of high levels of p16(INK4a) . Immortalization by DRIL1 , whose product binds the pRB-controlled transcription factor E2F1 ( ref. 8 ) , is correlated with induction of E2F1 activity . Correspondingly , DRIL1 induces the E2F1 target Cyclin E1 , overexpression of which is sufficient to trigger escape from senescence . Thus , DRIL1 disrupts cellular protection against RAS(V12)-induced proliferation downstream of the p19(ARF)/p53 pathway .
p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in many human malignancies , including gastric cancer . It remains unclear why patients with germ-line p53 mutations ( i.e. , Li-Fraumeni syndrome ) are not at increased risk for gastric adenocarcinoma , despite the fact that they show a high rate of many other tumors . Furthermore , the precise relationship between germ-line p53 mutations and the response to chronic bacterial infections ( such as Helicobacter spp. ) has not been investigated . To assess the role of germ-line p53 deletions in modulating the progression to gastric cancer , p53(+/-) and wild-type ( WT ) C57BL/6 mice were infected with H. felis . The gastric pathology and immune response in these two groups of mice were analyzed for up to 15 months postinfection . The gastric fundus and antrum were evaluated independently using a 0-4 scale to score inflammation , parietal and chief cell loss , mucus metaplasia , and helicobacter colonization . Nonparametric statistical analysis was performed to determine the effects of p53(+/-) , infection status , and postinoculation ( p.i. ) time on inflammation , preneoplastic changes , invasive lesions , and helicobacter colonization. mRNA expression for gammaIFN , interleukin ( IL)-1 , IL-10 , and IL-4 was quantified by PCR . Sera were also evaluated for H. felis antibody by ELISA . Antral inflammation increased significantly with time in infected mice . There was a significant , protective effect on the development of preneoplastic fundic lesions and invasive carcinoma attributable to the deletion of one p53 allele ( P < 0.05 ) . Submucosal invasive foci were observed in 9 of 11 WT-infected mice ranging from 13 to 15 months p.i. ; invasion of adjacent submucosal blood vessels by glandular epithelia also was present in 5 of these mice . None of these lesions were observed in 33 p53(+/-) mice , infected or not , at any time p.i. p53(+/-) mice had significantly higher helicobacter colonization consistent with a Th2 host response . In sera from WT mice , IgG2a , considered a proinflammatory Th1 response , continued to rise throughout the 15-month study ( P < 0.004 ) . In contrast , IgG2a levels of the p53(+/-) mice were 50-60% lower than those of the WT mice at each time point ( P range , <0.012 to 0.002 ) and did not progress in magnitude between 12 and 15 months of chronic H. felis infection ( P = 0.167). mRNA levels for gammaIFN and IL-1 were significantly up-regulated in WT mice infected with H. felis ( P < 0.05 ) but were slightly elevated or were at background levels in p53(+/-) mice . IL-10 and IL-4 mRNA expression was not significantly different from control samples . Our results support the hypothesis that germ-line deletion of one p53 allele results in a down-regulated Th1 response to gastric helicobacter infection , possibly because of T-cell senescence , which may indirectly protect against the development of gastric cancer and other epithelial-derived neoplasms associated with chronic inflammation .
P53 activity plays a key role in mammalian cells when they undergo replicative senescence at their Hayflick limit . To determine whether p63 proteins , members of the family of p53-related genes , are also involved in this process , we examined their expression in serially passaged rat embryo fibroblasts . Upon senescence , two truncated DeltaNp63 proteins decreased in abundance whereas two TAp63 isoforms accumulated. 2-D gel analysis showed that the DeltaNp63 proteins underwent post-translational modifications in both proliferating and senescent cells . Direct binding of DeltaNp63 proteins to a p53 consensus motif was greater in proliferating cells than senescent cells . In contrast p63alpha isoforms bound to DNA in a p53 dependent manner and this was higher in senescent cells than proliferating cells . An interaction of p63alpha proteins with SV40 large tumour antigen was also detected and ectopic expression of DeltaNp63alpha can extend the lifespan of rat embryo fibroblasts . Taken together the results indicate that p63 proteins may play a role in replicative senescence either by competition for p53 DNA binding sites or by direct interaction with p53 protein bound to DNA .
Mesotheliomas are malignant tumors of the pleural and peritoneal membranes which are often associated with asbestos exposure and with Simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) infection . Telomerase activity is repressed in somatic cells and tissues but is activated in immortal and malignant cells . We evaluated telomerase activity in seven primary malignant mesothelioma biopsies and matched lung specimens and 20 mesothelioma cell lines and eight corresponding primary tumor cultures . All the tumor biopsies , and nearly all primary cell mesothelioma cultures and cell lines were telomerase positive . The findings in cell lines paralleled those observed in primary cultures in cases where paired samples were available . Next , we found that SV40 , a DNA tumor virus present in approximately 50% of mesothelioma biopsies in the USA , induced telomerase activity in primary human mesothelial cells , but not in primary fibroblasts . Telomerase activity became detectable as early as 72 h following wild-type ( strain 776 ) SV40 infection , and a clear DNA ladder was detectable 1 week after infection . The amount of telomerase activity increased during passage in cell culture and appeared to parallel increases in the cellular amounts of the SV40 large T-antigen . Thus , SV40 infection leads to telomerase activity before the infected mesothelial cells become transformed and immortalized . SV40 infection of human fibroblasts did not cause detectable telomerase activity . We also determined that the SV40 small t-antigen ( tag ) plays an important role in inducing telomerase activity because this activity was undetectable or minimal in mesothelial cells infected and/or transformed by SV40 tag mutants . Asbestos alone did not induce telomerase activity , and asbestos did not influence telomerase activity in mesothelial cells infected with SV40 . Induction of telomerase activity by SV40 may be related to the very high rate of mesothelial cell immortalization that is characteristically associated with SV40 infection of mesothelial cells .
Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) has emerged as one of the most important angiogenic growth factors from experimental in vitro and in vivo studies . In the present study , we investigated the relationship between VEGF expression and microvessel density ( MVD ) and defined their prognostic relevance on a series of 242 patients with node-negative breast cancer , using immunohistochemical methods . In parallel , estrogen and progesterone receptors were quantitatively assessed using the dextran-charcoal technique and cell proliferation was evaluated as S-phase cell fraction according to ( 3)H-thymidine-labeling index ( TLI ) . The percentage of VEGF-expressing cells varied from 0-95% in the different tumors and was unrelated to menopausal status , tumor size or steroid receptor status . Conversely , a significant inverse relation was observed with patient age or tumor cell proliferation , albeit with very poor correlation coefficients . A significant relation was observed between VEGF expression and MVD ( r(s) = 0.55 , p < 0.001 ) . Clinical outcome analyzed as a function of high and low VEGF expression showed slight differences in terms of both disease-free survival ( DFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) that never reached statistical significance . Moreover , the trend was paradoxically in favor of patients with highly VEGF-expressing tumors . Finally , DFS and OS curves , when analyzed as a function of VEGF expression or MVD , were superimposable . In conclusion , our study did not highlight a prognostic relevance of VEGF expression in patients with node-negative breast cancer , as already observed for MVD .
It is well known that cell-mediated immunity is suppressed in patients with neoplastic diseases . We have reported that soluble receptors for interleukin-2 ( sIL-2R ) and tumor necrosis factor ( sTNF-R1 ) are elevated in the serum of patients with advanced colorectal cancer . The presence of these soluble receptors and immunosuppressive cytokines , including interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) , might be important in the mechanisms of immunosuppression. cis-Diaminedichloroplatinum ( cisplatin ) has been reported to immunomodulate , especially when used in low dose in combination with 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) . In this study , cisplatin and UFT , a form of uracil and tegafur which is a prodrug of 5-FU , were administered with immunomodulator Polysaccharide K ( PSK ) to ten patients with colorectal cancer , who showed distant metastasis in the liver or lung , and the serum levels of sIL-2R and sTNF-R1 and the production of gamma-interferon ( gamma-INF ) and interleukin-10 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured . The serum concentrations of sIL-2R and the production of IL-10 were reduced ( p < 0.05 ) after 2 months of treatment . Thus , this combination appeared to have immunomodulative potential in patients with advanced colorectal cancer .
Senescence limits the proliferative capacity of primary cells in culture . We describe here a genetic screen to identify genes that allow bypass of this checkpoint . Using retroviral cDNA expression libraries , we identify BCL6 as a potent inhibitor of senescence . BCL6 is frequently activated in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma , but its mechanism of action has remained unclear . BCL6 efficiently immortalizes primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and cooperates with RAS in oncogenic transformation . BCL6 overrides the senescence response downstream of p53 through a process that requires induction of cyclin D1 expression , as cyclin D1 knockout fibroblasts are specifically resistant to BCL6 immortalization . We show that BCL6 expression also dramatically extends the replicative lifespan of primary human B cells in culture and induces cyclin D1 expression , indicating that BCL6 has a similar activity in lymphoid cells . Our results suggest that BCL6 contributes to oncogenesis by rendering cells unresponsive to antiproliferative signals from the p19(ARF)-p53 pathway .
Inflammatory events have been associated with senile plaques , one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) . It is believed that aggregated beta-amyloid ( betaA ) proteins , which form the core of these plaques , may be responsible for triggering the inflammatory reaction . In the present study , the ability of aluminum ( Al ) to initiate similar inflammatory events was investigated in a human glioblastoma cell line . A 6-day exposure to either lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or aluminum sulfate caused a significant increase in the rate of proliferation of the glioblastoma cells . Both treatments also caused activation of the immune-responsive transcription factor NF-kappaB although there were time-related differences . The levels of secreted cytokines , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) were both increased by the LPS treatment although exposure to Al decreased the secretion of the former while elevating the levels of the latter . These events may be due to the activation of glial cells and subsequent stress response to either Al complexes or LPS . Although exposure to either stress factor caused a stimulation of inflammatory markers , there were time-dependent differences in the response . This may reflect the ability of the cells to discern different stress factors and thus orchestrate an innate immune response profile distinct to each immunogen .
BACKGROUND Helicobacter pylori is the main risk factor for the development of non-cardia gastric cancer . Increased proliferation of the gastric mucosa is a feature of H. pylori infection . Mucosal interkeukin-1beta production is increased in H. pylori infection and IL-1beta genotypes associated with increased pro-inflammatory activity are risk factors for the development of gastric cancer . The effect of IL-1beta on gastric epithelial cell proliferation has been examined in this study . METHODS AGS cells were cultured with IL-1beta . DNA synthesis was assed by [ 3H]thymidine incorporation and total viable cell numbers by MTT assay . RESULTS IL-1beta dose dependently increased DNA synthesis and cell numbers . The enhanced proliferation was blocked by interleukin-1 receptor antagonist . Addition of neutralising antibody to GM-CSF reduced IL-1beta-stimulated proliferation by 31 +/- 4 % . GM-CSF alone significantly stimulated proliferation . Addition or neutralisation of IL-8 had no effect on basal or IL-1beta-stimulated proliferation . The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein completely blocked IL-1beta-stimulated proliferation and inhibition of the extracellular signal related kinase pathway with PD 98059 inhibited IL-1beta stimulated proliferation by 58 +/- 5 % . CONCLUSIONS IL-1beta stimulates proliferation in gastric epithelial cells . Autocrine stimulation by GM-CSF contributes to this proliferative response . Signalling via tyrosine kinase activity is essential to the mitogenic response to IL-1beta . The extracellular signal related kinase pathway is involved in , but not essential to downstream signalling . IL-1beta may contribute to the hyperproliferation seen in H. pylori- infected gastric mucosa , and be involved in the carcinogenic process .
The in vitro immortalization of primary human mammary epithelial ( HME ) cells solely by the exogenous introduction of the catalytic subunit of human telomerase ( hTERT ) has been achieved . Early passage hTERT-transfected HME ( T-HME ) cells continuously decreased the length and density of telomeres even in the presence of telomerase activity , with a significant number of cells staining positive for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase ( SA-beta-gal ) . Subsequently , with the increase in cell passages , the copy number of the exogenously transfected hTERT gene and the percentage of SA-beta-gal positive cells were found to decrease . Eventually , a single copy of the exogenous hTERT gene was observed in the relatively later passage T-HME cells in which telomere length was elongated and stabilized without obvious activation of endogenous hTERT and c-Myc expression . In T-HME cells , the expression of two p53 regulated genes p21(WAF) and HDM2 increased ( as in primary senescent HME cells ) , and was found to be further elevated as the function of p53 was activated by treatment with DNA-damaging agents. p16(INK4a) was shown to be significantly higher in the primary senescent HME and the early passage T-HME cells when compared with the primary presenescent HME cells , with a dramatic repression of p16(INK4a) observed in the later passage T-HME cells . In addition , the expression of E2F1 and its transcription factor activity were found to be significantly higher in the later passage T-HME cells when compared with the earlier passage T-HME cells . Together , our results indicate that in vitro immortalization in HME cells may require the activation of the function of telomerase and other genetic alterations such as the spontaneous loss of p16(INK4a) expression .
The cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1) was identified initially as a gene induced in senescent cells and itself has been shown to cause permanent growth arrest/senescence . Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , a byproduct of oxidative processes , can also induce an irreversible growth arrest similar to senescence . Here we show that p21 increased intracellular levels of ROS both in normal fibroblasts and in p53-negative cancer cells . N-acetyl-L-cysteine , an ROS inhibitor , rescued p21-induced senescence , showing that ROS elevation is necessary for induction of the permanent growth arrest phenotype. p16(Ink4a) , a CDK4- and CDK6-specific inhibitor , failed to increase ROS levels , and cell cycle arrest induced by p16 was reversible following its down-regulation , demonstrating the specificity of this p21 effect . A p21 mutant that lacked the ability to bind proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) retained the ability to induce both ROS and permanent growth arrest . All of these findings establish that p21 mediates senescence by a mechanism involving ROS accumulation which does not require either its PCNA binding or the CDK inhibitory functions shared with p16 .
The t(10;11)(p12;q23) chromosomal translocation in human acute myeloid leukemia results in the fusion of the MLL and AF10 genes . The latter codes for a novel leucine zipper protein , one of many MLL fusion partners of unknown function . In this report , we demonstrate that retroviral-mediated transduction of an MLL-AF10 complementary DNA into primary murine myeloid progenitors enhanced their clonogenic potential in serial replating assays and led to their efficient immortalization at a primitive stage of myeloid differentiation . Furthermore , MLL-AF10-transduced cells rapidly induced acute myeloid leukemia in syngeneic or severe combined immunodeficiency recipient mice . Structure/function analysis showed that a highly conserved 82-amino acid portion of AF10 , comprising 2 adjacent alpha-helical domains , was sufficient for immortalizing activity when fused to MLL . Neither helical domain alone mediated immortalization , and deletion of the 29-amino acid leucine zipper within this region completely abrogated transforming activity . Similarly , the minimal oncogenic domain of AF10 exhibited transcriptional activation properties when fused to the MLL or GAL4 DNA-binding domains , while neither helical domain alone did . However , transcriptional activation per se was not sufficient because a second activation domain of AF10 was neither required nor competent for transformation . The requirement for alpha-helical transcriptional effector domains is similar to the oncogenic contributions of unrelated MLL partners ENL and ELL , suggesting a general mechanism of myeloid leukemogenesis by a subset of MLL fusion proteins , possibly through specific recruitment of the transcriptional machinery .
The retinoic acid receptor beta2 ( RARbeta2 ) protein is a putative tumor suppressor that inhibits proliferation and can induce apoptosis when introduced into breast , cervical , lung , and pancreatic cancer cell lines . To determine if RARbeta2 suppresses proliferation of mammary-derived cancer cells in vivo , we transduced MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells with the LXSN retroviral vector containing RARbeta2 and implanted LXSN vector- or RARbeta2-transduced cells into the mammary fat pads of nude and severe combined immune deficiency ( SCID ) mice . We analyzed the xenografts for several tumor parameters , including tumor size , inflammation , vascularity , mitoses , tumor recurrence at the primary site following resection , and metastases . We found that 19 of 52 mice inoculated with vector-transduced cells developed metastases in multiple organs while only one of 55 mice receiving RARbeta2-transduced cells displayed evidence of metastases ( p < 0.000001 , combined experiments , two-tailed Fisher's exact test ) . Moreover , RARbeta2-tumor cell recipient mice had a lower incidence of post-resection tumor recurrence ( 8/55 vs. 25/52 , p = 0.0004 ) , 34% less necrosis ( in three of four experiments , p = 0.001 ) , and 39% fewer mitoses in tumor tissue ( p < 0.000001 ) . Our findings suggest that RARbeta2 may play a role in inhibiting the metastatic cascade in a mouse mammary gland xenograft tumor model and is a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention in human breast cancer .
The yeast Sir2 protein mediates chromatin silencing through an intrinsic NAD-dependent histone deacetylase activity . Sir2 is a conserved protein and was recently shown to regulate lifespan extension both in budding yeast and worms . Here , we show that SIRT1 , the human Sir2 homolog , is recruited to the promyelocytic leukemia protein ( PML ) nuclear bodies of mammalian cells upon overexpression of either PML or oncogenic Ras ( Ha-rasV12 ) . SIRT1 binds and deacetylates p53 , a component of PML nuclear bodies , and it can repress p53-mediated transactivation . Moreover , we show that SIRT1 and p53 co-localize in nuclear bodies upon PML upregulation . When overexpressed in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts ( MEFs ) , SIRT1 antagonizes PML-induced acetylation of p53 and rescues PML-mediated premature cellular senescence . Taken together , our data establish the SIRT1 deacetylase as a novel negative regulator of p53 function capable of modulating cellular senescence .
Insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) and IGF-II stimulate cancer cell proliferation via interaction with the type I IGF receptor ( IGF-IR ) . We put forward the hypothesis that IGF-IR mediates cancer cell growth by regulating amino acid transport , both when sufficient nutrients are present and when key nutrients such as glutamine are in limited supply . We examined the effects of alphaIR3 , the monoclonal antibody recognizing IGF-IR , on cell growth and amino acid transport across the cell membrane in a human neuroblastoma cell line , SK-N-SH . In the presence of alphaIR3 ( 2 micro/ml ) , cell proliferation was significantly attenuated in both control ( 2 mM glutamine ) and glutamine-deprived ( 0 mM glutamine ) groups . Glutamine deprivation resulted in significantly increased glutamate ( system X(AG)(-) ) , MeAIB ( system A ) , and leucine ( system L ) transport , which was blocked by alphaIR3 . Glutamine ( system ASC ) and MeAIB transport was significantly decreased by alphaIR3 in the control group . Addition of alphaIR3 significantly decreased DNA and protein biosynthesis in both groups . Glutamine deprivation increased the IGF-IR protein on the cell surface . Our results suggest that activation of IGF-IR promotes neuroblastoma cell proliferation by regulating trans-membrane amino acid transport .
PURPOSE Astrocytoma arises in the central nervous system as a tumor of great lethality , in part because of the invasive potential of the neoplastic cells that are able to release extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes . Furin convertase activates several precursor matrix metalloproteases involved in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix . In the present study inhibition of furin was achieved by gene transfer of alpha(1)-antitrypsin Portland ( PDX ) cDNA . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN This furin inhibitor was transfected into two tumorigenic astrocytoma cell lines . The inhibitory effect was evaluated using in vivo tumorigenicity , invasion , and proliferation assays , as well as by investigating impairment of furin substrate processing . RESULTS Expression of PDX prevented the s.c. growth of the transfected cells . Invasion assays demonstrated that PDX-transfected cells exhibited a reduced invasive ability in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore , s.c. growth of PDX transfectant xenotransplants showed a significant reduction in size that coincided with a significant decrease of the in vitro doubling time and of the in vivo cell proliferation ability . Additional studies showed that the furin substrates insulin-like growth factor IR , transforming growth factor beta and membrane type 1-matrix metalloprotease were not activated in PDX-expressing astrocytoma cells . CONCLUSIONS PDX expression in astrocytoma cells demonstrated a direct mechanistic link between furin inhibition , and decreased astrocytoma proliferation and invasive ability . Because furin inhibition inhibits both invasiveness and cell growth in astrocytoma , furin should be considered a promising target for glioblastoma therapy .
In vitro model systems for studying uterine leiomyomas are limited in that human-derived leiomyoma cells grow poorly in culture compared with normal myometrial cells and begin to senesce early , at approximately passage 10 in our studies . To our knowledge , a good in vitro human-derived cell culturing system for leiomyomas does not exist . In an attempt to fill this void , we have immortalized a uterine leiomyoma cell line by inducing telomerase activity , which allows cells to bypass their normal programmed senescence . Telomerase activity was induced by infecting the target ( uterine leiomyoma and normal myometrial ) cells with a retroviral vector containing hTERT , the gene for the catalytic subunit of telomerase . Subsequent analysis by RT-PCR and the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay confirmed expression of the inserted gene and induction of telomerase activity in leiomyoma and myometrial cells . Analysis of cells for estrogen receptor-alpha and progesterone receptor proteins by Western blotting showed no change in expression of these proteins between the immortalized and parental leiomyoma and myometrial cells . Both immortalized and parental myometrial and leiomyoma cells expressed the smooth muscle-specific cytoskeletal protein alpha-actin and were negative for mutant p53 protein as evidenced by immunocytochemical staining . The immortalized leiomyoma and myometrial cells showed no anchorage-independent growth , with the exception of a small subpopulation of immortalized leiomyoma cells at a higher passage that did form two to three small colonies ( per 50,000 cells ) in soft agar . None of the immortalized cells were tumorigenic in nude mice . In conclusion , our data show the successful insertion of the hTERT gene into leiomyoma and myometrial cells and the immortalization of these cell lines without phenotypic alteration from the parental cell types ( up to 200 population doublings ) . These cells should help to advance research in understanding the molecular pathways involved in the conversion of a normal myometrial cell to a leiomyoma cell and the mechanisms responsible for the growth of uterine leiomyomas . Answers to these questions will undoubtedly lead to the development of more effective treatment and intervention regimens for clinical cases of uterine leiomyoma .
BACKGROUND : The issue remains unresolved as to whether low frequency magnetic fields can affect cell behaviour , with the possibility that they may be in part responsible for the increased incidence of leukaemia in parts of the population exposed to them . METHODS : Combined treatment of HeLa cells with gamma-irradiation ( 1 , 3 and 5 Grays ) and extra low frequency magnetic fields of Hz was carried out under rigorously controlled conditions . RESULTS : Synchronised cells progressing from S-phase arrived at mitosis on average marginally ahead of irradiation controls not exposed to ELF . In no instance out of a total of twenty separate experiments did this " double-insult " further delay entry of cells into mitosis , as had been anticipated . CONCLUSION : This apparently " non-genotoxic " agent ( ELF ) appears to be capable of affecting cells that would normally arrest for longer in G2 , suggesting a weakening of the stringency of the late cycle ( G2 ) checkpoint .
The association between acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) and the aberrant expression of Hoxa9 is evidenced by ( 1 ) proviral activation of Hoxa9 and Meis1 in BXH-2 murine AML , ( 2 ) formation of the chimeric Nup98-HoxA9 transactivator protein as a consequence of the t(7;11) translocation in human AML , and ( 3 ) the strong expression of HoxA9 and Meis1 in human AML . In mouse models , enforced retroviral expression of Hoxa9 alone in marrow is not sufficient to cause rapid AML , while co-expression of Meis1 and Hoxa9 induces rapid AML . In contrast , retroviral expression of Nup98-HoxA9 is sufficient to cause rapid AML in the absence of enforced Meis1 expression . Previously , we demonstrated that Hoxa9 could block the differentiation of murine marrow progenitors cultured in granulocyte-macrophage colony-simulating factor ( GM-CSF ) . These progenitors lacked Meis1 expression , could not proliferate in stem cell factor ( SCF ) , but could differentiate into neutrophils when switched into granulocyte colony-simulating factor ( G-CSF ) . Ectopic expression of Meis1 in these Hoxa9 cells suppressed their G-CSF-induced differentiation , permitted proliferation in SCF , and therein offered a potential explanation of cooperative function . Because Meis1 binds N-terminal Hoxa9 sequences that are replaced by Nup98 , we hypothesized that Nup98-HoxA9 might consolidate the biochemical functions of both Hoxa9 and Meis1 on target gene promoters and might evoke their same lymphokine-responsive profile in immortalized progenitors . Here we report that Nup98-HoxA9 , indeed mimicks Hoxa9 plus Meis1 coexpression - it immortalizes myeloid progenitors , prevents differentiation in response to GM-CSF , IL-3 , G-CSF , and permits proliferation in SCF . Unexpectedly , however , Nup98-Hoxa9 also enforced strong transcription of the cellular Hoxa9 , Hoxa7 and Meis1 genes at levels similar to those found in mouse AML's generated by proviral activation of Hoxa9 and Meis1 . Using Hoxa9(-/-) marrow , we demonstrate that expression of Hoxa9 is not required for myeloid immortalization by Nup98-HoxA9 . Rapid leukaemogenesis by Nup98-HoxA9 may therefore result from both the intrinsic functions of Nup98-HoxA9 , as well as of those of coexpressed HOX and MEIS1 genes .
BACKGROUND : Previously , we have observed that highly unsaturated dietary ( n-3 ) fatty acids inhibit cell proliferation in conjunction with stimulation of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein ( IGFBP)-6 secretion in Caco-2 cells , a human colon carcinoma cell line . METHODS : To test the converse hypothesis that inhibition of endogenous IGFBP-6 secretion stimulates Caco-2 cell proliferation , cells were transfected with the antisense IGFBP-6 expression construct or pcDNA3 vector only , and single colonies resistant to G418 sulfate were isolated . RESULTS : Our initial studies indicated that three antisense clones grew faster and produced less IGFBP-6 than two pcDNA3 clones , so antisense IGFBP-6 #5 and pcDNA3 #8 were selected for further detailed analysis . Both the control and antisense clones grew in serum-free medium reaching a plateau density at day eight . However , the antisense clone grew at a rate faster than that of the control and reached a final density that was 31 +/- 3% higher than the control . Northern blot , ligand blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that accumulation of IGFBP-6 mRNA and concentrations of IGFBP-6 peptide produced by the antisense clone were decreased by 80-90% compared to the control . The doubling times of the antisense and control clones were 21.9 +/- 0.4 and 24.8 +/- 0.3 h ( P < 0.05 ) , respectively . Exogenous IGF-I and IGF-II ( 0.2-200 nmol/L ) stimulated proliferation of both the control and antisense clones in a dose-dependent manner , but the relative potency and efficacy of IGF-II was higher in the antisense clone compared to the control . These results indicate that suppression of IGFBP-6 secretion correlates with an increase in the basal rate of Caco-2 cell growth . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that IGFBP-6 inhibits cell growth by binding to endogenously produced IGF-II , thereby preventing IGF-II from interacting with the IGF-I receptor to stimulate cellular proliferation by an autocrine mechanism .
Glioblastoma multiforme , the most common form of malignant brain tumor,is resistant to all forms of therapy and causes death within 9-12 months of diagnosis . Glioblastomas are known to contain numerous genetic and physiological alterations affecting cell survival and proliferation ; one of the most common alterations being platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) autocrine signaling characterized by coexpression of PDGF and its receptor . The PDGF family consists of four members , PDGF-A , -B , -C , and -D , that signal through the alpha and beta PDGF receptor ( PDGFR ) tyrosine kinases . Numerous studies have demonstrated expression of PDGF-A , PDGF-B , and the PDGFRs in gliomablastomas , but such studies have not been conducted for the newly identified PDGF-C and -D . Therefore , we examined the expression of all PDGF ligands and receptors in 11 glioma cell lines and 5 primary glioblastoma tumor tissues by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR . Expression of PDGF/PDGFR pairs that are known to functionally interact were identified in all of the samples . Interestingly , PDGF-C expression was ubiquitous in brain tumor cells and tissues but was very low or absent in normal adult and fetal brain . PDGF-D was expressed in 10 of 11 brain tumor cell lines and 3 of 5 primary brain tumor samples . As a strategy for blocking PDGFR signaling , CT52923 , a potent selective small molecule piperazinyl quinazoline kinase inhibitor of the PDGFR , was identified . In model systems using NIH/3T3 cells , CT52923 blocked PDGF autocrine-mediated phosphorylation of PDGFR , Akt , and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , while having no effect on v-fms or V12-ras-mediated Akt or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ( Erk ) phosphorylation . More importantly , p.o. administration of CT52923 to nude mice caused a significant 61% reduction ( P < 0.006 ) in tumor growth of NIH/3T3 cells transformed by PDGF , whereas tumor formation by cells expressing v-fms was unaffected . We next characterized PDGF autocrine signaling in five glioblastoma cell lines . In all of the cases , PDGF autocrine signaling was evident because treatment with 1-10 microM CT52923 inhibited PDGFR autophosphorylation when present at a detectable level and blocked downstream Akt and/or Erk phosphorylation . The functional significance of PDGF autocrine signaling in these cells was demonstrated by the fact that the CT52923 inhibited soft agar colony formation , and , when given p.o. to nude mice , it effectively reduced tumor formation by 44% ( P < 0.0019 ) after s.c. injection of C6 glioblastoma cells . This study of glioblastoma cells and primary tissues is the first to implicate PDGF-C and -D in brain tumor formation and confirms the existence of autocrine signaling by PDGF-A and -B . More importantly , treatment with the PDGFR antagonist CT52923 inhibited survival and/or mitogenic pathways in all of the glioblastoma cell lines tested and prevented glioma formation in a nude mouse xenograft model . Together these findings demonstrate the potential therapeutic utility of this class of compounds for the treatment of glioblastoma .
The relationship between thyroid hormone ( triiodothyronine , T(3) ) and breast cancer is unclear . We studied the effect of the c-erbA/TR alpha proto-oncogene encoding a functional T(3) receptor ( TR alpha 1 ) , of its ligand T(3) , and of its retroviral , mutated counterpart , the v-erbA oncogene , on the proliferation capacity of nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells ( EpH4 ) . We found that EpH4 cells expressing ectopically TR ( EpH4 + TR alpha 1 ) or v-erbA ( EpH4 + v-erbA ) proliferated faster than parental EpH4 cells that contained low levels of endogenous TR . T(3) inhibited DNA synthesis and proliferation in EpH4 + TR alpha 1 cells but not EpH4 or EpH4 + v-erbA cells . The study of cell-cycle genes showed that T(3) decreased cyclin D1 RNA and protein levels in EpH4 + TR alpha 1 cells . In addition , T(3) downregulated the expression of T1 , a gene that is overexpressed in human breast adenocarcinomas and is induced by mitogens , serum , and several oncogenes and cytokines . Inhibition of the T1 gene by T(3) required both de novo mRNA and protein synthesis . Furthermore , T(3) abolished the induction of T1 by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and inhibited the activity of an activation protein 1-dependent promoter ( -73-Col-CAT ) in EpH4 + TR alpha 1 cells , suggesting that interference with activation protein 1 transcription factor plays a part in the inhibition of the T1 gene . Our results showed that T(3) reduced the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells and inhibited the expression of cyclin D1 and T1 genes .
The metabolic detoxification capacity may critically regulate the susceptibility of human tissues to cancer development . We used standardized and quantitative , reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( StaRT-PCR ) and microarray chip techniques to analyze transcript levels of multiple detoxification enzymes in cultured normal human oral keratinocytes ( NOK ) and the Siman virus 40 T antigen-immortalized oral keratinocyte line SVpgC2a , viewing the latter as a model of a benign tumor state . With good agreement between the 2 methodologies , NOK and SVpgC2a were found to express transcripts for cytochrome P450 enzymes ( CYPs ) , factors related to CYP induction and enzymes involved in conjugation reactions or detoxification of reactive oxygen . The cell types expressed similar levels of CYP 2B6/7 , CYP 2E1 , P450 oxidoreductase , the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator , sulfotransferase 1A1 , sulfotransferase 1A3 , epoxide hydrolase , glutathione S-transferase M3 , glutathione S-transferase pi and catalase , superoxide dismutase 1 , glutathione peroxidase 1 and glutathione peroxidase 3 . In contrast , SVpgC2a exhibited comparatively higher levels of CYP1A1 , 1B1 , aryl hydrocarbon receptor , glutathione S-transferase M1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , glutathione S-transferase theta 1 and superoxide dismutase 2 and comparatively lower levels of UDP glycosyltransferase 2 and microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 . Some transcripts , e.g. , CYP 2A6/7 , were not detected by either standard , non quantitative RT-PCR or the above methods , whereas others were barely quantifiable by StaRT-PCR , i.e. , were present at 1-10 molecules/10(6) molecules of actin . Overall , the expression analysis demonstrated presence of mRNA for multiple enzymes involved in foreign compound metabolism and detoxification pathways , including several enzymes not previously reported for oral epithelium . Generally , the comparison of NOK from 2 individuals indicated relatively similar transcript levels of these enzymes . In contrast , differences between NOK and SVpgC2a , e.g. , for CYP1B1 , may reflect alteration caused by immortalization and aid identification of early stage tumor markers in oral epithelium .
Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( uPAR ) activates alpha5beta1 integrin and ERK signaling , inducing in vivo proliferation of HEp3 human carcinoma . Here we demonstrate that EGFR mediates the uPAR/integrin/fibronectin ( FN ) induced growth pathway . Its activation is ligand-independent and does not require high EGFR , but does require high uPAR expression . Only when uPAR level is constitutively elevated does EGFR become alpha5beta1-associated and activated . Domain 1 of uPAR is crucial for EGFR activation , and FAK links integrin and EGFR signaling . Inhibition of EGFR kinase blocks uPAR induced signal to ERK , implicating EGFR as an important effector of the pathway . Disruption of uPAR or EGFR signaling reduces HEp3 proliferation in vivo . These findings unveil a mechanism whereby uPAR subverts ligand-regulated EGFR signaling , providing cancer cells with proliferative advantage .
Epidemiological studies have indicated that females may be at greater risk of smoking associated lung cancer compared with males . Several lines of biochemical evidence support these observations . A possible role of circulating steroid hormones in the etiology of lung cancer has been hypothesized . In the present paper , we have studied the expression of the estrogen receptors ( ER)-alpha and ER beta in histologically normal human lung tissue and lung tumor cell lines . Relative ER mRNA levels were measured by reverse transcriptase-PCR and normalized to the level of expression of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene ( GAPDH ) . In lung tissue , an ER alpha transcript was found at various levels in 38 out of 46 cases ( 83% ) . ER beta was expressed in all cases . The ERs were expressed at similar levels in females and males , and the levels of ER alpha and ER beta mRNA were significantly related ( P<0.0001 ) . Compared with the lung tissue , ER expression levels were lower in 16 human lung tumor cell lines and two immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell lines . Five of the tumor cell lines ( 31% ) expressed detectable levels of ER alpha and both of the immortalized cell lines showed a weak ER alpha expression level . All cell lines expressed the ER beta . The lung cell lines BEAS-2B and DB354 showed significantly reduced cell proliferation in response to tamoxifen and a minor increased growth in response to 17 beta-estradiol . In conclusion , ER genes are abundantly expressed in both histologically normal human lung and lung tumor cell lines . This indicates a possible role of ERs in lung carcinogenesis .
Ovarian steroids are one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer . Sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG ) binds and transports sex steroids in the blood , regulating their bioavailable fraction and access to target cells . It can also inhibit the estradiol-induced proliferation of breast cancer cells through its membrane receptor . Three coding-region polymorphisms , which lead to an amino acid change , have been reported . We studied the influence of these three polymorphisms on breast cancer risk in three different populations : Polish familial breast cancer cases , 27% of them carrying a BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation , Nordic familial and sporadic breast cancer cases . The reported G to A polymorphism in exon 1 was not found in the 423 analyzed samples . Instead , we found a C to T transition causing an arg to cys amino acid change within the same codon in one Polish breast cancer patient and her daughter . Both of them were heterozygotes for the exon 8 G to A polymorphism as well . They were diagnosed for bilateral breast cancer and carried a BRCA1 mutation ( 5382insC ) . Analysis of the tumor samples showed that they had lost the wild-type allele both at exons 1 and 8 of the SHBG gene . Analysis of the other Polish samples showed no correlation of the exon 8 polymorphism to breast cancer , bilateral breast cancer , BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations or age at diagnosis . No association of the exon 8 polymorphism with breast cancer in the Nordic familial or sporadic cases was found . The C to T polymorphism located in exon 4 was rare in all the studied populations ( overall allele frequency 0.011 ) . However , in each of the study populations there was a trend for a lower variant allele frequency in cancer cases than in controls . Variant allele frequency in all the breast cancer cases was significantly lower than in all the controls ( chi(2) = 5.27 , P-value 0.02 ; odds ratio = 0.23 , 95% confidence interval 0.05-0.84 ) .
The HOX11 gene encodes a homeodomain transcription factor that is essential for spleen development during embryogenesis . HOX11 is also leukaemogenic , both through its clinical association with childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia , and its ability to immortalize other haematopoietic cell lineages experimentally . To examine the pathological role of HOX11 in tumorigenesis , we constitutively expressed HOX11 cDNA in J2E murine erythroleukaemic cells , which are capable of terminal differentiation . Enforced HOX11 expression was found to induce a profound alteration in J2E cellular morphology and differentiation status . Our analyses revealed that HOX11 produced clones with a preponderance of less differentiated cells that were highly adherent to plastic . Morphologically , the cells overexpressing HOX11 were larger and had decreased globin levels , as well as a reduction in haemoglobin synthesis in response to erythropoietin ( EPO ) . Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed the immature erythroid phenotype imposed by HOX11 , with clones transfected with HOX11 demonstrating expression of the c-Kit stem cell marker , while retaining EPO receptor expression . Taken together , these results show that HOX11 alters erythroid differentiation , favouring a less mature progenitor-like stage . This supports the notion that disrupted haematopoietic cell differentiation is responsible for pre-leukaemic immortalization by the HOX11 oncoprotein .
Immunosuppression has been related to the incidence of tumor apparition , including endocrine tumors . The intrasplenic ovarian tumor ( luteoma ) is a typical benign endocrine tumor that develops under high gonadotropin stimulation and , from the immunological perspective , is located in a critical organ involved in immune response . To establish if immunosuppression could alter the development of this experimental tumor , the effects of cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and dexamethasone ( Dex ) were evaluated . After surgery , tumor-bearing and sham animals were kept without treatment for 4 weeks ; thereafter , they were distributed into CsA ( 25 mg/kg ) , Dex ( 0.1 mg/kg ) , or vehicle ( 75:25 castor oil:ethanol ) groups and were injected on alternate days for 50 days . Body weight was evaluated weekly . Animals were sacrificed after a jugular vein blood sample was obtained . Thymi were weighed . Tumors were measured and placed in formaline for histological studies . Serum luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , prolactin ( PRL ) , and estradiol were measured by radioimmunoassay . Hematological parameters were determined . CsA induced a significant decrease in survival rates both in tumor-bearing and sham animals ( P < 0.01 ) . Dex significantly impaired weight increase in both groups of animals . CsA induced a significant weight loss in sham animals , not observed in tumor-bearing animals . Dex induced thymus weight loss in both groups , whereas CsA induced thymus weight loss only in sham animals . Only Dex induced a decrease in lymphocyte number in both groups . CsA induced an increase in monocyte number only in sham animals . Treatments did not alter LH , FSH , or estradiol , whereas PRL was increased by CsA only in sham rats . Neither Dex nor CsA induced any significant variations in tumor volume , nor did they alter tumor histology . In addition , no visible metastases or alterations in other organs were observed . We conclude that , though immunological parameters were altered by the treatments , immunosuppressor drugs did not condition tumor development . In addition , tumors secrete one or more factor/s that counteract CsA effect .
The widespread use of synthetic musk fragrances and the resultant presence of these substances and their metabolites in the aquatic environment ( as well as their accumulation in human adipose tissue ) raises the question of whether musk fragrances display endocrine and in particular estrogenic activity . A variety of musk fragrances were tested using the E-screen assay . A statistically significant increase in proliferation rate of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells was detected for two nitro musks ( musk xylene , musk ketone ) , a major metabolite of musk xylene ( p-amino-musk xylene ) , and the polycyclic musk fragrance AHTN . This indicates that these substances do , in fact , demonstrate estrogenic activity . Coincubation with the antiestrogen tamoxifen showed that the increase in proliferation rate by the musk fragrances is estrogen receptor-mediated . It must be noted , however , that the effective estrogenic strength and estrogenic potency were low compared to 17 b-estradiol . The naturally occurring fragrance muscone from the group of macrocyclic musk fragrances , a group of substances that have not yet been well characterized in respect to their toxicological properties , has also been shown to be weakly estrogenically active in vitro . E-screen analysis showed that the nitro musk metabolites o-amino musk xylene and 2-amino-MK , the macrocyclic musk fragrances ethylene brassylate , ethylene dodecandioate , and cyclopentadecanolide , are not estrogenically active .
Mutations in the Nf2 tumor suppressor gene lead to tumor formation in humans and mice and cellular overproliferation phenotypes in Drosophila . The Nf2 encoded protein , merlin , shares close sequence similarity in its amino terminus to members of the band 4.1 family of membrane-cytoskeletal linkers . Similarities between merlin and this family suggest a role for merlin in regulating cytoskeletal function . However , the mechanism of the tumor suppressing activity of merlin is not yet understood . Mutational analysis of Nf2 in flies has led to the identification of a dominant-negative allele , which harbors mutations in the amino terminus of the protein . Here , we report that expression of a murine analog of this amino-terminal mutant of Nf2 leads to complete transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts in culture . Cells that express this Nf2 mutant allele display disruptions of the actin cytoskeleton , lack of contact inhibition of growth , and anchorage-independent growth . Finally , fibroblasts that express this mutant Nf2 allele form tumors when injected into nude mice .
p107 Links to cyclin A/CDK2 ( cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ) and cyclin E/CDK2 that are important cell cycle regulators . However , p107 expression remains unclear in almost all kinds of human solid tumours . To clarify the expression of p107 in colorectal tumours , 22 normal mucosae , 9 hyperplastic polyps , 60 adenomas , 198 primary carcinomas , 21 lymph-nodal metastases , and 10 hepatic metastases were immunohistochemically stained for p107 , cyclin A , cyclin E , CDK2 and Ki67 . Results were measured using labelling indices ( LIs). p107 LIs surpassed the highest value in normal tissues in six of nine hyperplastic polyps , 54 of 60 adenomas , 144 of 198 primary cancers , 13 of 21 nodal foci and three of 10 hepatic foci. p107 LIs also apparently rose from normal through hyperplasia and adenoma to early carcinoma . However , they declined in liver-metastatic foci , and in primary cancers showing large size , mucinous type , venous invasion , lymphatic invasion , poorly differentiated type , deep invasion , lymph-nodal metastasis , hepatic metastasis or advanced stage . Low p107 LIs were also linked to a poor survival , particularly in stage-III patients . As the p107 LI gradually rose , the CDK2 ( in primary cancers only ) , cyclin A , cyclin E and Ki67 LIs were elevated concurrently-in both adenomas and primary cancers . Thus , in colorectal tumours , p107 expression rises abnormally and gradually during carcinogenesis and then falls during invasion , and thereby probably perturbs the cell-cycle control and promotes carcinogenesis and invasion . Clinically , reduced p107 may indicate a poorer prognosis .
Cellular senescence , initially observed during subculturing of normal diploid fibroblasts , can also be induced by chronic exposure to cellular stress , such as UV light , oxidative stress , or DNA damaging agents . Here we demonstrate that stable expression of an activated form of MKK6 ( MKK6EE ) , a direct activator of the stress-induced p38(HOG) mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway , is sufficient for inducing features of senescence including a flattened , vacuolated , and irregular morphology , staining for acidic beta-galactosidase , and accumulation of age-associated pigments . Consistent with the senescent phenotype , p38(HOG) activation induces a G(1) cell cycle arrest , which is permanent and irreversible after 4 days . MKK6EE also induces biochemical features of senescence in a p38-dependent manner , including enhanced expression of p21(CIP) , a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor . Microarray analysis of MKK6EE cells showed a pattern of gene expression noted previously in Werner Syndrome and senescent fibroblasts . These results define p38(HOG) as an intracellular pathway that activates a senescence checkpoint in tumor cells and may play a role in Ras- or stress-induced senescence .
Malignant mesothelioma ( MM ) still remains a therapeutic and diagnostic problem to which new therapeutic perspectives are being continuously tried and tested . Three different primary cultures ( MMGe-1 , MES MM 98 , and MES 1 ) and one immortalized cell line ( MSTO 211 H ) of human MM were studied in order to evaluate the HER-2/neu expression . Three out of four cell lines showed a different level of c-erbB-2 expression , the highest being detected on the MSTO 211 H cell line ( fibroblastic phenotype ) , whereas MMGe-1 resulted negative . The effect of the anti-HER-2/neu antibody ( Trastuzumab ) alone , and in combination with cisplatin ( CDDP ) at different doses ( ranging from 0.1 to 100 microg/ml ) , was studied on all the c-erB-2 positive cell lines . Trastuzumab was able to inhibit cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner , with growth inhibition also obtained at low concentrations ( 0.1-1 microg/ml ) . Combined treatment with Trastuzumab ( 10 microg/ml ) and CDDP ( 1 microg/ml ) showed synergism . Our results were encouraging , and suggest a rationale for further investigations in a clinical setting .
Enhanced glycolysis represents a striking feature of cancers and can therefore serve to indicate a malignant transformation . We have developed a noninvasive , quantitative method to characterize tumor glycolysis by monitoring ( 13)C-labeled glucose and lactate with magnetic resonance spectroscopy . This method was applied in MCF7 human breast cancer implanted in the mammary gland of female CD1-NU mice and was further employed to assess tumor response to hormonal manipulation with the antiestrogen tamoxifen . Analysis of the kinetic data based on a unique physiological-metabolic model yielded the rate parameters of glycolysis , glucose perfusion , and lactate clearance in the tumor , as well as glucose pharmacokinetics in the plasma . Treatment with tamoxifen induced a twofold reduction in the rate of glycolysis and of lactate clearance but did not affect the other parameters . This metabolic monitoring can thus serve to evaluate the efficacy of new selective estrogen receptor modulators and may be further extended to improve diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer .
PD-1 is a receptor of the Ig superfamily that negatively regulates T cell antigen receptor signaling by interacting with the specific ligands ( PD-L ) and is suggested to play a role in the maintenance of self-tolerance . In the present study , we examined possible roles of the PD-1/PD-L system in tumor immunity . Transgenic expression of PD-L1 , one of the PD-L , in P815 tumor cells rendered them less susceptible to the specific T cell antigen receptor-mediated lysis by cytotoxic T cells in vitro , and markedly enhanced their tumorigenesis and invasiveness in vivo in the syngeneic hosts as compared with the parental tumor cells that lacked endogenous PD-L . Both effects could be reversed by anti-PD-L1 Ab . Survey of murine tumor lines revealed that all of the myeloma cell lines examined naturally expressed PD-L1 . Growth of the myeloma cells in normal syngeneic mice was inhibited significantly albeit transiently by the administration of anti-PD-L1 Ab in vivo and was suppressed completely in the syngeneic PD-1-deficient mice . These results suggest that the expression of PD-L1 can serve as a potent mechanism for potentially immunogenic tumors to escape from host immune responses and that blockade of interaction between PD-1 and PD-L may provide a promising strategy for specific tumor immunotherapy .
The G protein-coupled human gastrin-releasing peptide receptor ( hGRP-R ) is frequently found aberrantly expressed in human cancers of the colon , stomach , and lung , and its ligand-specific activation has been implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation . Here , we demonstrated hGRP-R activation stimulated sustained cyclic AMP response element binding protein ( CREB ) phosphorylation and transactivation in duodenal cancer cells through a protein kinase C and partially p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway . In contrast , intracellular calcium , ERK1/2 , protein kinase A , and PI3 kinase were not involved . This novel signaling mechanism might be of importance for regulation of CREB-dependent gene expression in human cancer expressing functional hGRP-R .
A cell line designated HUUCLEC was established from a human uterine cervical lymphoepithelial carcinoma obtained from a 61-year-old Japanese woman . The cell line has grown slowly without interruption and serial passages were successively carried out 60 times within 3 years . The cultured cells were spindle or round in shape , showing anaplastic and pleomorphic features , a pavement cell arrangement and multilayering without contact inhibition . The population doubling time of the HUUCLEC line was 72 hours while the chromosomal number varied widely and showed aneuploidy . The modal chromosomal number was stable at the triploid range and marker chromosomes were present ; the Ebstein-Barr virus was absent in the cultured cells .
Previous studies have shown that 6-methoxy-8-hydroxylaminoquinoline ( MAQ-NOH ) , an N-hydroxy metabolite of the antimalarial drug , primaquine , is a direct-acting hemolytic agent in rats . To investigate the mechanism underlying this hemolytic activity , the effects of hemotoxic concentrations of MAQ-NOH on rat erythrocyte sulfhydryl status , membrane lipids , skeletal proteins , and morphology have been examined . Treatment of rat erythrocytes with a TC(50) concentration of MAQ-NOH ( 350 microM ) caused only a modest and transient depletion of reduced glutathione ( GSH ) ( which was matched by modest increases in the levels of glutathione disulfide and glutathione-protein mixed disulfides . Lipid peroxidation , as measured by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and F(2)-isoprostane formation , was induced in a concentration-dependent manner by MAQ-NOH . However , the formation of disulfide-linked hemoglobin adducts on membrane skeletal proteins and changes in erythrocyte morphology were not observed . These data suggest that hemolytic activity results from peroxidative damage to the lipid of the red cell membrane and is not dependent on skeletal protein thiol oxidation . However , when red cell GSH was depleted ( >90% ) by titration with diethyl maleate , hemolytic activity of MAQ-NOH was markedly enhanced . Of interest , exacerbation of hemotoxicity was not matched by increases in lipid peroxidation , but by the appearance of hemoglobin-skeletal protein adducts . Collectively , the data are consistent with the concept that MAQ-NOH may operate by more than one mechanism ; one that involves lipid peroxidation in the presence of normal amounts of erythrocytic GSH , and one that involves protein oxidation in red cells with low levels of GSH , such as are seen in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency .
We showed in a previous study that soluble low-molecular-mass tumor-associated antigens ( sTAA ) promote the anti-tumor effect of the anticancer drug cyclophosphamide ( CPA ) on rat mammary carcinogenesis . In this report , we analyzed the possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon . Studies were performed on the bone marrow and thymus from the following groups of rats : i ) control rats , ii ) rats treated with sTAA , iii ) rats treated with CPA , iv ) rats treated with CPA and sTAA . The cellular content of the bone marrow and thymus ( CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes ) was analyzed morphometrically and immunohistochemically . In the bone marrow , CPA caused significant substitution of cellular components with fatty tissue whereas sTAA repaired this process . We found that CPA affects mainly the process of myelogenesis whereas sTAA protect the production of lymphocytes . In the thymus , CPA alone or in combination with sTAA repaired the inhibition effect of DMBA on synthesis of CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes. sTAA further increased the amount of CD8+ T lymphocytes in the medulla of the thymus . Data in the literature as well as the findings presented here demonstrate that the tested treatment , including vaccination with sTAA , actively promotes the generation of the host's antitumor immune response .
OBJECT The intracellular events transducing mitogenic signals from platelet-derived growth factor-beta ( PDGFbeta ) receptor tyrosine kinases are not precisely known . In this study the authors evaluated whether the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-K)-Akt-p70S6K pathway is expressed in meningiomas , regulates their growth , and transduces mitogenic signals of PDGF-BB . METHODS Nine meningioma tumors obtained in humans were evaluated using Western blot analysis for phosphorylated ( activated ) Akt and phosphorylated p70S6K . Cells cultured from seven of these meningiomas were also screened using Western blot analysis for Akt and for phosphorylated Akt and p70S6K . The authors also evaluated whether PDGF-BB stimulation of meningioma cells was associated with the phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K known to activate these kinases . In addition , the effects of wortmannin , an inhibitor of P13-K , on proliferation and activation of Akt and p70S6K in meningioma cells stimulated with PDGF-BB were evaluated . Western blots of lysates from meningiomas demonstrated phosphorylated Akt and p70S6K . Treatment with PDGF-BB stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K in each meningioma cell culture . Wortmannin ( 500 and 1000 nM ) significantly decreased PDGF-BB stimulation of meningioma cells ( p < 0.001 ) while it reduced Akt and p70S6K phosphorylation but not mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( MAPK/ERK ) phosphorylation . CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that Akt and p70S6K are constitutively expressed and activated in meningioma cells and that the PI3-K-Akt-p70S6K pathway may participate in transduction of mitogenic signals in meningiomas independent of the Raf-1-MEK-1-MAPK/ERK cascade .
It is still difficult to decide on the treatment modalities for advanced esophageal carcinoma when the prognostic factors of T4 esophageal cancer are not fully understood . In this article , we report that among 71 patients with T4 thoracic esophageal cancer , 49 underwent esophagectomy , 9 had curative resection ( R0 group ) , and 40 had palliative resection ( R1/2 group ) . A total of 22 patients had palliative treatments : bypass in 5 ( bypass group ) , gastrostomy or jejunostomy in 6 ( stoma group ) , and radiochemotherapy alone in 11 ( nonoperation group ) . Clinicopathologic characteristics were retrospectively investigated . Treatment-related deaths occurred in 7 ( 10% ) : none in R0 , 3 ( 8% ) in R1/2 , 3 ( 60% ) in bypass , and 1 ( 17% ) in stoma group . Swallowing was improved in 50 ( 70% ) patients : 9 ( 100% ) in R0 , 30 ( 75% ) in R1/2 , 1 ( 20% ) in bypass , 3 ( 50% ) in stoma , and 7 ( 64% ) in the nonoperation group . One- , two- , and three-year overall survival rates were 56% , 22% , and 22% in the R0 group and 35% , 19% and 6% in the R1/2 group , respectively ( p = 0.19 ) . In the bypass , stoma , and nonoperation groups , none survived 1.6 years . The factors influencing the survival rate of the 49 patients undergoing esophagectomy were grade of lymph node metastasis , amount of perioperative blood transfusion , lymph vessel , and blood vessel invasion . Among these , independent prognostic factors for survival were amount of blood transfusion ( -6 units vs. -7 units , p <0.0001 ) and grade of lymph node metastasis [ none- or peritumoral [ lymph nodes adjacent to the main tumor or at a nearby location ( <3 cm ) from the tumor ] metastasis vs. more distant metastasis [ lymph nodes at a distant location ( > 3 cm) ] , p = 0.016 ] . Bypass and stoma operation neither prolonged the survival nor improved the difficulty of swallowing compared with radiochemotherapy alone . Esophagectomy can achieve the best improvement of swallowing and the longest survival with an acceptable mortality rate . Esophageal carcinoma patients with T4 disease and distinct metastasis in the lymph nodes at a distant location ( >3 cm ) from the primary tumor may not benefit from an esophageal resection .
A key issue in the development of the central nervous system ( CNS ) is understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating cell number . The present study examines the role of CD81 ( previously known as TAPA , the target of the antiproliferative antibody ) in the control of brain size and glial cell number . CD81 is a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins . This group of small membrane proteins is associated with the regulation of cell migration and mitotic activity . Glial cells express CD81 , and antibodies directed against this protein suppress the mitotic activity of cultured cells . In this study , we examine the effects of the CD81 -/- mutation on the CNS of mature mice . These mice have extremely large brains , as much as 30% larger than the brains of wild-type ( +/+ ) littermates . The increase in brain weight is accompanied by an increase in the number astrocytes and microglia , whereas the number of neurons and oligodendrocytes in the CD81 -/- animals appears to be normal . When the CD81 -/- mutation is placed on different genetic backgrounds , there is a remarkable range in the penetrance of the null allele phenotype , demonstrating that the mutation can be affected by modifier loci . This work provides support for the role of CD81 in the regulation of astrocyte and microglial number , perhaps by regulating cell proliferation by a contact inhibition-dependent mechanism .
We used cDNA-based genomic microarrays to examine DNA copy number changes in a panel of prostate tumors and found a previously undescribed amplicon on chromosome 17 containing a novel overexpressed gene that we termed prostate cancer gene 17 ( PRC17 ) . When overexpressed in 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells , PRC17 induced growth in low serum , loss of contact inhibition , and tumor formation in nude mice . The PRC17 gene product contains a GTPase-activating protein ( GAP ) catalytic core motif found in various Rab/Ypt GAPs , including RN-Tre . Similar to RN-Tre , we found that PRC17 protein interacts directly with Rab5 and stimulates its GTP hydrolysis . Point mutations that alter conserved amino acid residues within the PRC17 GAP domain abolished its transforming abilities , suggesting that GAP activity is essential for its oncogenic function . Whereas PRC17 is amplified in 15% of prostate cancers , it is highly overexpressed in approximately one-half of metastatic prostate tumors . The potent oncogenic activity of PRC17 is likely to influence the tumorigenic phenotype of these prostate cancers .
Hormone-independent tumor growth and metastasis are associated with increased mortality in human prostate cancer . In this study , we evaluate a potential role for ligand-mediated activation of HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase in androgen-independent prostate cancers . HER2 , HER3 , and epidermal growth factor receptor were detected in the androgen-independent cell line 22Rv1 . Heregulin stimulation results in receptor phosphorylation and cell proliferation that is inhibited by increasing concentrations of anti-HER2 recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody ( rhuMAb ) 2C4 . Furthermore , inhibition of tumor growth was observed in xenografts derived from 22Rv1 cells when treated with rhuMAb 2C4 in a dose-dependent manner . These studies provide a framework , both in vitro and in vivo , to examine the molecular mechanisms of ligand-driven HER2 activation in androgen-independent tumorigenesis .
We have previously reported the frequent occurrence of bile duct invasion by liver metastases from colorectal cancer . We found that patients with macroscopic intrabiliary cancer growth survive longer after hepatectomy than those without this feature . In the present study , we analyzed the clinicopathological features of primary colorectal cancer showing macroscopic intrabiliary extension of liver metastases . We reviewed 217 patients who underwent initial hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastasis between 1992 and 1998 , and analyzed the corresponding primary colorectal cancers clinicopathologically . Microscopic bile duct invasion was found in 89 of 217 cases ( 40.6% ) and , of these cases , 23 ( 10.6% ) had macroscopic intrabiliary extension . Histological sections of the corresponding primary colorectal cancer were available in eight ( group A ) of these 23 cases . These were compared with 20 cases , selected randomly , of colorectal cancer that did not show bile duct invasion and were diagnosed as liver metastases . These patients underwent hepatectomy during the same period as group A and were used as a control ( group B ) . The histology of the primary tumors revealed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma in 100% of group A and in 25% of group B. The average maximum diameter of the primary tumor was 5.32 cm in group A and 3.61 cm in group B. Venous invasion was detected in 25% of group A and in 90% of group B ( P < 0.01 ) , while the incidences of lymphatic vessel invasion and lymph node metastases were similar between the groups . These data suggest that macroscopic intrabiliary extension could be a good indicator of a unique subgroup of colorectal cancers showing less aggressive features even though they develop liver metastases . Careful histological evaluation is important even for metastatic tumors .
Antithymocyte globulin is widely used before haematopoietic transplantation with HLA-matched unrelated donors or mismatched relatives to prevent rejection and graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . However , optimal dosage is still under debate . Thirty-one consecutive children , mainly with haematological malignancies , were transplanted in a single institution with such donors , selected by HLA-A -B compatibility by serology and DRB1* by DNA typing . Antithymocyte globulin ( Thymoglobuline ; Sangstat ) was infused at days -3 , -2 , -1 . Total dosage varied : 16 patients received a median of 7.5 mg/kg ( 2.5 to 10.5 : low-dose group ) , and 15 a median of 15.5 mg/kg ( 14.4 to 19.4 : high-dose group ) . Post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine , short-course methotrexate and steroids . CD3(+) , CD4(+) and CD19(+) cell reconstitution was slower in the high-dose group . Median time to reach 100 CD4(+) cells was 8 months vs 4 months ( P = 0.03 ) . Median time to normal CD19(+) cells was 16 months vs 8 months ( P = 0.01 ) . CD16(+)CD56(+) and CD8(+) cell reconstitution was similar . Nine patients in the high-dose group and two in the low-dose group experienced life-threatening opportunistic infections ( P = 0.009 ) . Although obtained from a limited number of patients , our data suggest that a higher pre-graft dose of antithymocyte globulin may negatively influence immune reconstitution .
A hallmark of cancer cells is the ability to proliferate indefinitely . This acquisition of an immortal lifespan usually requires the activation of telomerase , the enzyme that elongates telomeres . Human telomerase is minimally composed of the reverse transcriptase subunit hTERT , and the RNA subunit hTR . While hTR is ubiquitously expressed in human cells , the hTERT subunit is generally transcriptionally repressed in most normal somatic cells , but is illegitimately activated to restore telomerase activity in cancer cells . Indeed , in the thousands of different human tumours assayed , 85% were scored positive for telomerase activity . However , the levels of telomerase activity detected in tumour samples can vary substantially and even some normal somatic cells have been found to have low levels of enzyme activity . As the functional significance of low levels of telomerase activity is unclear , we investigated whether there is a minimum level of telomerase activity required for tumourigenesis . Using mutants of hTERT that induce varying levels of telomerase activity , we show that there does indeed exist a threshold of activity required for the processes of immortalization , transformation and tumourigenesis . Thus , low levels of activity detected in certain somatic cells would not be expected to contribute to tumourigenesis , nor does the mere detection of telomerase in cancer cells necessarily signify an immortal lifespan .
Environmental carcinogen exposure may play an important role in the incidence of cancer in children . In addition to environmental pollutants , maternal smoking during pregnancy may be a contributing factor . Major carcinogenic components of cigarette smoke and other combustion by-products in the environment include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) . Mouse offspring exposed during midpregnancy to the PAH , benzo[a]pyrene ( B[a]P ) , show significant deficiencies in their immune functions , observed in late gestation which persist for at least 18 months . Tumor incidences in these progeny are 8 to 10-fold higher than in controls . We have demonstrated a significant reduction in thymocytes ( CD4+ CD8+ , CD4+ CD8+ Vbeta8+ , CD4+ CD8+ Vgamma2+ ) from newborn and splenocytes ( CD4+ CD8+ ) from 1-week-old mouse progeny exposed to B[a]P in utero . To investigate possible causes of the observed T cell reduction , we analyzed the thymocytes and splenocytes from progeny and maternal tissues for the presence of B[a]P-DNA adducts . Adducts were detected in maternal , placental and offspring lymphoid tissues at day 19 of gestation , at birth and 1-wk after birth . The presence of B[a]P-DNA adducts in immature T cells may , in part , explain the previously observed T cell immunosuppression and tumor susceptibility in mice exposed to B[a]P in utero . The effects of DNA lesions on progeny T cells may include interference with normal T-cell development . These results provide a possible explanation for the relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy and childhood carcinogenesis .
Retinoic acid ( RA ) and its derivatives inhibit the proliferation of normal human mammary epithelial cells ( HMEC ) and some breast carcinoma lines by mechanisms which are not fully understood . To identify genes that mediate RA-induced cell growth arrest , an HMEC cDNA library was synthesized and subtractive screening was performed . We identified the interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) gene as an RA induced gene in HMEC . Northern blot analyses showed that the IL-1beta gene was up-regulated as early as 2 h after RA treatment . Results from the treatment of HMEC with cycloheximide and actinomycin D indicated that the regulation of the IL-1beta gene by RA occurred at the transcriptional level and that the IL-1beta gene is a direct , downstream target gene of RA . To evaluate the effects of IL-1beta on cell proliferation , the proliferation of HMEC was measured in the presence of RA or IL-1beta , or both . Either RA or IL-1beta could significantly inhibit the proliferation of HMEC . However , the addition of soluble IL-1 receptor antagonist ( sIL-1ra ) to the cell culture medium did not block RA-induced HMEC growth inhibition , whereas sIL-1ra did block the growth inhibition of HMEC by IL-1beta . IL-1beta expression was not observed in the three carcinoma cell lines , MCF-7 , MDA-MB-231 , and MDA-MB-468 , as compared to the HMEC . Growth curves of the breast carcinoma cell lines showed strong inhibitory effects of RA and IL-1beta on the growth of the estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive MCF-7 cell line , but only a small effect on the ER negative MDA-MB-231 cells . The expression of the IL-1beta gene was also transcriptionally activated by RA in normal epithelial cells of prostate and oral cavity . Our results suggest that : ( a ) the IL-1beta gene is a primary target of RA receptors in HMEC ; ( b ) the enhanced expression of the IL-1beta gene does not mediate the RA-induced growth arrest of HMEC ; and ( c ) the expression of the IL-1beta gene is low or absent in all three human breast carcinoma cell lines examined , but the defect in the IL-1beta signaling pathway may be different in ER positive versus ER negative carcinoma cells .
Genetic immunotherapy with tumor antigen gene-modified dendritic cells ( DC ) generates robust immunity , although antitumor protection is not complete in all models . Previous experience in a model in which C57BL/6 mice immunized with DC transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing MART-1 demonstrated a 20-40% complete protection to a tumor challenge with B16 melanoma cells . Tumors that did develop in immunized mice had slower growth kinetics compared to tumors implanted in na<FFFD>ve mice . In the present study , we wished to determine if the supraphysiological production of the Th1-skewing cytokine interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) could enhance immune activation and antitumor protection in this model . In a series of experiments immunizing mice with DC cotransduced with MART-1 and IL-12 , antitumor protection and antigen-specific splenocyte cytotoxicity and interferon gamma production inversely correlated with the amount of IL-12 produced by DC . This adverse effect of IL-12 could not be explained by a direct cytotoxic effect of natural killer cells directed towards DC , nor the production of nitric oxide leading to down-regulation of the immune response - the two mechanisms previously recognized to explain immune-suppressive effects of IL-12-based vaccine therapy . In conclusion , in this animal model , IL-12 production by gene-modified DC leads to a cytokine-induced dose-dependent inhibition of antigen-specific antitumor protection .
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) is the most potent tumor promoter ever tested in rodents . Although it is known that most of TCDD actions are mediated by binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) , the mechanisms leading to tumor promotion still remain to be elucidated . Loss of contact inhibition is one characteristic hallmark in tumorigenesis . In rat liver epithelial WB-F344 cells , TCDD induces a release from contact inhibition , which is manifested by a twofold increase in cell number when TCDD ( 1 nM for 48 h ) is added to confluent cells in the presence of serum , but not when given to exponentially growing or subconfluent , serum-deprived WB-F344 cells . Loss of G1 arrest was also shown by flow cytometric analysis . We demonstrate that TCDD treatment significantly increases cyclin D2 and cyclin A protein levels and show by immunofluorescence that these proteins accumulate in the nucleus . Although TCDD treatment leads to a strong increase in cyclin D2/cdk4 and cyclin A/cdk2 complex formation , we could only detect an elevation of cyclin A/cdk2 activity . In accordance with a lack of elevated cdk4 activity , no decrease in the amount of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein could be shown after TCDD treatment . The importance of increased cyclin A/cdk2 activity for TCDD-dependent release from contact inhibition was shown by the fact that the cdk2/cdc2-specific inhibitor olomoucine ( 25 microM ) abolished TCDD response . These data indicate cyclin A-dependent loss of G1 arrest after TCDD treatment mainly downstream of the retinoblastoma protein .
Retinoblastoma ( Rb ) is the most common intraocular tumor of childhood . In this study we examined primary Rb specimens and Rb cell lines for the expression of immunoglobulin superfamily ( IgSF ) antigens : MHC class I and II ( MHC-I and MHC-II ) , neural cell adhesion molecule ( NCAM ) , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , and Thy-1 , which play an important role in immune system and tumor cell interactions . MHC-I and-II , ICAM-1 ( CD54 ) , NCAM ( CD56 ) , and Thy-1 ( CDw90 ) immunoreactivity was studied in eight primary Rb biopsy specimens using immunohistochemistry , three using immunoelectron microscopy , and six Rb cell lines using flow cytometry ( FCM ) . Parenchymal and vascular-associated cells , phenotypically similar to retinal microglia , strongly expressed MHC-II immunoreactivity and were distributed throughout primary Rb specimens . However , MHC-II expression on Rb cell lines was similar to nonspecific control levels . Tumor cells in primary Rb specimens displayed high NCAM , moderate Thy-1 , and low MHC-I and ICAM-1 immunolabeling . Tumor vasculature expressed low to moderate MHC-I and ICAM-1 immunoreactivity and moderate Thy-1 immunoreactivity . NCAM was not detected on the vasculature of primary Rb specimens . Rb cell lines displayed variable expression of Thy-1 , ICAM-1 , and MHC-I . NCAM was highly expressed on five of six Rb cell lines . The high levels of constitutive NCAM immunoreactivity on Rb tumor cells confirm the neuroectodermal origins of this tumor . Additionally , the variable expression of Thy-1 may suggest separate neural lineages or differences in the maturational status ofsome Rb tumors . The presence of a population of infiltrating MHC-II-positive cells in primary Rb tumors has implications for immunomodulation of Rb growth .
Binding of erythropoietin ( EPO ) to its receptor ( EPOR ) on erythroid cells induces the activation of numerous signal transduction pathways , including the mitogen-activated protein kinase Jun-N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) . In an effort to understand the regulation of EPO-induced proliferation and JNK activation , we have examined the role of potential autocrine factors in the proliferation of the murine erythroleukemia cell line HCD57 . We report here that treatment of these cells with EPO induced the expression and secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) . EPO-dependent proliferation was reduced by the addition of neutralizing antibodies to TNF-alpha , and exogenously added TNF-alpha induced proliferation of HCD57 cells . EPO also could induce TNF-alpha expression in BAF3 and DA3 myeloid cells ectopically expressing EPOR . Addition of TNF-alpha activated JNK in HCD57 cells , and the activity of JNK was partially inhibited by addition of a TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody . Primary human and murine erythroid progenitors expressed TNF-alpha in either an EPO-dependent or constitutive manner . However , TNF-alpha had an inhibitory effect on both immature primary human and murine cells , suggestive that the proliferative effects of TNF-alpha may be limited to erythroleukemic cells . This study suggests a novel role for autocrine TNF-alpha expression in the proliferation of erythroleukemia cells that is distinct from the effect of TNF-alpha in normal erythropoiesis .
Prognosis of patients with non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) remains difficult to assess , even after adjustment for pathological stage . Prognostic value of numerous biological markers has been evaluated , with conflicting results . Data of 86 patients with NSCLC treated by surgery were collected with clinical characteristics , histopathological data including tumor differentiation and status of blood and lymphatic vessel invasion and evaluation by immunohistochemistry of Rb , Bcl-2 and Ki-67 expression . Prognostic values for overall survival ( OS ) and event-free survival ( EFS ) were analyzed by the log tank test and the multivariable Cox model . Using univariable analyses , pT , pN , poor differentiation or large cell subtype were associated with a poor OS , while lymphatic and/or blood vessel invasion were associated with a short EFS . None of the molecular markers had a significant prognostic value for either outcome . In multivariable analyses , only stage remained of prognostic value for OS . Interestingly , the presence of blood vascular invasion in the tumor was significantly predictive for subsequent metastatic occurrence in stages I and II . This feature might , therefore , be relevant for administration of adjuvant therapy in completely resected NSCLC .
Hormone replacement therapy , which is a common menopausal treatment , is contraindicated in women with breast cancers due to concerns regarding the potential for breast cell proliferation . As such , there is a need for alternative methods for treating menopausal symptoms . To determine the influence of one such alternative , black cohosh ( Cimicifuga racemosa [ CR] ) , on estrogen-dependent mammary cancers , we conducted an in vitro investigation of the effect of an isopropanolic CR-extract on the proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells . The experiments were performed using the human breast adenocarcinoma ( MCF-7 ) cell test system , an established in vitro model for estrogen-dependent tumors . The influence of CR-extract on the proliferation of the MCF-7 cells was determined by measuring the incorporation of radioactively labeled thymidine . Under estrogen-deprived conditions , the CR-extract ( 10(-3)-10(-5) dilutions ) significantly inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation . Additionally , application of the CR-extract inhibited estrogen-induced proliferation of MCF-7 cells . Moreover , the proliferation-inhibiting effect of tamoxifen was enhanced by the CR-extract . Such data that suggest a non-estrogenic , or estrogen-antagonistic effect of CR on human breast cancer cells lead to the conclusion that CR treatment may be a safe , natural remedy for menopausal symptoms in breast cancer .
INTRODUCTION AND AIMS The survival of pancreatic cancer patients with portal vein resection is extremely poor due to the high incidence of liver metastasis . The occurrence of liver metastasis is decreased by locoregional arterial infusion after pancreatic surgery . Chemosensitivity tests can provide the basis for individualized chemotherapy in each patient and predict the clinical response . Therefore , the current study was designed to clarify whether locoregional chemotherapy based on the results of chemosensitivity tests has the clinical effects of preventing liver metastasis and improving survival for patients with portal vein resection . METHODOLOGY The resected specimens from 40 of 47 patients with resection of pancreatic cancer were assessed for chemosensitivity to various anticancer drugs . Fourteen patients underwent portal vein resection due to direct invasion , and nine of these patients received intra-arterial adjuvant chemotherapy on the basis of the results of MTT assay to prevent liver metastasis . The remaining five patients received no chemotherapy . RESULTS None of the patients who received intra-arterial chemotherapy had liver metastasis , and this group of patients had improved survival . The mean survival of patients with intra-arterial chemotherapy was significantly longer than that of patients without chemotherapy ( 25.6 months with chemotherapy versus 9.4 months without chemotherapy ) . CONCLUSION A pilot study of postoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy showed the reduction of liver metastasis and improvement of survival among pancreatic cancer patients with portal vein resection .
beta-Defensins are small antimicrobial peptides of the innate immune system produced in response to microbial infection of mucosal tissue and skin . We demonstrate that murine beta-defensin 2 ( mDF2beta ) acts directly on immature dendritic cells as an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR-4 ) , inducing up-regulation of costimulatory molecules and dendritic cell maturation . These events , in turn , trigger robust , type 1 polarized adaptive immune responses in vivo , suggesting that mDF2beta may play an important role in immunosurveillance against pathogens and , possibly , self antigens or tumor antigens .
BACKGROUND A retrospective study was performed to determine the indications for positron emission tomography ( PET ) using [ (18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) in patients with esophageal cancer , including those with early cancer , and to investigate whether the tumor-to-normal ratio ( T/N ratio ) could be used as a substitute for the standardized uptake value ( SUV ) . METHODS Thirty-six patients were included in the study . Thirty-one patients who had 36 biopsy-proven lesions ( 35 squamous cell carcinomas and one small cell carcinoma ) underwent PET study prior to treatment . PET images were evaluated visually and the relationship between the depth of invasion and the PET findings were examined in 22 lesions of 19 patients from whom specimens were obtained from the primary tumor by surgery or endoscopic mucosal resection . PET results were also compared with computed tomography ( CT ) and endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) for detection of regional lymph node metastases in 18 patients who underwent extended lymph node dissection . Five patients underwent PET studies for the detection of recurrence and the PET findings were compared with their CT findings . The T/N ratio and the SUV were calculated for 20 primary tumors . RESULTS Among the 15 tumors that were pT1b or greater , all 15 were positive on PET and all seven of the lesions confined to the mucosa ( Tis or T1a ) were negative . The sensitivity , specificity and accuracy of detecting nodal involvement were , respectively , 37.5 , 96.1 and 88.3% by CT , 30.8 , 88.5 and 81.0% by EUS and 41.7 , 100 and 92.2% by PET . More sites of recurrence were detected by PET than by CT . There was no statistically significant correlation between the SUV and the T/N ratio . CONCLUSIONS PET imaging can detect primary esophageal cancer with a depth of invasion of T1b or greater , but Tis and T1a tumors are undetectable . PET seems to be more accurate than CT or EUS for diagnosing lymph node metastasis . The T/N ratio cannot be used as a substitute for the SUV .
The INK4a/ARF tumor suppressor locus is implicated in the senescence-like growth arrest provoked by oncogenic Ras in primary cells . INK4a and ARF are distinct proteins encoded by transcripts in which a shared exon is decoded in alternative reading frames . Here we analyze dermal fibroblasts ( designated Q34 ) from an individual carrying independent missense mutations in each copy of the common exon . Both mutations alter the amino acid sequence of INK4a and functionally impair the protein , although they do so to different degrees . Only one of the mutations affects the sequence of ARF , causing an apparently innocuous change near its carboxy terminus . Unlike normal human fibroblasts , Q34 cells are not permanently arrested by Ras or its downstream effectors Ets1 and Ets2 . Moreover , ectopic Ras enables the cells to grow as anchorage-independent colonies , and in relatively young Q34 cells anchorage independence can be achieved without addition of telomerase or perturbation of the p53 pathway . Whereas ARF plays the principal role in Ras-induced arrest of mouse fibroblasts , our data imply that INK4a assumes this role in human fibroblasts .
During papillomavirus infection , the E5 protein localizes in the cell Golgi apparatus and other endomembrane compartments . Cells transformed by E5 do not express major histocompatibility class I complex ( MHC I ) on the cell surface , while cells transformed by the other transforming proteins E6 and E7 do . In addition , the total amount of both MHC I protein and mRNA is reduced in E5-transformed cells . Here we show that expression of bovine papillomavirus E5 causes the retention of MHC I in the Golgi apparatus , thus preventing its transport to the cell surface . We ascribe this effect to a failure of acidification of the Golgi apparatus , as similar effects are observed in control cells treated with the ionophore monensin . Treatment of E5-transformed cells with either beta- or gamma-interferon increases the synthesis of MHC I , showing that inhibition of MHC I expression by E5 is not irreversible . However , even after interferon treatment , MHC I , although increased in quantity , is not transported to the cell surface . E5 therefore affects MHC I at several levels , but prevention of MHC I transport to the cell surface appears to be the dominant effect . Lack of surface MHC I would have profound consequences for presentation of viral peptides to the immune system .
Using standard culture conditions , primary human mammary epithelial cells ( HMECs ) undergo a premature , transient growth arrest termed M0 ( mortality stage 0 ) after 10-15 population doublings in vitro . It has been reported that emergence from this growth arrest by the abrogation of p16(INK4a) , a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , and expression of the catalytic component of human telomerase ( hTERT ) are necessary for HMEC immortalization . Here we show that primary HMECs , grown on feeder layers , do not undergo this growth arrest and can be immortalized without abrogating p16 . These findings support the concept that the so-called M0 stage represents a cell culture stress-induced growth arrest and that hTERT is sufficient to immortalize HMECs when cultured under adequate conditions .
Annexin II is secreted into the extracellular environment , where , via interactions with specific proteases and extracellular matrix proteins , it participates in plasminogen activation , cell adhesion , and tumor metastasis and invasion . However , mechanisms regulating annexin II transport across the cellular membrane are unknown . In this study , we used coimmunoprecipitation to show that Annexin-II was bound to insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) receptors in PC12 cells and NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing insulin ( NIH-3T3(IR) ) or IGF-1 receptor ( NIH-3T3(IGF-1R) ) . Stimulation of insulin and IGF-1 receptors by insulin caused a temporary dissociation of annexin II from these receptors , which was accompanied by an increased amount of extracellular annexin II detected in the media of PC12 , NIH-3T3(IR) , and NIH-3T3(IGF-1R) cells but not in that of untransfected NIH-3T3 cells . Activation of a different growth factor receptor , the platelet-derived growth factor receptor , did not produce such results . Tyrphostin AG1024 , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of insulin and IGF-1 receptor , was shown to inhibit annexin II secretion along with reduced receptor phosphorylation . Inhibitors of a few downstream signaling enzymes including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , pp60c-Src , and protein kinase C had no effect on insulin-induced annexin II secretion , suggesting a possible direct link between receptor activation and annexin II secretion . Immunocytochemistry revealed that insulin also induced transport of the membrane-bound form of annexin II to the outside layer of the cell membrane and appeared to promote cell aggregation . These results suggest that the insulin receptor and its signaling pathways may participate in molecular mechanisms mediating annexin II secretion .
A large number of human cancers display alterations in the Ink4a/cyclin D/Cdk4 genetic pathway , suggesting that activation of Cdk4 plays an important role in oncogenesis . Here we report that Cdk4-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts are resistant to transformation in response to Ras activation with dominant-negative ( DN ) p53 expression or in the Ink4a/Arf-null background , judged by foci formation , anchorage-independent growth , and tumorigenesis in athymic mice . Cdk4-null fibroblasts proliferate at normal rates during early passages . Whereas Cdk4(+/+)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) cells are immortal in culture , Cdk4(-/-)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) cells undergo senescence during continuous culture , as do wild-type cells . Activated Ras also induces premature senescence in Cdk4(-/-)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) cells and Cdk4(-/-) cells with DNp53 expression . Thus , Cdk4 deficiency causes senescence in a unique Arf/p53-independent manner , which accounts for the loss of transformation potential . Cdk4-null cells express high levels of p21(Cip1/Waf1) with increased protein stability . Suppression of p21(Cip1/Waf1) by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , as well as expression of HPV-E7 oncoprotein , restores immortalization and Ras-mediated transformation in Cdk4(-/-)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) cells and Cdk4(-/-) cells with DNp53 expression . Therefore , Cdk4 is essential for immortalization , and suppression of Cdk4 could be a prospective strategy to recruit cells with inactive Arf/p53 pathway to senescence .
Alterations of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene are common in some forms of cancer and the most frequent is a deletion of exons 2-7 . We have previously shown that this mutant receptor , called DeltaEGFR , confers enhanced tumorigenicity to glioblastoma cells through elevated proliferation and reduced apoptotic rates of the tumor cells in vivo . To understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie DeltaEGFR-enhanced proliferation , we examined the gene products that control cell cycle progression . We found that levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor , p27 , were lower in U87MG.DeltaEGFR tumors than in parental U87MG or control U87MG.DK tumors . Consequently , CDK2-cyclin A activity was also elevated , concomitant with the RB protein hyperphosphorylation . In addition , activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-K ) and phosphorylated Akt levels were also elevated in the U87MG.DeltaEGFR tumors . U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells failed to arrest in G(1) in response to serum starvation in vitro and while maintaining high levels of PI3-K activity and hyperphosphorylated RB . Treatment of U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells with LY294002 , a PI3-K inhibitor , caused reduced levels of phosphorylated Akt and concomitantly up-regulated levels of p27 . Expression of a kinase dead dominant-negative Akt mutant in the U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells similarly resulted in up-regulation of p27 and down-regulation of tumorigenicity in vivo . These results suggest that the constitutively active DeltaEGFR can enhance cell proliferation in part by down-regulation of p27 through activation of the PI3-K/Akt pathway . This pathway may represent another therapeutic target for treatment of those aggressive glioblastomas expressing DeltaEGFR .
Whole body hyperthermia ( WBH ) has been used as an adjunct to radio-/chemotherapy in patients with various malignant diseases . Although clear evidence is still missing , it has been hypothesized that an activation of the immune system might contribute to the therapeutic effect of WBH . To examine whether a treatment with 60-minute 41.8 degrees C WBH as an adjunct to chemotherapy ( WBH-CT ) induces an activation of T cells , blood samples were collected at numerous time points before and up to 48 h post-treatment . The aim of this study was to examine the effect of WBH-CT on the expression of a broad range of activation markers on peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) , on serum cytokines and intracellular cytokine levels in T cells , and the capacity of these cells to proliferate . Immediately after 41.8 degrees C WBH-CT treatment , a drastic increase in peripheral natural killer ( NK ) cells ( P<0.05 ) and CD56+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ; P<0.01 ) in the patients ' peripheral blood was observed . At 5 h post-treatment , the percentages of both effector cell types had returned to baseline levels . This transient phenomenon was accompanied by a short period of reduced T cell activity , indicated by diminished serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptors ( sIL-2R ) at 3 h post-WBH-CT ( P<0.05 ) and decreased lymphocytic proliferation at the same point in time . This first phase was followed by a marked but short-lived increase in the patients ' serum levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ; P<0.01 ) during the first 5 h following treatment , with a subsequent decrease to baseline levels at 24 h and significantly increased serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) at 0 h ( P<0.01 ) , 3 h ( P<0.05 ) , 5 h ( P<0.05 ) and 24 h ( P<0.01 ) post-WBH-CT . The third phase of the immunological consequences of WBH-CT consisted of an increase in the percentage of peripheral cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) expressing CD56 , reaching a maximum at 48 h post-WBH ( P<0.01 ) . Furthermore , the percentage of CD4+ T cells expressing the T cell activation marker CD69 increased nearly two-fold over time , reaching its maximum at 48 h ( P<0.05 ) . As an additional marker for T cell activation , serum levels of sIL-2R increased markedly ( P<0.01 ) , reaching maximum levels at the same point in time . Elevated intracellular concentrations of interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) and/or TNF-alpha in CD8+ T cells were found in 4 out of 5 patients at 24 h post-WBH-CT . Since similar changes were not observed in patients receiving chemotherapy alone , this is the first study to provide evidence for prolonged WBH-CT-induced activation of human T cells .
AIM To investigate the progressive transformation of immortal cells of human fetal esophageal epithelium induced by human papillomavirus , and to examine biological criteria of sequential passage of cells , including cellular phenotype , proliferative rate , telomerase , chromosome and tumorigenicity . METHODS The SHEE cell series consisted of immortalized embryonic esophageal epithelium which was in malignant transformation when cultivated over sixty passages without co-carcinogens . Cells of the 10th , 31st , 60th and 85th passages were present in progressive development after being transfected with HPV . Cells were cultivated in a culture flask and 24-hole cultural plates . Progressive changes of morphology , cell growth , contact-inhibition , and anchorage-dependent growth characteristics were examined by phase contrast microscopy . The cell proliferation rate was assayed by flow cytometry . The modal number of chromosomes was analyzed . HPV18E(6)E(7) was detected by Western blot methods and activities of telomerase were analyzed by TRAP . Tumorigenicity of cells was detected with soft agar plates cultivated and with tumor formation in SCID mice . RESULTS In morphological examination the 10th passage cells were in good differentiation , the 60th and 85th passages cells were in relatively poor differentiation , and the 31st passage cells had two distinct differentiations . The characteristics of the 85th and 60th passage cells were weakened at contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth . Karyotypes of four stages of cells belonged to hyperdiploid or hypotriploid , and bimodal distribution of chromosomes appeared in the 31st and 60th passage cells . All of these characteristics combined with a increasing trend . The activities of telomerase were expressed in the latter three passages . Four fourths of SCID mice in the 85th passage cells and one fourth of SCID mice in the 60th passage cells developed tumors , but the cells in the 10th and 31st passage displayed no tumor formation . CONCLUSION In continual cultivation of fetal esophageal epithelial cells with transduction of HPV18E(6)E(7) , cells from the 10th to the 85th passage were changed gradually from preimmortal , immortal , precancerous to malignantly transformed stages . All of these changes were in a dynamic progressive process . The establishment of a continuous line of esophageal epithelium may provide a in vitro model of carcinogenesis induced by HPV .
We report the formation , detection , quantitation and structural characterization of products resulting from the adduction of deoxynucleosides ( deoxyadenosine , deoxyguanosine , deoxycytidine and 5-methyldeoxycytidine ) to the catechol estrogens ( CE ) of estrone , estradiol-17beta and estradiol-17 alpha . The crude products are obtained in a one-pot synthesis through oxidation of catechols to quinones and subsequent Michael-type reaction with the deoxynucleosides in acidic medium . In all experiments , adducts are detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis after HPLC separation ( LC/ESI/MS(n) ) . The two pyrimidines deoxycytidine and 5-methyldeoxycytidine yield only CE adducts to deoxynucleosides , which correspond to stable adducts on DNA . For purines , the results depend on the CE ( 2,3- or 3,4-catechols ) used , the function and configuration on carbon 17 ( ketone for estrone , alcohol for alpha and beta isomers of estradiol ) , and on the purine itself ( deoxyadenosine or deoxyguanosine ) . Both stable adducts and deglycosylated adducts are formed , and therefore formation of stable adducts on DNA as well as the loss of purines from the DNA strands could be possible . MS(2) and MS(3) experiments prove to be relevant for further structural determinations , enabling in some cases the elucidation of the regiochemistry of adduction on the A and B rings of the steroid moiety .
Deregulation of D-type cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDK4 and 6 ) is widely observed in various human cancers , illustrating their importance in cell cycle control . Like other cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ) , assembly with cyclins is the most critical step for activation of CDK4/6 . As previously reported elsewhere , we observed that the level of cyclinD1-CDK4 complex and its associated kinase activity were significantly low in asynchronously proliferating mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking both p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) ( p21/p27-null MEFs ) . These evidences imply that p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) CDK inhibitors are ' essential activators ' of cyclin D-kinases . We , however , discovered here that both the assembly and activation of cyclin D1-CDK4 complex occur when quiescent p21/p27-null MEFs were stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle . This mitogen-induced cyclin D1-kinase activity was blocked by overexpression of p16(INK4a) and resulted in the inhibition of S phase entry in p21/p27-null MEFs . Furthermore , ectopic expression of p34(SEI-1) , a mitogen-induced CDK4 binding protein , increased the levels of active cyclinD1-CDK4 complex in asynchronously proliferating p21/p27-null MEFs . Together , our results suggest that there are several independent ways to stimulate the assembly of cyclin D1-CDK4 kinases . Although p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) play a role in this process , our results demonstrate that additional mechanisms must occur in G0 to S phase transition .
The ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation present in sunlight is immune-suppressive . Recently we showed that solar-simulated UV radiation ( UVA + UVB ; 295-400 nm ) , applied after immunization , suppressed immunological memory and the elicitation of delayed-type hypersensitivity to the common opportunistic pathogen , Candida albicans . Further , we found that wavelengths in the UVA region of the solar spectrum ( 320-400 nm ) , devoid of UVB , were equally effective in activating immune suppression as UVA + UVB radiation . Here we report on the mechanisms involved . No immune suppression was found in UV-irradiated mice injected with monoclonal anti-interleukin ( IL)-10 antibody , or mice exposed to solar-simulated UV radiation and injected with recombinant IL-12 . Antigen-specific suppressor T cells were found in the spleens of mice exposed to UVA + UVB radiation . Applying liposomes containing bacteriophage T4N5 to the skin of mice exposed to solar-simulated UVA + UVB radiation or mice exposed to UVA radiation blocked immune suppression , demonstrating an essential role for UV-induced DNA damage in the suppression of established immune reactions . These findings indicate that UV radiation activates similar immunological pathways to suppress the induction , or the elicitation , of the immune response .
Rho GTPases are signaling molecules known to control cell motility . Several recent studies have suggested a role for Rho proteins in mediating tumor metastasis independent of their affects on cell proliferation . As Rho proteins require post-translational modification with a geranlygeranyl moiety for full activity , we tested the affect of blocking geranylation on localization , downstream signaling , and stimulation of invasion . Expression of a constitutively active Rho construct in A375 melanoma cells dramatically stimulated invasion through Matrigel membranes ; however , a constitutively active RhoA mutated so that it cannot be geranylated , failed to stimulate invasion . Moreover , expression of epitope or GFP tagged modifications of this nongeranylatable constitutively active Rho demonstrated that geranylation is necessary for correct cellular localization of Rho . Geranylation was also found to be necessary for full downstream activation of serum response factor mediated transcription . Pharmacologic inhibition of Rho geranylation produced similar inhibition of Rho localization , signaling , and invasion . Our results suggest that inhibition of Rho geranylation may be an attractive pharmacologic target for inhibiting melanoma metastasis .
To assess the immune function of microglia and macrophages in brain tumors , the expression of MHC class II and B7 costimulatory molecules in three rodent glioma models was examined . Microglia and macrophages , which accounted for 5-12% of total cells , expressed B7.1 and MHC class II molecules in the C6 and 9L tumors , but not RG2 gliomas . Interestingly , the expression of B7.1 and MHC class II molecules by microglia and macrophage was associated with an increase in the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in C6 and 9L tumors . B7.2 expression , which was present at low levels on microglia and macrophages in normal brain , did not significantly change in tumors . Interestingly , the expression of all three surface antigens increased after microglia were isolated from intracranial C6 tumors and cultured for a short period of time . We conclude that microglia immune activity may be suppressed in gliomas and directly correlates to the immunogenecity of experimental brain tumors .
BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE Altered cell adhesion has a critical role in the development of epithelial cancers . E-cadherin act on the maintenance of cell-cell adhesion and its function was thought to be regulated by associated cytoplasmic proteins , such as alpha-catenin and beta-catenin . This study was designed to examine the expression of beta-catenin in gastric carcinoma and to determine the relationship between tumor characteristics and survival . METHODS Immunohistochemical staining of beta-catenin and E-cadherin was performed in 148 patients with gastric carcinoma . RESULTS Abnormal expression of beta-catenin and E-cadherin was performed in 148 patients with gastric carcinoma . RESULTS Abnormal expression of beta-catenin and E-cadherin was demonstrated in 43.2% and 44.6% of tumors respectively . Up to 63% of tumors stained abnormally for one or two components of the cadherin-catenin complex ( beta-catenin , E-cadherin ) . Abnormal beta-catenin and E-cadherin staining occurred more frequently in poor differentiated tumor than in good differentiated tumors ( P < 0.005 , respectively ) . There was a significant correlation between abnormal beta-catenin expression and depth of invasion(P < 0.025 ) . Moreover , abnormal beta-catenin expression was more frequent in tumors with positive lymph node metastasis ( 45/84 , 53.6% ) and distance metastasis(21/31 , 67.7% ) than in tumors without lymph node metastasis ( 19/64 , 29.7% ) ( P < 0.005 ) and distance metastasis ( 43/117 , 36.8% ) ( P < 0.005 ) . A survival advantage was noted in tumors retaining normal membranous expression of beta-catenin , independent of type , grade , or stage ( P < 0.005 ) . CONCLUSIONS Abnormal expression of the E-cadherin-catenin complex occurs frequently in gastric carcinoma . The close correlation with poor survival suggests that abnormal beta-catenin may be a useful prognostic marker .
We identified REDD1 as a novel transcriptional target of p53 induced following DNA damage . During embryogenesis , REDD1 expression mirrors the tissue-specific pattern of the p53 family member p63 , and TP63 null embryos show virtually no expression of REDD1 , which is restored in mouse embryo fibroblasts following p63 expression . In differentiating primary keratinocytes , TP63 and REDD1 expression are coordinately downregulated , and ectopic expression of either gene inhibits in vitro differentiation . REDD1 appears to function in the regulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) ; we show that TP63 null fibroblasts have decreased ROS levels and reduced sensitivity to oxidative stress , which are both increased following ectopic expression of either TP63 or REDD1 . Thus , REDD1 encodes a shared transcriptional target that implicates ROS in the p53-dependent DNA damage response and in p63-mediated regulation of epithelial differentiation .
PURPOSE The roles of terminal sialyl and fucosyl residues in cell surface glycans in the metastatic potential of H7721 cells , a human hepatocarcinoma cell line , were studied . METHODS Neuraminidase and alpha-L-fucosidase were used to remove the sialyl and fucosyl residues , respectively . Cell adhesion to fibronectin ( Fn ) , laminin ( Ln ) , and human umbilical vein epithelial cell ( HUVEC ) , as well as chemotactic cell migration and invasion , were selected as the parameters of metastatic potential ex vivo . RESULTS Sialyl residue is not essential for cell adhesion to Fn , but is important in cell adhesion to Ln and invasion , and is crucial in cell adhesion to HUVEC and migration . In contrast , fucosyl residue contributes more than sialyl residue to cell adhesion to Fn and Ln , but less to adhesion to HUVEC , and is not essential in chemotactic cell migration and invasion . Cell adhesion to HUVEC , migration , and invasion were inhibited by the monoclonal antibody of sialyl Lewis X , but not by the antibody of non-sialyl Lewis X. CONCLUSION Terminal sialyl residues on cell surface glycans are more important than fucosyl residues in mediating cell adhesion to HUVEC and cell migration/invasion , but the reverse is true in cell adhesion to Fn and Ln .
Animal studies indicate that the immune system is one of the most sensitive targets of the toxic effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-p-dibenzodioxin ( TCDD ) . TCDD inhibits immunoglobulin secretion and decreases resistance to bacterial , viral , and parasitic infections in exposed animals . Nearly 20 years after the Seveso , Italy , accident , we measured immunoglobulin and complement plasma levels in a random sample of the population in the most highly exposed zones ( n = 62 ) and in the surrounding noncontaminated area ( n = 58 ) . Plasma IgG levels decreased with increasing TCDD plasma concentration ( r = -0.35 , p = 0.0002 ) . Median IgG concentration decreased from 1,526 mg/dL in the group with the lowest ( < 3.5 ppt ) TCDD levels to 1,163 mg/dL in the group with the highest ( 20.1-89.9 ppt ) TCDD levels ( p = 0.002 ) . The association was significant ( p = 0.0004 ) after adjusting for age , sex , smoking , and consumption of domestic livestock and poultry in multiple regression analysis and persisted after exclusion of subjects with inflammatory diseases and those using antibiotics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . IgM , IgA , C3 , and C4 plasma concentrations did not exhibit any consistent association with TCDD levels . We performed a systematic review of all the articles published between 1966 and 2001 on human subjects exposed to TCDD reporting information on circulating levels of immunoglobulins and/or complement components . The literature indicates that the evidence for effects of TCDD on humoral immunity is sparse . Methodologic issues , results , and possible sources of variation between studies are discussed . The possible long-term immunologic effects of TCDD exhibited by the participants of the present study , coupled with the increased incidence of lymphatic tumors in the area of the accident , warrant further investigation .
During mitotic exit , a small GTPase Tem1 needs to be activated . During most of the cell cycle , Tem1 activity is antagonized by a GTPase activating complex ( GAP ) composed of Bub2 and Bfa1 . Bfa1 protein has cell cycle regulated phosphorylation depending upon the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 . This phosphorylation dissociates Bfa1 from Tem1 and thus relieves the inhibition of Tem1 by the GAP complex . Bub2 and Bfa1 are also required to prevent mitotic exit when there is DNA damage , spindle damage or spindle misorientation at G(2)/M phase . While Cdc5 inhibits Bfa1/Bub2 , mutating the Cdc5 phosphorylation sites on Bfa1 does not have a strong activating effect on Bub2/Bfa1 , suggesting there must be additional regulation in this pathway . Here we report that Bub2 protein also has cell cycle regulated phosphorylation . This phosphorylation is partially dependent upon the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 and is consistent with negative regulation of the Bub2/Bfa1 GAP complex . Spindle damage or spindle misorientation prevents Bub2 phosphorylation . The spindle damage effect is dependent upon the spindle assembly checkpoint components Mad2 and Mps1 . Thus like Bfa1 , Bub2 protein is also controlled both during mitotic exit and in response to cell cycle checkpoints . Bub2 phosphorylation is likely to be controlled by a novel kinase .
Prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) receptor subtype EP(2) , which is coupled to cAMP metabolism , is known to mediate proliferation of primary human keratinocytes in vitro . The effect of gain or loss of EP(2) receptors in immortalized human keratinocytes ( HaCat cells ) was examined . HaCat keratinocytes were transfected with sense or anti-sense constructs of the EP(2) receptor . Loss or gain of EP(2) expression was documented by immunoblot and associated changes in agonist-stimulated cAMP production . Loss or gain of EP(2) receptor expression correlated with alterations in plating efficiencies but with modest affects on growth . When cell lines were studied in an organ culture model , anti-sense clones were highly invasive compared with vector controls and sense transfectants . A marked increase in prostaglandin production is commonly seen in malignant lesions . Because prostaglandin receptors are known to undergo ligand-induced receptor down-regulation , we sought to determine whether EP(2) receptor down-regulation results in increased invasiveness . In vector controls , invasiveness was reproduced by ligand-dependent EP(2) receptor down-regulation as assessed by immunohistochemistry . In addition , loss of EP(2) receptor expression was associated with decreased paxillin expression , a critical component of focal adhesion assembly . Thus , down-regulation of EP(2) receptors represents a potential mechanism for neoplastic progression to an invasive phenotype .
The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of sequence variants in the class I beta-tubulin ( clone m40 ) gene and their occurrence in human tumors and cancer cell lines . DNA was isolated from 93 control individuals representing a wide variety of ethnicities , 49 paclitaxel-naive specimens ( 16 ovarian cancers , 17 non-small cell lung cancers , and 16 ovarian cancer cell lines ) , and 30 paclitaxel-resistant specimens ( 9 ovarian cancers , 9 ovarian cancer cell lines , and 12 ovarian cancer xenografts in nude mice ) . Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequence analysis detected two silent polymorphisms in exon 4 , Leu217Leu ( CTG/CTA ) and Gly400Gly ( GGC/GGT ) , with minor allele frequencies of 17 and 0.5% , respectively . Five nucleotide substitutions and one single-base deletion were detected in introns 1 , 2 , and 3 and in the 3 ' untranslated region . Analysis of 49 paclitaxel-naive and 30 paclitaxel-resistant specimens revealed no additional polymorphisms in the coding region . In addition , no amino acid replacements were found in chimpanzee , gorilla , and orangutan in comparison to human . Our data demonstrate a very high degree of sequence conservation in class I beta-tubulin , suggesting that all residues are important in tubulin structure and function . Individual variation in response to treatment with paclitaxel is not likely to be caused by genetic variations in the beta-tubulin drug target . Moreover , acquired mutations in class I beta-tubulin are unlikely to be a clinically relevant cause of drug resistance .
The signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT)1 is a cytoplasmic-transcription factor that is phosphorylated by Janus kinases ( Jak ) in response to interferon gamma(IFN-gamma) . The phosphorylated STAT1 translocates to the nucleus , where it turns on specific sets of IFN-gamma-inducible genes , such as the interferon regulatory factor ( IRF)-1 . We show here that gamma irradiation reduces the IFN-gamma mRNA expression . The inhibition of the STAT1 phosphorylation and the IRF-1 expression by gamma irradiation was also observed . In contrast , the mRNA levels of IL-5 and transcription factor GATA-3 were slightly induced by gamma irradiation when compared to the non-irradiated sample . Furthermore , we detected the inhibition of cell-mediated immunity by gamma irradiation in the allogenic-mixed lymphocytes ' reaction ( MLR ) . These results postulate that gamma irradiation induces the polarized-Th2 response and interferes with STAT1 signals , thereby causing the immunosuppression of the Th1 response .
4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal ( HNE ) , a major racemic product of lipid peroxidation , reacts with histidine to form a stable HNE-histidine Michael addition-type adduct possessing three chiral centers in the cyclic hemiacetal structure . In the present study , we characterized configurational isomers of a HNE-N(alpha)-acetylhistidine adduct by NMR spectroscopy and by molecular orbital calculations . In addition , we raised monoclonal antibodies against ( R)-HNE-histidine and ( S)-HNE-histidine adducts , characterized their specificities , and examined in vivo localizations of each adduct under oxidative stress . To facilitate structural characterization of the configurational isomers of an HNE-histidine adduct , we prepared the ( R)-HNE-histidine and ( S)-HNE-histidine adducts by incubating N(alpha)-acetylhistidine with each HNE enantiomer , both of which provided two peaks ( Ra and Rb from ( R)-HNE-histidine and Sa and Sb from ( S)-HNE-histidine adducts ) in reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography . The NMR analysis showed that each peak was a mixture of two diastereomers . In addition , the analysis of the nuclear Overhauser effect enabled the determination of configurations of the eight isomers . The relative amounts of these isomers in the NMR analysis correlated with the relative energies calculated by molecular orbital methods . On the other hand , using ( R)-HNE-modified and ( S)-HNE-modified keyhole limpet hemocyanins as the antigens , we raised the monoclonal antibodies , mAbR310 and mAbS412 , which enantioselectively recognized the ( R)-HNE-histidine and ( S)-HNE-histidine adducts , respectively . Among the mixtures ( Ra , Rb , Sa , and Sb ) of diastereomers , mAbR310 showed the highest immunoreactivity to Rb ( the mixture of 2R,4S,5R and 2S,4S,5R isomers ) , whereas mAbS412 preferentially recognized Sa ( the mixture of 2R,4S,5S and 2S,4S,5S isomers ) . The presence of ( R)-HNE and ( S)-HNE epitopes in vivo was immunohistochemically examined in the kidney of rats exposed to the renal carcinogen , ferric nitrilotriacetate , by which nuclear and cytosolic stainings with mAbR310 and mAbS412 , respectively , were detected .
Transfected linear DNA molecules are substrates for double-strand break ( DSB ) repair in mammalian cells . The DSB repair process can involve recombination between the transfected DNA molecules , between the transfected molecules and chromosomal DNA , or both . In order to determine whether these different types of repair events are linked , we devised assays enabling us to follow the fate of linear extrachromosomal DNA molecules involved in both interplasmid and chromosome-plasmid recombination , in the presence or absence of a pre-defined chromosomal DSB . Plasmid-based vectors were designed that could either recombine via interplasmid recombination or chromosome-plasmid recombination to produce a functional beta-galactosidase ( betagal ) fusion gene . By measuring the frequency of betagal+ cells at 36 h post-transfection versus the frequency of betagal+ clones after 14 days , we found that the number of cells containing extrachromosomal recombinant DNA molecules at 36 h ( i.e. , betagal+ ) , either through interplasmid or chromosome-plasmid recombination , was nearly the same as the number of cells integrating these recombinant molecules . Furthermore , when a predefined DSB was created at a chromosomal site , the extrachromosomal recombinant DNA molecules were shown to integrate preferentially at that site by Southern and fiber-FISH ( fluorescence in situ hybridization ) analysis . Together these data indicate that the initial recombination event can potentiate or commit extrachromosomal DNA to integration in the genome at the site of a chromosomal DSB . The efficiency at which extrachromosomal recombinant molecules are used as substrates in chromosomal DSB repair suggests extrachromosomal DSB repair can be coupled to the repair of chromosomal DSBs in mammalian cells .
The ability of p53 to alter , at the transcriptional level , the gene expression of downstream targets is critical for its role as a tumor suppressor . Most models of p53 activation postulate the stepwise recruitment by p53 of coactivators , histone acetyltransferases , and/or chromatin remodeling factors to a promoter region to facilitate the subsequent access of the general transcriptional machinery required for transcriptional induction . We demonstrate here , however , that the promoter regions for the p53 target genes , p21 , 14-3-3sigma , and KARP-1 , exist in a constitutively open conformation that is readily accessible to DNase I. This conformation was not altered by DNA damage or by whether p53 was present or absent in the cell . In contrast , p53 response elements , which resided outside the immediate promoter regions , existed within DNase I-resistant chromatin domains . Thus , p53 activation of downstream target genes occurs without p53 inducing chromatin alterations detectable by DNase I accessibility at either the promoter or the response element . As such , these data support models of p53 activation that do not require extensive chromatin alterations to support cognate gene expression .
Tumor metastasis represents a complex multistep process that requires migration , invasion , and angiogenesis . In this study , we examined the impact of molecular blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor on the invasive and metastatic capacity of human squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the head and neck using in vitro and in vivo model systems . Treatment with the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody C225 attenuated the migration of SCC-1 tumor cells through a chemotaxis chamber in a dose-dependent manner . Incubation of SCC cells with 10-100 nM C225 for 4 h resulted in 40-60% inhibition of cell migration . Furthermore , in the presence of C225 , the capacity of SCC-1 to invade across a layer of extracellular matrix ( Matrigel ) was significantly inhibited . Using an in vivo orthotopic floor-of-mouth xenograft model , locoregional tumor invasion of SCC-1 into muscle , vessel , bone , and perineural tissues was inhibited in C225-treated mice . This inhibition was additionally characterized by down-regulation in the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 . These data suggest that inhibition of metastatic potential by C225 may be mediated via decreased migration and invasion of SCC cells . Regarding angiogenesis in vitro , we first studied human umbilical vascular endothelial cells , which established a capillary-like network structure ( tube formation ) in the presence of reconstituted Matrigel . Treatment with C225 reduced cell-to-cell interaction of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells , resulting in disruption of tube formation . The effect of C225 was additionally examined using an in vivo tumor xenograft neovascularization model of angiogenesis . Systemic treatment with C225 not only reduced tumor growth and the number of blood capillaries but also hindered the growth of established vessels toward the tumor . Taken together , these results provide evidence that C225 can suppress tumor-induced neovascularization and metastasis in SCC of the head and neck .
A number of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs designed to have cytotoxic actions on tumor cells have recently been shown to also have antiangiogenic activities . Endothelial cell migration and proliferation are key components of tumor angiogenesis , and agents that target the microtubule cytoskeleton can interfere with these processes . In this study , the effect on endothelial cell functions of the microtubule-stabilizing drugs Taxotere and Taxol were evaluated in three in vitro assays : a chemokinetic migration assay , an angiogenesis factor-mediated chemotactic migration assay , and a three-dimensional Matrigel tubule formation assay , using rat fat pad endothelial cells ( RFPECs ) and/or human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . Taxotere was active in all three assays at concentrations that were not cytotoxic and did not inhibit endothelial cell proliferation . In the RFPEC chemokinetic migration and in vitro tubule formation assays , the IC50 values were approximately 10(-9) M for both Taxotere and Taxol . HUVEC migration , however , was more sensitive to Taxotere , with an observed IC50 of 10(-12) M in a chemokinetic assay . In a Boyden chamber assay , HUVEC chemotaxis stimulated by either of two angiogenic factors , thymidine phosphorylase or vascular endothelial growth factor , was inhibited by Taxotere with an IC50 of 10(-11) M and was ablated at 10(-9) M. Taxotere was also up to 1000-fold more potent than Taxol in inhibiting either chemokinetic or chemotactic migration . When the microtubule cytoskeleton was visualized using immunofluorescence staining of alpha-tubulin , there were no gross morphological changes observed in HUVECs or RFPECs treated with Taxotere at concentrations that inhibited endothelial cell migration but not proliferation . The effects of Taxotere on migration were associated with a reduction in the reorientation of the cell's centrosome , at concentrations that did not affect gross microtubule morphology or proliferation . Reorientation of the centrosome , which acts as the microtubule organizing center , in the intended direction of movement is a critical early step in the stabilization of directed cell migration . These data indicate that endothelial cell migration correlates more closely with changes in microtubule plasticity than with microtubule gross structure . The antiangiogenic activity of Taxotere in vivo was assessed in a Matrigel plug assay . In this assay , the angiogenic response to fibroblast growth factor 2 was inhibited in vivo by Taxotere with an ID50 of 5.4 mg/kg when injected twice weekly over a 14-day period , and angiogenesis was completely blocked in mice that received 10 mg/kg Taxotere . The in vivo data further suggested that Taxotere had selectivity for endothelial cell migration and/or microvessel formation because infiltration of inflammatory cells into the Matrigel plug was much less sensitive to inhibition by Taxotere . In conclusion , Taxotere is a potent and potentially specific inhibitor of endothelial cell migration in vitro and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo .
Approximately 10% of the U.S. population ingests <50% of the current recommended daily allowance for zinc . We investigate the effect of zinc deficiency on DNA damage , expression of DNA-repair enzymes , and downstream signaling events in a cell-culture model . Low zinc inhibited cell growth of rat glioma C6 cells and increased oxidative stress . Low intracellular zinc increased DNA single-strand breaks ( comet assay ) . Zinc-deficient C6 cells also exhibited an increase in the expression of the zinc-containing DNA-repair proteins p53 and apurinic endonuclease ( APE ) . Repletion with zinc restored cell growth and reversed DNA damage . APE is a multifunctional protein that not only repairs DNA but also controls DNA-binding activity of many transcription factors that may be involved in cancer progression . The ability of the transcription factors p53 , nuclear factor kappaB , and activator protein 1 ( AP1 ) to bind to consensus DNA sequences was decreased markedly with zinc deficiency , as assayed by electrophoretic mobility-shift assays . Thus , low intracellular zinc status causes oxidative DNA damage and induces DNA-repair protein expression , but binding of p53 and important downstream signals leading to proper DNA repair are lost without zinc .
Ovarian hormones have a pivotal role in the control of proliferation in the mammary gland , and cumulative life-time exposure to ovarian hormones is known to be a determinant of breast cancer risk . We have shown previously that a p.o.-active , long-acting butyrate analogue , sodium phenylbutyrate ( PB ) , reduced proliferation in normal and malignant human breast cells in culture and reduced expression of ovarian hormone receptors , suggesting that PB had cellular effects consistent with decreasing breast cancer risk . The aim of this study was to determine the in vivo effects of PB in the normal mammary gland on epithelial cell proliferation , estrogen receptor alpha ( ER alpha ) expression , and cyclin D1 expression . BALB/c mice were treated with PB , delivered by mini-osmotic pumps , for 7 days . Moderate ( 250 mg/kg/day ) and high ( 500 mg/kg/day ) PB treatment resulted in a decrease in proliferation in mammary epithelial cells ( P < 0.001 ) , determined by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation . Analysis of ER alpha immunostaining revealed a significant reduction in moderate- and high-treatment groups ( P = 0.01 and P = 0.02 ) , and expression of cyclin D1 was virtually ablated ( P < 0.001 ) . Histone deacetylase inhibition is a known mechanism of butyrate action , and consistent with this , PB increased levels of acetylated histone H3 in the mammary gland . In summary , PB decreased proliferation in the mammary gland in vivo at clinically achievable doses . Decreased proliferation was accompanied by changes in the levels of ER alpha and cyclin D1 . These data show that PB modulates parameters thought to be involved in the carcinogenic process in the normal mammary gland , and compounds in this class may therefore be useful candidates for breast cancer chemoprevention .
Although there have been numerous studies of site-specific mutagenesis by dGuo adducts of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxides ( B[a]P DEs ) , the present study represents the first example of site-specific mutagenesis by dGuo adducts of the highly carcinogenic benzo[c]phenanthrene 3,4-diol 1,2-epoxides ( B[c]Ph DEs ) . The eight adducts that would result from cis- and trans-opening at C-1 of four optically active isomers of B[c]Ph DEs by the N(2)-amino group of dGuo were incorporated into 5'-TTCGAATCCTTCCCCC ( context III ) and 5'-GGGGTTCCCGAGCGGC ( context IV ) at the underlined site . These modified oligonucleotides along with unmodified controls were ligated into single-stranded M13mp7L2 , which were then used to transfect SOS-induced Escherichia coli . Upon replication of the lesions in each of the two sequence contexts , mutational analysis of the progeny was performed by differential hybridization . For the 16 adducts , the mutation frequencies varied over 2 orders of magnitude with a reasonably even distribution ( 0.4-1% for three adducts , 1-2% for six adducts , 3-7.4% for five adducts , and one adduct each at 11 and 39% ) . For all but this last adduct , the mutation frequency for a given B[c]Ph DE adduct was less than for its B[a]P analogue with the same stereochemistry in the same sequence . For the vectors containing adducts with S configuration at the site of attachment of the hydrocarbon to the dGuo base , the main base substitution was G --> T followed by G --> A. In contrast , for the vectors containing adducts with R configuration , the main base substitution was G --> A. The most notable observation in the present study is the low frequency of mutations induced by the B[c]Ph DE-dGuo adducts relative to their B[a]P counterparts . A possible structural basis for this difference is proposed .
BACKGROUND/PURPOSE Although angiogenic factors may play an important role in the biology of neuroblastoma , which frequently spreads hematogenously , the mechanism remains unclear . The authors studied tumor progression and invasion from the perspective of angiogenesis and sought to understand the features of this type of tumor . METHODS Thirty-one specimens were resected from patients with neuroblastoma and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , and its receptor ( Flk-1 ) was examined using immunohistochemistry . The authors looked for correlations among the expressions of VEGF and its receptor with various clinicopathologic factors . In addition , they examined the expression and location of VEGF and Flk-1 mRNA in 10 primary neuroblastoma using in situ hybridization . RESULTS Both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed the presence of VEGF expression within the neuroblastoma cells . We found VEGF mRNA in neuroblastoma cells but not vascular endothelial cells according to in situ hybridization . Further , Flk-1 mRNA was present both in neuroblastoma cells and vascular endothelial cells . The level of VEGF expression was higher in unfavorable histology , using the criteria of Shimada , than in favorable histology . CONCLUSION The authors suggest that paracrine and autocrine systems are involved in the angiogenesis of neuroblastoma , and the expression of VEGF correlates with the prognosis in neuroblastoma .
We investigated the effectiveness of continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion ( CHPP ) for the peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer . A total 124 patients with advanced gastric cancer were enrolled in this study . Prophylactic CHPP ( P-CHPP ) was performed in 45 patients who had macroscopic serosal invasion without peritoneal dissemination , and 79 patients without CHPP were a control group . Therapeutic CHPP ( T-CHPP ) was performed in 21 patients with peritoneal dissemination , and 52 patients without CHPP were a control group . There was no significant difference in 5 year survival between patients treated and not treated with P-CHPP . Univariate analysis showed that location of tumor , tumor diameter , and lymph node metastasis influenced prognosis , but there was no prognostic factor in the Cox proportional regression hazard model . There was no significant difference in 5-year survival between patients treated and not treated with T-CHPP . Univariate analysis showed that degree of peritoneal dissemination and adjuvant chemotherapy influenced prognosis , and the Cox proportional regression hazard model showed that the macroscopic types and degree of peritoneal dissemination affected prognosis . In the patients with CHPP , the incidences of respiratory failure and renal failure were each statistically greater than in the patients undergoing CHPP .
Ionizing radiation is a potent inducer of DNA damage because it causes single- and double-strand breaks , alkali-labile sites , base damage , and crosslinks . The interest in ionizing radiation is due to its environmental and clinical implications . Single-strand breaks , which are the initial damage induced by a genotoxic agent , can be used as a biomarker of exposure , whereas the more biologically relevant double-strand breaks can be analyzed to quantify the extent of damage . In the present study the effects of 137CS gamma-radiation at doses of 1 , 5 , and 10 Gray on DNA and subsequent repair by C3H10T1/2 cells ( mouse embryo fibroblasts ) were investigated . Two versions of the comet assay , a sensitive method for evaluating DNA damage , were implemented : the alkaline one to detect single-strand breaks , and the neutral one to identify double-strand breaks . The results show a good linear relation between DNA damage and radiation dose , for both single-strand and double-strand breaks . A statistically significant difference with respect to controls was found at the lowest dose of 1 Gy . Heterogeneity in DNA damage within the cell population was observed as a function of radiation dose . Repair kinetics showed that most of the damage was repaired within 2 h after irradiation , and that the highest rejoining rate occurred with the highest dose ( 10 Gy ) . Single-strand breaks were completely repaired 24 h after irradiation , whereas residual double-strand breaks were still present . This finding needs further investigation .
The RuvABC and RecBCD proteins promote rescue of stalled or broken DNA replication forks in Escherichia coli . Strains lacking these proteins cope poorly with DNA damage and have problems with chromosome segregation and cell division . We show how these difficulties are overcome to varying degrees by a sub-class of RNA polymerase mutations selected for their stringent phenotype . Thirty-five mutations were sequenced . All but one change single amino acids in RpoB or RpoC that lie on or near the path taken by DNA through the enzyme , indicating they may affect the stability of transcription complexes . Four mutant enzymes are shown to form unstable open complexes at the lambdacro promoter . At least one may also release stalled complexes or limit their formation , as it reduces the need for reactivation of transcription by GreA or GreB , and for transcription-coupled DNA repair of UV damage by Mfd . The results shed light on the interplay between DNA replication and transcription and suggest ways in which conflicts between these two vital cellular processes are avoided or resolved .
Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum ( II ) ( cisplatin ) is a well characterized antitumor drug used for the treatment of a variety of human cancers . The cytotoxicity of cisplatin is mainly mediated through the formation of DNA adducts , which are also believed to be responsible for the secondary malignancies produced by the drug . The aim of this study was to determine the in vivo mutagenic activity of cisplatin in the lacZ plasmid-based transgenic mouse model . The mutant frequency ( MF ) and the spectrum of mutations induced by cisplatin in the mouse liver were analyzed and compared to controls . The mean MF in the lacZ gene was increased 2-fold in mice treated with a single 6 mg/kg body weight dose of cisplatin and sacrificed after 17 and 28 days ( P = 0.001 and P < 0.0001 ) . Restriction analysis and sequencing of mutant DNA showed that cisplatin was able to induce both large deletions and point mutations . A specific profile of base substitution and frameshift mutations was identified in treated mice , consisting primarily of G:C-->A:T transitions at GpG and ApG sites , the preferential DNA binding sites of cisplatin , and single basepair deletions/insertions . The present results provide the first evidence that cisplatin has mutagenic activity in vivo and induces a characteristic pattern of mutations in the mouse liver . This mutagenicity may be responsible for its tumorigenic activity .
Epidemiological data and animal models have provided evidence that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) have an anticancer effect . However , the molecular mechanisms underlying these antineoplastic effects are not well understood . We described previously that expression levels of the chemokine receptor , CCR5 , and the beta2-integrin , Mac-1 , were down-regulated on primary monocytes after incubation in supernatants from human carcinoma cell lines , and that this down-regulation resulted in impaired monocyte function with respect to migration and adhesion . We now demonstrate that these impairments are also present in vivo . Monocytes from cancer patients displayed significantly reduced CCR5 levels and migration capacities in comparison to cells from healthy donors . Because migration is necessary for the antitumor activity of monocytes/macrophages , these deficits may contribute to the suppressed immune system seen in cancer patients . In a clinical study , we analyzed the effect of a selective COX-2 inhibitor , Rofecoxib , on the migration of monocytes derived from cancer patients . The results revealed significant improvement in migration equal to those levels seen in healthy donors . We conclude that in patients with cancer , the intake of Rofecoxib for 3 wk leads to significant restoration of monocyte function . These data may , at least in part , help explain the anticancer effects of NSAIDs .
A6 is an eight amino acid peptide derived from the non-receptor binding region of urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) , which interferes with the uPA/uPA receptor system . A6 has been synthesized as a potential anti-angiogenic , anti-cancer agent . The current study has investigated the potential therapeutic activity of A6 in the Lewis lung carcinoma ( 3LL ) model of pulmonary metastasis . A6 was found to have direct anti-tumor activity against established 3LL pulmonary metastases at a low tumor burden ( 10-20 colonies per lung ) and was therapeutic in combination with cyclophosphamide at high tumor burdens ( > 100 colonies per lung ) . Mechanistic studies have revealed that A6 directly inhibits the invasion of 3LL cells through a Matrigel model basement membrane by 40-45% . Moreover , treatment with either A6 or doxorubicin resulted in thicker tubes in endothelial tube formation studies . Our results suggest that A6 , by virtue of its anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic properties , might work additively or synergistically with chemotherapeutic agents and thereby contribute to enhanced therapy of established 3LL cancer metastases .
Tumor-associated macrophages ( TAM ) have been shown to play an important role in tumor angiogenesis . The purpose of this study was to determine whether monocyte recruitment , activation and differentiation mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) and macrophage colony stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) modulate the expression of the angiogenic factor , Interleukin ( IL)-8 . Isolated human peripheral blood monocytes secreted low basal levels of IL-8 . Incubation of monocytes with M-CSF or MCP-1 resulted in an up-regulation of IL-8 mRNA and protein expression . The differential expression of IL-8 by monocytes following MCP-1 and M-CSF treatments involved activation of the NFkB transcription factor . Further activation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) caused an increase in IL-8 secretion in monocytes but not in monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ) . MDM-conditioned media significantly up-regulated IL-8 expression in human malignant melanoma cells in vitro . In summary , we demonstrated that MCP-1 and M-CSF , critical for monocyte recruitment , activation and differentiation , differentially regulate IL-8 expression and may play an important role in monocyte/macrophage-mediated tumor angiogenesis .
Recent studies have shown that the antiestrogen tamoxifen ( TAM ) can be used in the treatment of malignant neoplasms other than breast cancer . In the present study , we investigated the expression of estrogen receptor ( ER ) in six malignant rhabdoid tumor ( MRT ) cell lines . Alterations in MRT cell growth in response to estrogen or antiestrogens ( 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( 4-OHT ) , TAM , and ICI 182 780 ) were also investigated . RT-PCR and western blotting showed that ER-alpha was expressed in three of the six MRT cell lines . While 17-beta-estradiol ( E2 ) did not significantly alter MRT cell line proliferation , the hydroxylated tamoxifen metabolite 4-OHT significantly inhibited the growth of all 6 MRT cell lines . However , the steroidal antiestrogen ICI 182 780 did not alter the proliferation of any of the MRT cell lines. 4-OHT induced apoptosis in both ER-alpha-negative and ER-alpha-positive MRT cell lines , as assessed by nuclear morphology and DNA fragmentation . Neither growth inhibition nor induction of apoptosis due to 4-OHT was blocked by the addition of excess E2 . Our data suggested that 4-OHT induced cytotoxic effects against MRT cells , and that these effects were independent of ER expression .
cDNA microarray-based gene expression analysis has been successfully employed to explore the action mechanism and to validate the targets of several drugs . In the present study , we evaluated anti-angiogenic activity of demethoxycurcumin ( DC ) , a structural analog of curcumin , isolated from Curcuma aromatica , and investigated the effect of DC on genetic reprogramming in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) using cDNA microarray analysis . Of 1024 human cancer-focused genes arrayed , 187 genes were up-regulated and 72 genes were down-regulated at least 2-fold by DC . Interestingly , 9 angiogenesis-related genes were down-regulated over 5-fold in response to DC , suggesting that the genetic reprogramming was crucially involved in anti-angiogenesis by the compound . To verify the results obtained from cDNA microarray analysis , matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , the product of one of the angiogenesis-related genes down-regulated over 5-fold by DC , was investigated using gelatin zymography . DC potently inhibited the expression of MMP-9 , yet showed no direct effect on its activity . These data show that gene expressional change of MMP-9 is a major mediator for angiogenesis inhibition by DC . All genes identified and microarray data are available on the web at http://dasan.sejong.ac.kr/
The colon carcinoma cell line CC531 is metastatic to liver after splenic injection in syngeneic rats . After repeated in vivo passages , a subline was selected that produced liver metastases at a considerably higher rate than the original cell line . These cells were characterized by increased intracellular glutathione , proliferation and ability to restore glutathione after exposure to oxidative stress , thus indicating an elevated resistance to oxidative stress . Furthermore , the increased metastatic ability was also accompanied by increased proliferation rate , adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and endothelial cells , and secretion of a 60 kD matrix metalloproteinase . When cultured in vitro for a prolonged time ( more than 30 trypsinizations ) , the cells showed a reduced in vivo metastatic ability , reduced secretion of three metalloproteinases including the 60 kD proteinase , and reduced intracellular glutathione . These results indicate that metastatic ability can be influenced through several adaptive mechanisms , and that the cell's ability to resist oxidative stress and maintain intracellular glutathione are of central importance .
The Sonic hedgehog ( SHH ) pathway is implicated in the etiology of the most common human cancer in Caucasians , the basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) . Mutations in the receptor of SHH , the patched gene , have been characterized in sporadic BCCs as well as those from patients with the rare genetic syndromes nevoid BCC and xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) . To elucidate the role of UV in the deregulation of the SHH pathway , we analyzed for alterations of smoothened , a transmembrane signaling component regulated by patched , in BCCs and squamous cell carcinomas from UV hypersensitive XP patients . We find UV-specific smoothened mutations in 30% of XP BCCs , three times higher than those in sporadic Caucasian BCCs , confirming the high rate of UV-induced mutations in DNA repair-deficient XP patients . No alteration was found in XP squamous cell carcinomas , indicating the involvement of smoothened specifically in the development of BCC .
OBJECTIVE To design and develop a novel , sensitive and versatile method for in vivo foot printing and studies of DNA damage , such as DNA adducts and strand breaks . METHODS Starting with mammalian genomic DNA , single-stranded products were made by repeated primer extension , these products were ligated to a double-stranded linker having a randomized 3 ' overhang , and used for PCR . DNA breaks in p53 gene produced by restriction endonuclease AfaI were detected by using this new method followed by Southern hybridization with DIG-labeled probe . RESULTS This randomized terminal linker-dependent PCR ( RDPCR ) method could generate band signals many-fold stronger than conventional ligation-mediated PCR ( LMPCR ) , and it was more rapid , convenient and accurate than the terminal transferase-dependent PCR ( TDPCR ) . CONCLUSION DNA strand breakage can be detected sensitively in the gene level by RDPCR . Any lesion that blocks primer extension should be detectable .
DNA-protein cross-links ( DPCs ) are formed upon exposure to a variety of chemical and physical agents and pose a threat to genomic integrity . In particular , acrolein and related aldehydes produce DPCs , although the chemical linkages for such cross-links have not been identified . Here , we report that oligodeoxynucleotides containing 1,N(2)-deoxyguanosine adducts of acrolein , crotonaldehyde , and trans-4-hydroxynonenal can form cross-links with the tetrapeptide Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys . We concluded that complex formation is mediated by a Schiff base linkage because DNA-peptide complexes were covalently trapped following reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride , and pre-reduction of adducted DNAs inhibited complex formation . A previous NMR study demonstrated that duplex DNA catalyzes ring opening for the acrolein-derived gamma-hydroxy-1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosine adduct to yield an aldehydic function ( de los Santos , C. , Zaliznyak , T. , and Johnson , F . ( 2001 ) J. Biol . Chem. 276 , 9077-9082 ) . Consistent with this earlier observation , the adducts under investigation were more reactive in duplex DNA than in single-stranded DNA , and we concluded that the ring-open aldehydic moiety is the induced tautomer in duplex DNA for adducts exhibiting high relative reactivity . Adducted DNA cross-linked to Arg-Trp-Arg-Arg and Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys with comparable efficiency , and N(alpha)-acetylation of peptides dramatically inhibited trapping ; thus , the reactive nucleophile is located at the N-terminal alpha-amine of the peptide . These data suggest that Schiff base chemistry can mediate DPC formation in vivo following the formation of stable aldehyde-derived DNA adducts .
Recent studies indicate that cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) is overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and may play a critical role in this rapidly progressing form of cancer . A human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line , Mia PaCa-2 , was incubated for 18 hours with 5 micromol/L of rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) , a selective COX-2 inhibitor . Total RNA was isolated and gene expression analyzed by DNA microarray chips . In a separate experiment , athymic mice were orthotopically injected with 7.5 x 10(5) Mia PaCa-2 cells through a minilaparotomy . After 1 month , laparotomy was repeated to measure tumor size , and mice were randomized to receive reformulated rodent chow containing either 12.5 mg/kg/day of rofecoxib or no drug for 21 days . Tumor growth was assessed by comparing volume before and after treatment . In vitro , rofecoxib decreased gene expression of cyclin D1/PRAD1 , a key component of cell cycle progression , while increasing expression of several cell cycle arrest genes , including p21/WAF1 , p33/ING , GADD34 , and GADD45 ( P < 0.05 ) . In vivo , tumor growth was significantly reduced in treated vs. control mice ( P < 0.05 ) . No systemic toxicity was observed in mice receiving rofecoxib . These data suggest that rofecoxib slows the growth of human pancreatic cancer through changes in gene expression that favor cell cycle arrest .
BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE There is little ideal predictor available on evaluating the lymph node metastatic potential of breast carcinoma . This study was designed to determine the expression of gene products of E-cadherin ( epithelial ) , N-cadherin ( nerve ) , and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) in breast carcinoma tissue and investigate their association with the invasion and metastasis of breast carcinoma . METHODS The authors examined the expressions of E-cadherin , N-cadherin , and MMP-9 in 72 cases of breast carcinoma(39 cases with lymph node metastasis and 33 cases without lymph node metastasis ) by immunohistochemistry . Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the patients ' prognosis . RESULTS The average ranks of E-cadherin in lymph node metastasis group and no lymph node metastasis group were 29.19 and 45.14 , respectively , with significant difference ( P < 0.001 ) . The expression of E-cadherin was correlated inversely with the metastasis of breast carcinoma . The average ranks of N-cadherin and MMP-9 were 40.04 and 42.97 in lymph node metastasis group , and 32.32 and 28.85 in no lymph node metastasis group , both with significant difference ( P < 0.05 ) , and these expressions were positively correlated with the lymph node metastasis of breast carcinoma . The patients who had high expression of E-cadherin had a longer survival time . CONCLUSION Expression of E-cadherin , N-cadherin , and MMP-9 are associated strongly with lymph node metastasis of breast carcinoma . These proteins are indicators of metastasis potential and prognosis of breast carcinoma .
BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE Usually pituitary adenomas are histological benign and grow slowly , but a proportion of them will become locally aggressive , and develop into invasive pituitary adenomas . The reasons for these differences in tumor behavior are poorly understood . Pituitary adenomas are abounding blood vessels . Angiogenesis and tumor invasion both require degradation of the extracellular matrix components to allow cell migration . The matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) may play a central role in these processes . The aggressive mechanism of pituitary adenomas was studied through investigating the expression of MMP-9 , MMP-2 , TIMP-1 , and TIMP-2 in both invasive and non-invasive adenomas . METHODS Sixty-one surgical removed pituitary adenomas ( forty-nine cases invasive and twelve non-invasive adenomas ) were investigated . Immunohistochemistry staining ( SP method ) was used to detect the expression of MMP-9 , MMP-2 , TIMP-1 , and TIMP-2 in two groups . The results were treated with semi-quantitative method and analyzed by using non-parameter rank sum test . RESULTS Immunohistochemical staining of tumor cells for MMP-9 , TIMP-1 , MMP-2 , and TIMP-2 were noted 95.9% ( 47/49 ) , 57.1% ( 28/49 ) , 75.5% ( 37/49 ) and 89.8% ( 44/49 ) in invasive adenomas , and 100% ( 12/12 ) , 91.7% ( 11/12 ) , 66.7% ( 8/12 ) , and 91.7% ( 11/12 ) in non-invasive adenomas , respectively . Invasive tumors were significantly less expressing TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 ( P < 0.05 ) . There was no significant difference for MMP-9 or MMP-2 between invasive and non-invasive groups ( P > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 may play a key role in invasive pituitary adenomas to biological behavior .
The xeroderma pigmentosum group C ( XPC ) protein specifically involved in genome-wide damage recognition for nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) was purified as a tight complex with HR23B , one of the two mammalian homologs of RAD23 in budding yeast . This XPC-HR23B complex exhibits strong binding affinity for single-stranded DNA , as well as preferential binding to various types of damaged DNA . To examine the structure-function relationship of XPC , a series of truncated mutant proteins were generated and assayed for various binding activities . The two domains participating in binding to HR23B and damaged DNA , respectively , were mapped within the carboxy-terminal half of XPC , which also contains an evolutionary conserved amino acid sequence homologous to the yeast RAD4 protein . We established that the carboxy-terminal 125 amino acids are dispensable for both HR23B and damaged DNA binding , while interactions with transcription factor IIH ( TFIIH ) are significantly impaired by truncation of this domain . Furthermore , deletion of the extreme carboxy-terminal domain totally abolished XPC activity in the cell-free NER reaction . These results suggest that following initial damage recognition , the carboxy terminus of XPC may be essential for the recruitment of TFIIH , and that most truncation mutations identified in XP-C patients result in non-functional proteins .
Cancer-prone diseases ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT ) , Nijmegen breakage syndrome ( NBS ) and ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder ( ATLD ) are defective in the repair of DNA double-stranded break ( DSB ) . On the other hand , arsenic ( As ) has been reported to cause DSB and to be involved in the occurrence of skin , lung and bladder cancers . To dissect the repair mechanism of As-induced DSB , wild type , AT and NBS cells were treated with sodium arsenite to study the complex formation and post-translational modification of Rad50/NBS1/Mre11 repair proteins . Our results showed that Mre11 went through cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation upon sodium arsenite treatment and this post-translational modification required NBS1 but not ATM . Defective As-induced Mre11 phosphorylation was rescued by reconstitution with full length NBS1 in NBS cells . Although As-induced Mre11 phosphorylation was not required for Rad50/NBS1/Mre11 complex formation , it might be required for the formation of Rad50/NBS1/Mre11 nuclear foci upon DNA damage .
This study was set up to investigate the relationships between the formation and removal of DNA damage in form of 8-oxodeoxyguanosine ( 8-oxodG ) in neonatal ( day 16 of gestation ) as compared to adult rats . The hypothesis addressed was whether the rapidly dividing foetal tissue has an enhanced requirement of DNA repair providing protection against potentially mutagenic DNA damages such as 8-oxodG . The activity of the primary 8-oxodG-repair protein OGG1 was measured by a DNA incision assay and the expression of OGG1 mRNA was measured by Real-Time PCR normalised to 18S rRNA . The tissue level of 8-oxodG was measured by HPLC-ECD . We found a 2-3-fold increased incision activity in the foetal control tissue , together with a 3-15-fold increase in mRNA of OGG1 as compared to liver tissue from adult rats . The levels of 8-oxodG in the foetal tissue were unaltered as compared to the adult groups . To increase the levels of 8-oxodG , the rats received an injection ( i.p. ) of the hepatotoxin 2-nitropropane . The compound induced significant levels of 8-oxodG in male rat livers 5h after the injection and in the foetuses 24h after the injection , while the female rats showed no increase in 8-oxodG . The incision activity was slightly depressed in both male and female liver tissue and in the foetal tissue 5h after the injection , but significantly increased from 5 to 24h after the injection . However , it did not reach levels significantly above the control levels . In conclusion , this study confirms that foetal tissue has increased levels of OGG1 mRNA and correspondingly an enhanced incision activity on an 8-oxodG substrate in a crude tissue extract .
In both mitotic and meiotic processes , cellular surveillance of the integrity of genetic information transmission from parental cells to their subsequent generations is carried out by a network of proteins primarily involved in cell-cycle regulation , DNA replication , DNA repair , and chromosome segregation . Within this context , the mammalian MRE11 represents an essential multifunctional protein that promotes repair of DNA double-strand breaks and plays a role in the signaling of DNA damage response . Mutations in human hMRE11 gene could contribute to the rare " AT-like " disorder . However , at present time the functional roles of hMRE11 in these cellular processes are elusive . In the current study , we provide evidence that hMRE11 interacts physically with the mismatch repair protein hMLH1 through yeast two-hybrid analysis . In addition , we show that recombinant hMRE11 and hMLH1 proteins interact when these two proteins are coexpressed in bacterial cells , and both proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from human cell extracts . Furthermore , hMRE11 and hMLH1 display similar expression patterns when examined with a human normal/tumor DNA array . Together , these data suggest that hMRE11 and hMLH1 might act in a co-operative fashion during DNA damage detection , signaling , and repair .
Many different cellular pathways have evolved to protect the genome from the deleterious effects of DNA damage that result from exposure to chemical and physical agents . Among these is a process called transcription-coupled repair ( TCR ) that catalyzes the removal of DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of expressed genes , often resulting in a preferential bias of damage clearance from this strand relative to its non-transcribed counterpart . Lesions subject to this type of repair include cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers that are normally repaired by nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and thymine glycols ( TGs ) that are removed primarily by base excision repair ( BER ) . While the mechanism underlying TCR is not completely clear , it is known that its facilitation requires proteins used by other repair pathways like NER . It is also believed that the signal for TCR is the stalled RNA polymerase that results when DNA damage prevents its translocation during transcription elongation . While there is a clear role for some NER proteins in TCR , the involvement of BER proteins is less clear . To explore this further , we studied the removal of 7-methylguanine ( 7MeG ) and 3-methyladenine ( 3MeA ) from the dihydrofolate reductase ( dhfr ) gene of murine cell lines that vary in their repair phenotypes. 7MeG and 3MeA constitute the two principal N-methylpurines formed in DNA following exposure to methylating agents . In mammalian cells , alkyladenine DNA alkyladenine glycosylase ( Aag ) is the major enzyme required for the repair of these lesions via BER , and their removal from the total genome is quite rapid . There is no observable TCR of these lesions in specific genes in DNA repair proficient cells ; however , it is possible that the rapid repair of these adducts by BER masks any TCR . The repair of 3MeA and 7MeG was examined in cells lacking Aag , NER , or both Aag and NER to determine if rapid overall repair masks TCR . The results show that both 3MeA and 7MeG are removed without strand bias from the dhfr gene of BER deficient ( Aag deficient ) and NER deficient murine cell lines . Furthermore , repair of 3MeA in this region is highly dependent on Aag , but repair of 7MeG is equally efficient in the repair proficient , BER deficient , and NER deficient cell lines . Strikingly , in the absence of both BER and NER , neither 7MeG nor 3MeA is repaired . These results demonstrate that NER , but not TCR , contributes to the repair of 7MeG , and to a lesser extent 3MeA .
Free radical-induced cellular stress contributes to cancer during chronic inflammation . Here , we investigated mechanisms of p53 activation by the free radical , NO . NO from donor drugs induced both ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM)- and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related-dependent p53 posttranslational modifications , leading to an increase in p53 transcriptional targets and a G(2)M cell cycle checkpoint . Such modifications were also identified in cells cocultured with NO-releasing macrophages . In noncancerous colon tissues from patients with ulcerative colitis ( a cancer-prone chronic inflammatory disease ) , inducible NO synthase protein levels were positively correlated with p53 serine 15 phosphorylation levels . Immunostaining of HDM-2 and p21(WAF1) was consistent with transcriptionally active p53 . Our study highlights a pivotal role of NO in the induction of cellular stress and the activation of a p53 response pathway during chronic inflammation .
Adenoid cystic carcinoma ( ACC ) of the salivary glands is a highly infiltrative malignant tumour with a tendency for lung metastasis . Gene therapy could be a potentially effective therapy for ACC and its metastasis . The aims of the study were : To transduce interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene into an ACC cell line with predisposition for lung metastasis ( ACC-M ) ; to compare the bioactivity of the gene-transduced cells and the parent cell line in vitro and in vivo . The IL-2 gene was transduced via a bicistronic retroviral vector into the ACC-M cells . The growth rate and DNA cell cycles of the parent ACC-M , the control viral vector AmGCEN , and the gene transduced AmIL-2 cell cultures were compared quantitatively and by flow cytometry , respectively . The tumourigenic ability of the three cell lines was verified by inoculation in athymic nude mice . The tumours developed were extracted and compared quantitatively and histologically . There was no difference in the growth rate and the DNA count between the ACC-M , AmGCEN , and AmIL-2 cell cultures . In the animal experiment , both the ACC-M and AmGCEN cells stimulated lung metastasis in all the mice , whereas there was no tumour found in the 1 x 10(6) AmIL-2 cells inoculation . On 3 x 10(6) AmIL-2 cells stimulation , three out of six mice developed tumours but the mass and volume of the tumours were smaller than the other two groups . Under light microscopy , the ACC-M tumours were mainly poorly differentiated with minimal cellular matrix , whereas the AmIL-2 tumours were well differentiated with ample matrix . The transduction of IL-2 gene can reduce the tumourigenicity of ACC-M cells and induces tumour cell differentiation in mice . The IL-2 gene can be a potential effective gene for the treatment of adenoid cystic carcinoma of salivary glands and its lung metastasis .
DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) is the process by which incorrectly paired DNA nucleotides are recognized and repaired . A germline mutation in one of the genes involved in the process may be responsible for a dominantly inherited cancer syndrome , hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer . Cancer progression in predisposed individuals results from the somatic inactivation of the normal copy of the MMR gene , leading to a mutator phenotype affecting preferentially repeat sequences ( microsatellite instability , MSI ) . Recently , we identified children with a constitutional deficiency of MMR activity attributable to a mutation in the h MLH1 gene . These children exhibited a constitutional genetic instability associated with clinical features of de novo neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) and early onset of extracolonic cancer . Based on these observations , we hypothesized that somatic NF1 gene mutation was a frequent and possibly early event in MMR-deficient cells . To test this hypothesis , we screened for NF1 mutations in cancer cells . Genetic alterations were identified in five out of ten tumor cell lines with MSI , whereas five MMR-proficient tumor cell lines expressed a wild-type NF1 gene . Somatic NF1 mutations were also detected in two primary tumors exhibiting an MSI phenotype . Finally , a 35-bp deletion in the murine Nf1 coding region was identified in mlh1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts . These observations demonstrate that the NF1 gene is a mutational target of MMR deficiency and suggest that its inactivation is an important step of the malignant progression of MMR-deficient cells .
Like all cancers , breast cancer is considered to result in part from the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations leading to oncogene overexpression and tumor suppressor loss . More recently , CpG island hypermethylation is known to be associated with gene silencing in cancer , and these silenced genes can be reactivated by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5-Aza-CdR ) . Retionoic acid receptor beta 2 gene is a tumor suppressor gene and the chemopreventive effects of retinoids are due to induction of RAR beta 2 . In this study , the effect of 5-Aza-CdR RAR beta 2 restoration was investigated in the MRK-nu-1 human female breast cancer cell line . Changes of the RAR beta 2 methylation status were assessed by methylation-specific PCR . Reverse transcription PCR was used to evaluate RARb beta 2 restoration . Cell cycling and growth inhibition were studied using flow cytometric analysis of DNA content and CellTiter 96 AQueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay , respectively. 5-Aza-CdR treatment resulted in complete demethylation of the RAR beta 2 gene . RAR beta 2 restoration was accompanied by cell cycle arrest ( increase in the G0/G1- and decrease in the S- and G2/M-phases ) and time-dependent growth inhibition . In conclusion , RAR beta 2 can be activated in vitro by 5-Aza-CdR , which may be one of the mechanisms for the tumor cell growth inhibition by 5-Aza-CdR .
We have recently identified ICBP90 as being a protein able to bind in vitro a CCAAT box of the topoisomerase II alpha gene promoter . The aim of the present work was to check whether ICBP90 is able to regulate in vivo topoisomerase II alpha expression in human lung fibroblasts under various proliferating conditions . Transient transfection experiments performed on moderately growing human lung fibroblasts ( 50% of confluence ) showed that overexpression of ICBP90 is associated with an elevation of topoisomerase II alpha expression and an increase of the cell proliferation rate . In highly proliferating human lung fibroblasts ( 20% confluence ) overexpression of ICBP90 had no effect . In contrast , in non-proliferating fibroblasts ( 100% confluence ) overexpression of ICBP90 allowed recovery of topoisomerase II alpha expression levels with a concomitant overgrowth of confluent cell cultures . Our results show that ICBP90 regulates topoisomerase II alpha expression and is able to overcome cell contact inhibition signaling , suggesting that increased ICBP90 expression may be involved in carcinogenesis .
Glycol ethers are known reproductive and developmental toxins in laboratory animals , but little is known about their genotoxic effects in humans . In the current article , the authors tested the hypothesis that human in utero exposure to ethylene glycol monomethyl ether ( EGME ) is associated with the development of specific congenital anomalies and elevated levels of chromosome aberrations . The authors conducted a clinical and cytogenetic evaluation of 41 offspring of 28 females occupationally exposed to EGME for an average duration of 4.6 yr . Six offspring of 5 women who were occupationally exposed to EGME during pregnancy exhibited characteristic dysmorphic features that were not observed in 35 offspring of 23 women who worked in the same facility , but who were not pregnant at the time of exposure . Persistent cytogenetic damage was observed exclusively in all 6 in-utero-exposed offspring , but not in their 12 match non-in-utero-exposed controls . The study characterizes EGME as a human teratogen , as indicated by the prevalence of characteristic dysmorphic features and persistent cytogenetic damage in individuals exposed in utero to this chemical .
Mice defective in the mismatch repair ( MMR ) gene Msh2 manifest an enhanced predisposition to skin cancer associated with exposure to UVB radiation . This predisposition is further heightened if the mice are additionally defective for the nucleotide excision repair gene Xpc . To test the hypothesis that the predisposition of Msh2 mutant mice to skin cancer reflects a mutator phenotype associated with increased proliferation of skin cells following exposure to UV radiation , Msh2 mutant mice were exposed to the tumor promoter TPA . Such mice showed a robust proliferative response in the skin , but did not manifest evidence of dysplasia or neoplasia . We conclude that the predisposition of Msh2 mice to UVB radiation-induced skin cancer reflects an interaction between the processes of mismatch repair and some other excision repair mode , the exact nature of which remains to be established .
Vanadium pentoxide , commercially the most important compound of vanadium , presents a potential occupational hazard during the cleaning of oil-fired boilers and furnaces , the handling of catalysts , and during the refining , processing , or burning of vanadium-rich mineral ores or fossil fuels . Vanadium pentoxide was nominated for study by the National Cancer Institute as a representative of the metals class study . Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to vanadium pentoxide ( 99% pure ) by inhalation for 16 days , 14 weeks , or 2 years . Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and mouse peripheral blood. 16-DAY STUDY IN RATS : Groups of five male and five female rats were exposed to particulate aerosols of vanadium pentoxide at concentrations of 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , or 32 mg/m(3) by inhalation , 6 hours per day , 5 days per week for 16 days . Three males in the 32 mg/m(3) group died before the end of the study . Mean body weights of males and females exposed to 8 mg/m(3) or greater were less than those of the chamber controls . Clinical findings included rapid respiration and hypoactivity in rats exposed to 16 or 32 mg/m(3) . Relative lung weights of 4 mg/m(3) or greater males and 2 mg/m(3) or greater females were significantly greater than those of the chamber controls . Lavage fluid analysis indicated an inflammatory response in the lung that was either directly mediated by vanadium pentoxide or was secondary to lung damage induced by vanadium pentoxide exposure. 16-DAY STUDY IN MICE : Groups of five male and five female mice were exposed to particulate aerosols of vanadium pentoxide at concentrations of 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , or 32 mg/m(3) by inhalation , 6 hours per day , 5 days per week for 16 days . All males exposed to 32 mg/m(3) and one 8 mg/m(3) male died or were killed moribund before the end of the study . Mean body weights of 16 mg/m(3) males and 8 mg/m(3) or greater females were significantly less than those of the chamber controls , and the 32 mg/m(3) females lost weight during the study . Absolute and relative lung weights of 4 mg/m(3) or greater males and all exposed groups of females and liver weights of 16 mg/m(3) males were significantly greater than those of the chamber controls . The mediastinal lymph nodes were enlarged in 4 , 8 , and 16 mg/m(3) males and females , and lymphoid hyperplasia was confirmed histologically . Lavage fluid analysis indicated an inflammatory response in the lung that was either directly mediated by vanadium pentoxide or was secondary to lung damage induced by vanadium pentoxide exposure. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS : Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to particulate aerosols of vanadium pentoxide at concentrations of 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , or 16 mg/m(3) by inhalation , 6 hours per day , 5 days per week for 3 months . Seven males and three females exposed to 16 mg/m(3) died during the study . Mean body weights were significantly less in males exposed to 4 mg/m(3) or greater and in females exposed to 16 mg/m(3) . Abnormal breathing , thinness , lethargy , abnormal posture , and ruffled fur were observed in rats exposed to 16 mg/m(3) . Hematology results indicated that exposure of rats to vanadium pentoxide induced a microcytic erythrocytosis in males and females . Absolute and relative lung weights were significantly greater for 4 mg/m(3) or greater males and females than for the chamber controls as were the relative lung weights of 2 mg/m(3) males . The estrous cycle of females exposed to 8 mg/m(3) was significantly longer than that of the chamber control group , and the number of cycling females in the 16 mg/m(3) group was reduced . The incidences of several nonneoplastic lesions of the lung and nose were significantly increased in males and females exposed to 2 mg/m(3) or greater . Data from pulmonary function analyses indicated that a restrictive lung disease was present in male and female rats exposed to 4 mg/m(3) or greater , while an obstructive lung disease was present only in the 16 mg/m(3) groups. 3-MONTH STUDY IN MICE : Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were exposed to par
An efficent antitumor and antiviral cellular immune response requires optimal interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) secretion and perforin expression in CD8(+) T cells . The aim of this study was to define whether CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from patients with undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type ( UCNT ) , a tumor regularly associated with the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , have abnormal phenotype profiles , cytokine production , perforin and CD3-zeta expressions . Our data showed that CD4 and CD8 subset distribution was not grossly altered in the peripheral blood of UCNT patients , while tumor biopsies contained an increased proportion of CD8(+) T cells . The analysis of the CD4(+) subset showed a defect in interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) production and a moderate increase of IL-10 production , a situation consistent with a Th1/Th2 imbalance . We have also demonstrated that CD8(+) lymphocytes from UCNT patients had a marked impairment of IFN-gamma secretion and perforin expression . This impairment was not related to the presence of detectable EBV DNA in the plasma . In UCNT patients , the blockade of the perforin pathway and of IFN-gamma production may constitute important mechanisms for immune escape by the tumor and for impaired control of EBV replication .
Natural killer ( NK ) and CD56(+) T cells are thought to play a central role in antitumour immunity . Their cytolytic activities are controlled by a variety of receptors including CD94 and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors ( KIR ) , which bind to major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I molecules on target cells and mediate cell activation or inhibition . We have examined the numbers , phenotypes and antitumour cytotoxic functions of hepatic NK and CD56(+) T cells isolated from 22 patients with hepatic malignancy and 19 healthy donors . Flow cytometry revealed that NK cell numbers were increased among hepatic mononuclear cells in malignancy compared to histologically normal livers ( mean : 38% vs 27% ; P=0.03 ) , but CD56(+) T cell numbers were not ( 28% vs 27% ) . NK cells and CD56(+) T cells from tumour-bearing livers exhibited lymphokine-activated killing of K562 targets and T cell receptor-mediated lysis of P815 cells . The expression of CD94 and the KIR isotypes CD158a , CD158b and KIR3DL1 by CD56(+) T cells and NK cells was significantly and consistently reduced in tumour-bearing livers compared to healthy livers ( P<0.05 in all cases ) . Simultaneous ligation of CD158a , CD158b and KIR3DL1 caused an overall partial inhibition of CD56(+) T cell cytotoxic activity , suggesting that the observed reductions in KIR(+) cell numbers in malignancy are likely to lead to enhanced cytotoxicity . Our results suggest that , while hepatic CD56(+) T cells are not expanded in malignancy , downregulation of KIR and CD94 expression may be a mechanism by which the hepatic immune system can be activated to facilitate tumour rejection .
PURPOSE Although the adrenal gland is a common site of extrahepatic metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , there are no definitive guidelines for the treatment of adrenal metastasis . This study examines the effectiveness of various treatments for this disease . METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 20 patients treated for adrenal metastasis of HCC by adrenalectomy ( n = 13 ) , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , or percutaneous ethanol injection therapy ( PEIT ) ( n = 7 ) . RESULTS There were no significant differences in cumulative survival rates between patients given adrenalectomy and those given TACE or PEIT , either after completing treatment for primary HCC or after the first treatment for adrenal metastasis . Six of seven patients with tumor thrombi in the inferior vena cava ( IVC ) from adrenal metastasis underwent adrenalectomy combined with intracaval thrombectomy , five of whom survived for more than 1 year after surgery , and two of whom are still alive without any recurrence more than 3 years after surgery . PEIT showed good results for small adrenal metastasis . CONCLUSION These findings suggest that therapeutic modalities should be chosen according to the clinical features of each individual , including the size of the metastatic tumor , whether there is invasion into the IVC , the function of the remaining liver , and the existence of intra- and/or nonadrenal extrahepatic lesions . Furthermore , intracaval tumor thrombectomy could be indicated for patients with IVC thrombus if they are suitable candidates for surgery .
Polo-like kinase 3 ( Plk3 , alternatively termed Prk ) is involved in the regulation of DNA damage checkpoint as well as in M-phase function . Plk3 physically interacts with p53 and phosphorylates this tumor suppressor protein on serine-20 , suggesting that the role of Plk3 in cell cycle progression is mediated , at least in part , through direct regulation of p53 . Here we show that Plk3 is rapidly activated by reactive oxygen species in normal diploid fibroblast cells ( WI-38 ) , correlating with a subsequent increase in p53 protein level . Plk3 physically interacts with Chk2 and the interaction is enhanced upon DNA damage . In addition , Chk2 immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of Daudi ( which expressed little Plk3 ) is capable of stimulating the kinase activity of purified recombinant Plk3 in vitro , and this stimulation is more pronounced when Plk3 is supplemented with Chk2 immunoprecipitated from Daudi after DNA damage . Furthermore , ectopic expression Chk2 activates cellular Plk3 . Together , our studies suggest Chk2 may mediate direct activation of Plk3 in response to genotoxic stresses .
An in vitro angiogenesis system was designed for screening angiogenic agonists and antagonists . In order to obtain large quantities of cells and reproducibility , human endothelial cells with extended life spans were developed by retroviral transfection . The resulting cells grown in a serum-free medium containing endothelial cell growth supplement ( ECGS ) have a telomerase activity , extended life spans of at least 21 passages , and an endothelial cell phenotype ( diI-acetylated-LDL upake , factor VIII-related antigen , VEGFR-1 and R-2 , and tissue-type plasminogen activator ( tPA) ) that resembled that of unaltered primary endothelial cells . Exceptions were ( i ) a higher expression of tPA , and ( ii ) a non-significant growth response to FGF-2 or VEGF stimulation . Within three-dimensional fibrin gels , specific cell clones rapidly formed tubular structures in a more reproducible manner than those observed with low-passage primary cells . Tube formation by primary endothelial cells and those with extended life spans was dependent upon FGF-2 and ECGS , respectively . Both cell types produced FGF-2 and VEGF cytokines . Increasing doses of suramin significantly decreased the size of microvessels formed by both cell lines . These functional results indicate that a vascular matrix system containing human cells with extended life spans can be successfully utilized as an in vitro assay for antiangiogenic compounds .
We examined the inducibility of drug resistance ( MDR1 , MRP1 , LRP ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ) isozyme ( alpha , epsilon , eta , theta , tau , zeta ) corresponding genes in A2780 ovarian cancer cells after a 24-hour treatment with adriamycin ( ADR ) , camptothecin ( CAM ) , etoposide ( ETO ) or vincristine ( VCR ) . Sublethal concentrations of drugs were used to exclude short-term effects caused by selection . Cell cycle analysis was performed to identify possible correlation between resistance factors , PKC isozymes and proliferation . We found a mostly combined induction of MDR1 , LRP , PKC tau and PKC zeta by CAM , ETO and VCR . PKC alpha , epsilon , eta and theta gene expression altered variably . Cell cycle analysis showed that A2780 cells responded with a marked G2/M arrest after a 24-hour treatment with CAM , ETO and VCR but an association between the induction of PKC isozymes corresponding genes and proliferation was not seen . Our analysis points to a possible link between atypical PKC tau/PKC zeta and MDR1/LRP in cytostatic stress response of cancer cells .
Recent reports provide evidence that some growth factors behave as inhibitors of the apoptosis of the endothelial cells , bringing forward the concept of vascular survival as a post-angiogenesis process . At least two different vasculature development processes occur within a tumor : the angiogenic ( formation of new vessels ) and the vascular survival pathway , which is devoted to the preservation of the newly-formed vessels in layers that lose contact with the adjacent normal tissue . We developed a method to assess these processes in tissue samples . We noted that differences among tumors may exist not only in the tumor angiogenic activity ( TAA ) but also in the vascular survival ability ( VSA ) . One third of the highly angiogenic breast cancer cases examined had a poor ability to maintain high vessel density in inner tumor areas . Both parameters are independently related to prognosis , while VSA was directly related to tumor dimensions and node involvement . Patients with high TAA and VSA had a particularly poor prognosis . It is suggested that although cancer angiogenic activity is important for the local invasion and dissemination into vessels and lymphatics , the VSA may be important for the effective formation of viable tumor foci in lymph nodes or distant organs . Recognition and quantification of the vascular survival ability in human tumors may significantly improve the prognostic value of the assessment of tumor vasculature , and may help to stratify patients for clinical trials with novel anti-angiogenic or angiotoxic drugs . Elucidation of the pathways may provide additional targets for antiangiogenic therapy .
Steroid hormone receptors , including estrogen receptor-alpha ( ERalpha ) , are ligand-activated transcription factors , and hormone binding leads to depletion of receptor levels via preteasome-mediated degradation . NEDD8 ( neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated ) is an ubiquitin-like protein essential for protein processing and cell cycle progression . We recently demonstrated that ubiquitin-activating enzyme ( Uba)3 , the catalytic subunit of the NEDD8-activating enzyme , inhibits ERalpha transcriptional activity . Here we report that Uba3-mediated inhibition of ERalpha transactivation function is due to increased receptor protein turnover . Coexpression of Uba3 with ERalpha increased receptor degradation by the 26S proteasome . Inhibition of NEDD8 activation and conjugation diminished polyubiquitination of ERalpha and blocked proteasome-mediated degradation of receptor protein . The antiestrogen ICI 182,780 is known to induce ER degradation . In human MCF7 breast cancer cells modified to contain a disrupted NEDD8 pathway , ICI 182,780 degradation of ERalpha was impaired , and the antiestrogen was ineffective at inhibiting cell proliferation . This study provides the first evidence linking nuclear receptor degradation with the NEDD8 pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome system , suggesting that the two pathways can act together to modulate ERalpha turnover and cellular responses to estrogens . Based on our observation that an intact NEDD8 pathway is essential for the antiproliferation activity of the ICI 182,780 in ERalpha positive breast cancer cells , we propose that disruptions in the NEDD8 pathway provide a mechanism by which breast cancer cells acquire antiestrogen resistance while retaining expression of ERalpha .
PURPOSE The difference in radiosensitivity between two isogenic tumour cell lines was evaluated to determine whether factors such as sublethal and potentially damage repair , DNA double-strand break repair and fidelity of repair can be related to differences in radiosensitivity . MATERIALS AND METHODS The cell lines used were the ovarian carcinoma A2780s and a radiation-resistant derivative A2780cp . Radiation response was measured in terms of cell survival , recovery of sublethal ( SLD ) and potentially lethal damage ( PLD ) , induction of and recovery of DNA strand breaks , and fidelity of DNA repair using a cell-free plasmid assay . RESULTS While A2780cp was more resistant to radiation than A2780s , it showed less ability for recovery of SLD and PLD . DNA strand-break induction was the same for both cell lines , while only at very high doses did A2780cp show greater DNA strand-break recovery than A2780s . Fidelity of rejoining DNA was significantly higher in the A2780cp cell line . CONCLUSION The difference in radiosensitivity between these two cell lines was not related to recovery of PLD or SLD or to the induction of DNA damage . It appears that fidelity of DNA rejoining , which was significantly higher in the resistant cell line , may be related to the difference in radiosensitivity .
PURPOSE Mitotic cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation , exhibiting single-hit inactivation coefficients near to those of repair deficient cell lines and lymphocytes . To elucidate possible mechanisms for this hypersensitivity , the kinetics of oxygen radiosensitization , the proportion of indirect effect by OH radicals and the kinetics of radiation-induced DNA strand breakage in the chromatin of mitotic cells were investigated . MATERIALS AND METHODS Synchronized populations of >90% mitotic HT-29 cells were obtained by the mitotic shake-off method . Cells were irradiated at < or =4 degrees C with ( 137)Cs gamma-rays . Cellular oxygen concentration was varied by gassing cell suspensions prior to and during irradiation with mixtures of pure N(2) that contained 5% CO(2) and measured quantities of O(2) . The indirect effect of OH radicals was investigated with the radical scavenger , DMSO . DNA strand breakage was measured by the comet assay . RESULTS Mitotic HT-29 cell inactivation is well described by a single-hit inactivation coefficient ( alpha ) of 1.14 +/- 0.06 Gy(-1) . The oxygen enhancement ratio of mitotic cells ( at 10% survival ) was found to be approximately 2.0 , significantly lower than the value of 2.8 measured for interphase ( asynchronous ) cells . More than 60% of mitotic cell killing was eliminated when the media contained 2 M DMSO , indicating that indirect effect is as important in the killing of mitotic cells as it is for interphase cells . The chromatin in mitotic cells was found to be times more sensitive to radiation-induced DNA single-strand breakage than the chromatin of interphase cells . CONCLUSIONS The alpha-inactivation coefficient of mitotic HT-29 cells was times larger than that of interphase cells . Mitotic cell chromatin appears to contain intrinsic DNA breaks that are not lethal . In addition , chromatin in mitotic cells was found to be more susceptible to radiation-induced DNA strand-breakage than the dispersed chromatin of interphase cells . How the enhanced production of these simple DNA lesions ( that are usually reparable ) translates into the lethal ( non-reparable ) events associated with alpha-inactivation is not known . The compaction/dispersion status of DNA throughout the cell cycle appears to be an important factor for determining intrinsic cell radiosensitivity and might be manipulated for radiotherapeutic advantage .
The effects of tea polyphenols and tea pigments on cell cycle of hepatic cancer cells were studied . HepG2 cells were incubated with 50 and 100 mg/L tea polyphenols and tea pigments for 48 h respectively . Flow cytometry , Western blot and RT-PCR analysis were used . Flow cytometry analysis showed that tea polyphenols and tea pigments induced G1 arrest . Western blot analysis showed tea polyphenols and tea pigments significantly inhibited the expression of cyclin D1 protein and induced higher expression of P21WAFI/CIPI protein . The result of RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that Cdk4 was significantly inhibited by tea polyphenols and tea pigments . It is concluded that the induction of cell cycle arrest may be an important mechanism of tea on cancer prevention .
OBJECTIVE To investigate the expression and mutation of MTA1 , nm23H1 and E-cadherin(E-cad) genes in ovarian carcinoma ( OC ) in relation to lymph node ( LN ) metastasis . METHODS A panel of normal ovarian tissues , primary OC specimens and corresponding LNS was examined for mRNA expression and mutation of MTA1 and nm23H1 and protin expression of E-cad genes by using RT-PCR , RT-PCR-SSCP and immunohistochemistry . RESULTS The frequency of MTA1 over expression was 100%(7/7) in primary OC with metastasis but only 38.5%(5/13) in those without metastasis ( P = 0.0103 ) . Overexpression of MTA1 was observed in 87.5%(6/7) of LNS with metastasis but in only 23%(3/13) of LNS without metastasis ( P = 0.0118 ) . In contrast with MTA1 , low expression of nm23H1 mRNA was seen in 7 of 7 OC with metastasis but only in 4 of 13(30%) of those without metastasis ( P = 0.0043 ) . Low nm23H1 expression was also seen in 7 of 7 LNS with metastasis but only in 5 of 13 ( 38.5% ) nonmetastatic LNS ( P = 0.0102 ) . Meantime , no expression of E-cad protein was observed in 7 of 7 OC with metastasis but in 6 of 13(46.2%) of those without metastasis ( P = 0.044 ) . In correlation analysis of the three genes , MTA1 reversely correlated with nm23H1 and E-cad respectively ( r = -0.903 , -0.803 ) , and positive correlation existed between nm23H1 and E-cad ( r = 0.724 ) . No mutation of MTA1 , nm23H1 and was found by SSCP analysis . CONCLUSION The mRNA expression of MTA1 , nm23H1 and E-cad is positively and negatively correlated with LN metastasis . The expression abnormalities but not the mutations of the three genes are frequent events related to LN metastasis of ovarian cancer .
Modulation of the balance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors holds great promise for the treatment of a broad spectrum of human disease ranging from ischemic heart disease to cancer . This requires both the identification of angiogenic regulators and their efficient delivery to target organs . Here , we demonstrate the use of a noncatalytic fragment of matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( termed PEX ) delivered by lentiviral vectors in different angiogenesis models . Transduction of human endothelial cells with PEX virus suppressed endothelial invasion and formation of capillary-like structures without affecting chemotaxis in vitro . Lentiviral delivery of PEX blocked basic fibroblast growth factor-induced matrix metalloproteinase 2 activation and angiogenesis on chicken chorioallantoic membranes . PEX expression also inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis and tumor growth in a nude mouse model . Thus , our study shows that lentiviral vectors can deliver sufficient quantities of antiangiogenic substances to achieve therapeutic effects in vivo .
The anti-breast cancer drug tamoxifen has recently been shown to cause an increase in intracellular free-Ca(2+) concentrations ( [ Ca(2+)](i) ) in renal tubular cells , breast cells and bladder cells . Because tamoxifen is known to alter ovary function in human patients and in rats , the present study was aimed at exploring whether tamoxifen could alter Ca(2+) movement in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO-K1 ) cells . Cytosolic free-Ca(2+) levels in populations of cells have been explored by using fura-2 as a fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator . Tamoxifen at concentrations above 1 micro M increased [ Ca(2+)](i) in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC(50) value of 8 micro M. The Ca(2+) signal was reduced by removing extracellular Ca(2+) , but was not affected by nifedipine , verapamil , diltiazem or ICI 182,780 ( an estrogen receptor antagonist ) . Pretreatment with 1 micro M thapsigargin ( an endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor ) to deplete the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) abolished 10 micro M tamoxifen-induced Ca(2+) release . Neither inhibition of phospholipase C with 2 micro M U73122 nor depletion of ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) stores with 50 micro M ryanodine affected tamoxifen-induced Ca(2+) release . Cell proliferation assays using ELISA revealed that overnight incubation with 5-10 micro M tamoxifen inhibited cell proliferation by 20% , and 20 micro M tamoxifen killed all cells . Together , the results suggest that , in CHO-K1 cells , tamoxifen induced a [ Ca(2+)](i) increase by causing store-Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum in an phospholipase C-independent manner , and by inducing Ca(2+) influx . The action of tamoxifen appears to be dissociated from estrogen receptor activation . Longer incubation with tamoxifen ( >5 micro M ) was cytotoxic .
The identification of molecular markers related to critical biological processes during carcinogenesis may aid in the evaluation of carcinogenic potentials of chemicals and chemical mixtures . Work from our laboratory demonstrated that a single treatment with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine ( MNNG ) enhanced spontaneous malignant transformation of the human keratinocyte cell line RHEK-1 . In contrast , chronic low-level exposure of cells to arsenic alone or in a mixture containing arsenic , cadmium , chromium , and lead inhibited malignant conversion . To identify changes in gene expression that influence these different outcomes , cDNA microarray technology was used . Analysis of multiple human arrays in MNNG-transformed RHEK-1 cells , designated OM3 , and those treated with arsenic or the arsenic-containing metal mixture showed unique patterns of gene expression . Genes that were overexpressed in OM3 included oncogenes , cell cycle regulators , and those involved in signal transduction , whereas genes for DNA repair enzymes and inhibitors of transformation and metastasis were suppressed . In arsenic-treated cells , multiple DNA repair proteins were overexpressed . Mixture-treated cells showed increased expression of a variety of genes including metallothioneins and integrin 4 . These cells showed decreased expression of oncogenes , DNA repair proteins , and genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway . For comparison we are currently analyzing gene expression changes in RHEK-1 cells transformed by other means . The goal of these studies is to identify common batteries of genes affected by chemical modulators of the carcinogenic process . Mechanistic studies may allow us to correlate alterations in their expression with sequential stages in the carcinogenic process and may aid in the risk assessment of other xenobiotics .
Previously we have found deregulation of collagen metabolism in human pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer tissues . Insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) is known to stimulate collagen biosynthesis through interaction with IGF-I receptor . IGF-I binding proteins ( BPs ) regulate the activity of IGF-I . We investigated whether serum and tissue IGF-I and IGF-BPs as well as tissue IGF-I receptor expression may reflect disturbances of collagen metabolism in patients with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer . In pancreatitis tissue , a significant increase in IGF-I and IGFBP-3 content was accompanied by a distinct increase in IGF-I receptor expression , compared to control pancreas tissue . In contrast , serum from patients with pancreatitis did not show significant increases in IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels , however , significant increases in IGFBP-1 level ( 2.5 fold ) . Moreover , a distinct decrease in radioactive IGF-binding to the BPs , compared to control serum , was found . Pancreatic cancer tissue and serum of patients with pancreatic cancer showed significant increases in IGF-I , IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-1 content , accompanied by dramatic increases in IGF-I tissue receptor expression , compared to controls . In serum of patients with pancreatic cancer distinct increases in radioactive IGF-binding to 46 kDa BP , compared to control serum , were observed . The data suggest that disturbances in tissue collagen metabolism during pancreatic diseases may result from deregulation of IGF-I homeostasis and that elevated serum levels of IGF-I , IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-1 may serve as markers of pancreatic cancer .
The epidemiologic association between asbestos exposure and human malignant mesothelioma is well established . However , the molecular mechanisms linking asbestos exposure of humans and the subsequent mesothelioma formation is not well understood . The most frequent genetic changes found so far in human malignant mesothelioma ( HMM ) are deletions and point mutations in the tumor suppressor genes p16INK4a and NF2 . Whereas homozygous deletions appear to be the predominant mechanism leading to p16/CDKN2A inactivation , inactivating point mutations coupled with allelic loss mainly occur at the NF2 locus . In the present study , asbestos-treated human mesothelial cells ( HMC ) , SV40-transformed human mesothelial cells ( MeT-5A ) and a human mesothelioma cell line ( COLO ) were investigated for genetic changes of cell cycle genes ( cyclin D1 , p16INK4a , RB1 , CDK2 ) using multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization ( mFISH ) in interphase cells . The results show that cyclin D1 is unaffected in all investigated cells . The p16INK4a gene locus was shown to be mutated in COLO cells but not in HMC . After labeling of CDK2 and RB1 , hemizygous loss of one allele of each gene was observed in asbestos-treated HMC whereas gene amplification of these genes was detectable in MeT-5A and COLO cells . Our data indicate that disarrangement of the RB1 dependent pathway seems to be involved in mesothelioma formation .
The early stages of head and neck cancer are presumed to require a senes of genetic alterations that are not represented by a distinct clinical phenotype . Therefore , genes with altered expression in the preneoplasia may be useful for the early detection of this highly recurrent cancer . In this study , we immortalized normal human oral keratinocytes ( NHOK ) by retroviral-mediated infection of HPV 16 transforming oncogenes , E6 and E7 ( HOK16E6E7 ) . Using the Affymetrix gene chip ( U95Av2 ) , we identified 177 known genes and EST that were overexpressed at least 3-fold or above in the immortalized cells , while 133 were down-regulated compared to NHOK . Northern blot analysis showed elevated levels of p55CDC in the immortalized cells , while NHOK showed high basal expression of small proline rich protein ( SPRR2 ) . The altered expression of these genes maybe associated with cellular proliferation or differentiation and the early stages of oral carcinogenesis .
BACKGROUND Angiogenesis is of crucial importance for tumor growth and development of metastases . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) has a potent angiogenic activity and mutations of the p53 gene has been thought to upregulate VEGF . The purpose of our study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of these tumor biomarkers for angiogenesis relative to the information derived from established clinicopathological parameters in gastric cancer . METHODS In this study , we conducted an immunohistochemical investigation of VEGF and p53 expression in 145 tissue samples obtained from gastric cancer patients undergoing curative surgical treatment . To evaluate angiogenesis , microvessel density ( MVD ) was counted by staining endothelial cells immunohistochemically using anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody . RESULTS High MVD was significantly associated with depth of tumor invasion and distant metastasis ( p = 0.004 , 0.021 , respectively ) . Moreover , overall survival for patients with high MVD were significantly lower than that of low MVD ( p = 0.048 ) . Positive expression of VEGF correlated significantly with lymph node and distant metastasis ( p = 0.040 , 0.048 , respectively ) . However , no significant correlation was found between p53 expression and various clinicopathological parameters . VEGF positive tumors showed a higher MVD than VEGF negative tumors ( p = 0.028 ) . The expression of p53 did not correlate with VEGF expression . Also , the relationship between the status of p53 expression and MVD had not statistically significant differences . In the multivariate analysis , status of VEGF , p53 expression and MVD were not an independent prognostic factor . CONCLUSION VEGF seems to be an important , clinically relevant inducer of angiogenesis and angiogenesis assessed by the MVD may be a useful marker for predicting metastasis in gastric cancer . However , further studies are warranted to clarify the impact of p53 on the angiogenesis and the prognostic significance of angiogenesis in gastric cancer .
To elucidate role of the three enzymes in hepatocarcinogenesis , hMTH1 , hOGG1 and hMYH , mRNA expression were examined by using RT/semi-quantitative real-time PCR and 8-O-HdG levels was studied by HPLC/ECD in HCC and non-tumorous liver tissue of 21 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . It was found that the 8-OHdG level in non-tumourous liver tissue was significantly higher than in HCC tissue ( P = 0.006 ) , and this was correlated with the degree of inflammation . The hMTH1 expression in HCC tissue was significantly higher than in non-tumorous liver tissue ( P = 0.014 ) . Inversely , The hMYH alpha expression was significantly increased ( P = 0.039 ) in non-tumorous liver tissue . No difference was seen in hOGG1 expression in non-tumorous liver and HCC tissue . A significant linear correlation between hMTH1 and hOGG1 expression was found both in HCC tissue ( r = 0.809 , P < 0.001 ) and in non-tumorous liver tissue ( r = 0.883 , P < 0.001 ) . Our findings suggested a reactive rather than pathogenic role of the DNA repair enzymes in the hepatocarcinogenesis .
In the course of a medicinal chemistry program aimed at discovering novel tumour-active rebeccamycin derivatives targeting DNA and/or topoisomerase I , a series of analogues with the sugar residue linked to the two indole nitrogens was recently developed . Two promising drug candidates in this staurosporine-rebeccamycin hybrid series were selected for a DNA-binding study reported here . The DNA interaction of the cationic indolocarbazole glycosides MP059 bearing a N,N-diethylaminoethyl side chain and MP072 containing a sugar bearing an amino group was compared with that of the uncharged analogue MP024 . The results show that the addition of a cationic substituent , either directly on the indolocarbazole chromophore or on the carbohydrate residue , significantly reinforces the interaction of the drugs with nucleic acids . The two cationic molecules MP059 and MP072 recognise preferentially sequences containing GpT.ApC and TpG.CpA steps but they do not inhibit topoisomerase I , in contrast to the parent uncharged derivative MP024 which stimulates DNA single strand breaks by topoisomerase I. The cytotoxic activity of the indolocarbazole derivatives bearing positively charged groups is one order of magnitude higher than that of the neutral compound MP024 . The high cytotoxic potential can be attributed to the enhanced DNA binding and sequence recognition capacity of the cationic compounds . The study provides useful information for further structure-activity relationship studies in the indolocarbazole series .
Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid ( AKBA ) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene isolated from the gum resin exudate from the stem of the tree Boswellia serrata ( frankincense ) . AKBA has been recently identified as a novel , orally active , non-redox and non-competitive 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor that also inhibits topisomerase I and II in vitro . Because natural pentacyclic triterpenes have an antiproliferative effect against different tumor types , we investigated the effects of AKBA on the proliferation of 11 primary cell cultures established from human surgical specimens of meningiomas , common central nervous system tumors . Treatment of meningioma cells by AKBA revealed a potent cytotoxic activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations in the range of 2-8 microM . At similar , physiologically achievable concentrations , AKBA rapidly ( within minutes ) and potently inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 ( Erk-1 and Erk-2 ) in meningioma cells stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor BB . High expression level of 5-LO was detected in primary meningioma cells and surgical specimens by immunoblotting analysis , suggesting the possible role of 5-LO in meningioma tumorigenesis . Considering the critical importance of the Erk-1/2 signal transduction pathway not only in meningiomas but in other human neoplasms , the interruption of signaling through this evolutionarily conserved pathway might be one of the mechanisms by which AKBA induces suppression of proliferation and apoptosis of different tumor types .
Neutrophils have become recognised as important contributors to the effectiveness of tumour eradication by photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) . In this study , we have used the mouse SCCVII squamous cell carcinoma model to investigate the activity of neutrophils in tumours treated by PDT . Tumour levels of neutrophilic myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) demonstrated not only a massive and sustained sequestration of these cells in PDT-treated tumours but also revealed their activated state evidenced by the presence of released MPO . Among the adhesion molecules expressed on tumour vascular endothelium , ICAM-1 appears to be of primary importance in the invasion of neutrophils into PDT-treated tumours , because its functional blocking with monoclonal antibodies reduced the tumour cure rate . A marked upregulation of its ligands CD11b/CD18 and CD11c/CD18 found on neutrophils associated with PDT-treated tumours supports this assumption . To evaluate the role of inflammatory cytokines regulating neutrophil activity , neutralising antibodies were given to mice before PDT treatment . The results suggest that IL-1beta activity is critical for the therapeutic outcome , since its neutralisation diminished the cure rates of PDT-treated tumours . No significant effect was observed with anti-IL-6 and anti-TNF-alpha treatment . Further flow cytometry-based examination of neutrophils round in PDT-treated tumours revealed that these cells express MHC class II molecules , which suggests their engagement as antigen-presenting cells and involvement in the development of antitumour immune response .
Common use of antimutagens and anticarcinogens in everyday life is an effective measure for preventing human cancer and genetic diseases . Antioxidant properties of tea have vast potential as protective agents against diverse toxic effects . The present study was aimed to evaluate the role of aqueous clonal tea extracts ( green tea , oolong tea and black tea ) in modulating the genotoxic damage induced by cyclophosphamide ( CP ) , a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug and a well-known mutagen and clastogen . All the three tea extracts at 1 and 2% concentration did not increase the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes ( MPE ) in bone marrow cells of mice when administered individually . The tea extracts decreased the micronuclei ( MN ) induced by CP . Therefore , regular intake of tea may improve the antioxidant status in in vivo and thereby reduce the risk of cancer and coronary heart disease .
A comparative study was undertaken between cancer of the uterine cervix ( n = 50 ) and female breast cancer ( n = 50 ) with reference to the expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein ( HER-2/neu ) and that of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGF-R ) , both being highly homologous structurally . Expressions of EGF-R and c-erbB-2 oncoprotein were viewed in breast and cervical cancer tissues by immunochemical staining . Cervical cancer cases showed much higher expression of EGF-R which also revealed significant association with the expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein and tumour grading . Among breast cancer cases , over-expression of EGF-R correlated significantly with metastasis of lymph node ; and expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein showed a significant relationship with histological grading of the tumour . Moreover , an association was noticed between the tumour grade and the concomitant immuno positive expression of EGF-R and c-erbB-2 . Our study revealed an existence of a conflicting pattern in the expression of EGF-R and c-erbB-2 oncoprotein between carcinomas of the breast and uterine cervix .
Cell lines of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( T-ALL ) have gained high interest for study of mechanisms of cytostatic drug resistance . However , they should also be suited to examine the validity and reliability of molecular cytogenetic techniques in detecting genomic alterations in neoplastic cells . Therefore , comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) and 24-color-fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization ( M-FISH ) were applied to eight sublines of CCRF-CEM leukemia cells selected in vitro for drug resistance and to their drug-sensitive parental counterparts . All cell lines were characterized by altered chromosome numbers and by a variety of chromosomal structural aberrations as shown by M-FISH . The great majority of anomalies detected by this technique were confirmed by CGH . Interestingly , a considerable number of the rearrangements found were imbalanced . Amplifications of 5q13 in the six methotrexate-resistant cell lines , a del(9)(p21pter) in all lines examined , and a gain of chromosome 20 in 9 of the 10 lines examined were readily detected by both techniques . The same held true for losses of chromosomes 17 and 18 in the near tetraploid cell lines which could also be confirmed by CGH . Some imbalances of genomic material detected by CGH were , however , not observed by means of M-FISH , possibly due to the limited extension of the corresponding chromosomal segment involved or the small subpopulation of cells affected . On the other hand , reciprocal translocations , balanced isochromosomes , and small deletions remained mainly undetected by CGH . A comparison of chromosomal alterations in drug-resistant and parental cell lines showed not only amplifications of chromosomal segments harboring well-known drug resistance genes , e.g. , the dihydrofolate reductase gene , but also chromosomal changes which may involve novel genes associated with drug resistance . Thus , the present study has clearly unveiled the strengths and weaknesses of both techniques which can excellently complement each other . Their combination allowed a distinct improvement of the definition of the complex karyotypes of drug-resistant cell lines .
INTRODUCTION Cell-cell interaction is an essential component of atherosclerotic plaque development . Activated monocytes appear to play a central role in the development of atherosclerosis , not only through foam cell formation but also via the production of various growth factors that induce proliferation of different cell types that are involved in the plaque development . Using serum free co-culture method , we determined the effect of monocytes on endothelial cell proliferation . METHODS Endothelial cell proliferation is determined by the amount of [ 3H]thymidine incorporated in to the DNA . Basic fibroblast growth factor ( b-FGF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) levels in the conditioned medium were determined by ELISA . RESULTS Conditioned medium from unactivated monocytes partially inhibited endothelial cell proliferation , whereas conditioned medium from activated monocytes promoted endothelial cell proliferation . The mitogenic effect of conditioned medium derived from activated monocytes is due to the presence of b-FGF , VEGF and IL-8 . Neutralizing antibodies against b-FGF , VEGF and IL-8 partially reversed the mitogenic effect of conditioned medium derived from activated monocytes . When b-FGF , VEGF and IL-8 were immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium derived from activated monocytes , it is less mitogenic to endothelial cells . CONCLUSION Activated monocytes may play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic plaque by producing endothelial cell growth factors .
Contradictory results have been reported regarding the association between vascularity ( used as an index of angiogenesis ) and thrombospondin-1 ( TSP-1 ) in human tumours . In previous studies , the reported association was based on the estimated average TSP-1 value per tumour , with a sufficient number of specimens collectively analysed per tumour type . Given the extent of intra-tumour heterogeneity , we determined the association between TSP-1 and vascularity within individual specimens , based on the average values of TSP-1 and vascularity in 10-20 pre-selected areas per tumour . Cells expressing TSP-1 mRNA were visualised by in situ hybridisation and quantified by point counting . Vascularity was quantified by point counting and vessel density of von Willebrand Factor-positive vessels . In 10 ductal breast carcinomas , a direct correlation between TSP-1 and vascularity was found in 4 tumours , no correlation in 3 and an inverse correlation in 3 . The effect of TSP-1 on endothelial cell migration in vitro was assessed in the Boyden chamber assay . TSP-1 stimulated cell migration at low concentrations ( 0.1-10 microg/ml ) and was inhibitory at high concentrations ( 25-100 microg/ml ) . These results suggest that TSP-1 may elicit a concentration-dependent , bi-phasic , effect on angiogenesis .
There is little understanding of the factors controlling the mobilization of blast cells from bone marrow to peripheral blood and tissues . The aim of this study was to evaluate the soluble hepatocyte growth factor ( sHGF ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( sVEGF ) levels in newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) and to correlate these levels with the clinico-pathological features . Sixty-three patients with AML and 15 normal controls were included in this study . The levels of sHGF and sVEGF were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay at diagnosis and after remission induction chemotherapy . Our results revealed significantly increased plasma levels of sHGF and sVEGF at diagnosis when compared to both control and remission levels ( P=0.000 for both ) . The sHGF and sVEGF levels differed between AML FAB subtypes ( P=0.000 ) . The highest concentrations were found in M5 followed by M4 . SHGF and sVEGF were directly correlated with peripheral white cell counts ( WBC ) ( r=0.836 , P=0.000 , r=0.718 ; P=0.000 , respectively ) , but inversely correlated with blast cell distribution ratio ( BCDR ) ( r=-0.785 , P=0.000 , r=-0.664 , P=0.000 , respectively ) . Moreover , both sHGF and sVEGF levels were significantly elevated in AML patients with extra-medullary infiltration as compared to those without ( P=0.000 , 0.006 , respectively ) . The sHGF but not sVEGF levels were significantly elevated in patients who died compared to those who relapsed and to patients in complete remission ( P=0.02 , 0.08 , respectively ) . Logistic regression analysis revealed that the sHGF level at diagnoses is a powerful predictor of the patient outcome , compared to sVEGF . In conclusion : our data support the hypothesis that angiogenic factors play a functional role in blast cell movement from the bone marrow to peripheral tissues . Assessment of sHGF at AML diagnosis is likely to be helpful in predicting patient outcome and selecting optimal therapeutic regimen .
We present a new cell line , EJ established from an invasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus in a 56-year-old patient . The cells show rapid growth in culture with a doubling time of 16 h and high migration activity . Monolayer-cultured cells were polygonal in shape showing a tendency to pile up without contact inhibition . Subcutaneous transplantation of the EJ cells into nude mice formed solid tumors that were histologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma , whereas no metastasis was observed . Cultured EJ cells produced tissue polypeptide antigen ( IPA ) . Genetic and molecular analyses revealed high telomerase activity but not estrogen receptor alpha expression . Using the DNA sequencing technique , we have screened EJ cells for p53 mutation in exon 5 to 8 but no mutation of p53 was observed . This cell line appears to represent the development of a more malignant clone with divergent receptor function and growth behavior , and provides us with an interesting new tool for the study of tumorigenesis in the human endometrium .
We have studied the mutagenic specificity of abasic sites using the yeast oligonucleotides transformation assay . We introduced oligonucleotide containing a natural abasic site and a tetrahydrofuran abasic site into Rev1 mutants , rev1AA , which contains mutations of Asp467 and Glu468 residues of Rev1p to Ala in order to inactivate dCMP transferase activity , and rev1 delta , which lacks its whole coding sequence . The transformation efficiencies of rev1AA with abasic-containing oligonucleotides were lower than those of B7528 , a strain proficient in REV1 gene , but much higher than rev1 delta mutant . Sequence analysis opposite the lesions showed that the mutation spectra were different among these three strains .
Vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) and its receptor tyrosine kinases located on endothelial cells seem to play an important role in the multistep pathway of angiogenesis . SU5416 is a small molecule which inhibits angiogenesis by acting as an inhibitor of VEGF receptor-2 tyrosine kinase . We have developed a reproducible murine model for neuroblastoma , a childhood cancer , based on s.c. xenotransplantation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells . We found that SH-SY5Y cells expressed VEGF-A on both the mRNA and protein levels , that plasma concentrations of VEGF-A were significantly elevated in animals with neuroblastoma with a volume > 1.4 ml , and that there was a correlation between VEGF-A levels in plasma and tumor size in untreated tumor-bearing animals . Treatment with SU5416 reduced the growth of neuroblastoma tumors by 65% without apparent toxicity . SU5416 treatment also suppressed tumor angiogenesis , despite an increase in plasma VEGF-A levels per ml tumor volume during therapy . Our experimental data suggest that the angiogenesis inhibitor SU5416 may be beneficial in the treatment of solid tumors of childhood such as neuroblastoma .
We wanted to investigate the effects of gamma radiation on DNA single-strand breaks ( SSB ) and glutathione ( GSH ) levels in mononuclear blood cells ( MNC ) of radiotherapy technicians . DNA SSB in MNC of radiotherapy technicians who use ( 60)Co-gamma source in their works were detected by alkaline filter elution and compared to control subjects . In addition , GSH levels were measured using the enzymatic method in MNC . Blood samples were collected from radiotherapy technicians on Monday and Friday . DNA SSB levels were found to be significantly higher in smoking controls compared to non-smoking controls . Significant increases of 36% and 49% in DNA SSB were detected from Monday to Friday for non-smoking and smoking radiotherapy technicians , respectively . GSH levels were found to be decreased significantly from Monday to Friday . Gamma-radiation resulted in increased DNA SSB levels of MNC in radiotherapy technicians throughout the working week and these breaks have been observed to be repaired at the weekend . Smoking habit caused an additional increase in the SSBs observed in radiotherapy technicians .
OBJECTIVE To study the effects of angiostatin(AS) gene mediated by liposome on human pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990 . METHODS Angiostatin gene was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV . The recombinant of pRC/CMV-AS was introduced into the pancreatic cancer cell line , SW1990 . The mechanism of anti-tumor was studied and tested . RESULTS The eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV-AS was identified by the restriction digest. pRC/CMV-AS was stably integrated into the target cells and expressed by Western blot and drug-sensitivity tests , and inhibited the vascular endothelial cells proliferation in vitro . In addition , the effects of the angiostatin vector on reducing the volume of tumors implanted in nude mouse models were also noted . CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that the recombinant pRC/CMV-AS mediated by liposome may play a potential role in the treatment of pancreatic cancer in the future .
Contrary to the paradigm that cancer incidence increases indefinitely with age , significant data now suggest cancer incidence may markedly reduce beyond age 80 years for humans and beyond 800 days for mice , and is not inevitable . We show that increasing cellular senescence with age is a possible cause of this reduction , since senescent cells are removed from the pool of cells that retain proliferative ability necessary for cancer . We further show that animal interventions appearing to alter senescence , p53 mutation and melatonin dosing , support the prediction that increasing senescence rate reduces cancer while reducing lifespan , and vice versa . Studies of environmental agents associated with increased cancer might be re-examined to find if there is an association with longevity increases , which may markedly alter our view of such agents . We also show that if an agent functions by slowing both senescence and carcinogenesis , longevity is increased while reducing cancer . Dietary restriction is the only known intervention that accomplishes this , but there may be others .
In mice fed a diet supplemented with red clover isoflavones the prostatic epithelium displays a significant increase in the production of estrogen receptor beta and the adhesion protein E-cadherin but a decrease in transforming growth factor beta1 . These proteins are estrogenically-induced markers of proliferation , maintenance of histological architecture , preservation of cell phenotype and reduction of the potential for neoplastic and metastatic transformation . This study suggests that red clover isoflavones represent a non-toxic dietary treatment for prostatic hyperplasia and a reduction in the potential for neoplastic transformation .
The immune system has an important role in tumor appearance and spreading . One of the most efficient subpopulations of cytotoxic cells in the destruction of tumors are NK cells . NK cells are activated and increase their cytotoxic potential and modulate their cytokine production after treatment with IFNgamma , IL-12 , TNFalpha and IL-2 . The investigation of the activity of NK cells was performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) of 16 healthy controls and of 40 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma . Modulation of NK cells was performed with IL-2 , IL-7 , IL-12 , TNFalpha , monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) for TNFalpha and TNFalpha receptors type I and II , as well as with sera of healthy controls and patients with breast cancer in different clinical stages . Modulating effect of the applied factors after in vitro treatment of PBL was evaluated by the cytotoxic assay using 51chromium . Our results indicate that IL-2 significantly increased the activity of NK cells of controls and breast cancer patients . The sera of patients with advanced breast cancer significantly reduced NK cell activity . IL-7 , IL-12 and mAb for TNFalpha do not significantly change the activity of NK cells . The presence of anti-TNFalpha mAb did not change the inhibitory effect of the sera of breast cancer patients with advanced disease on the activity of NK cells of controls and patients with breast cancer . Blocking of TNFalpha Rcs with mAbs decrease the reactivity of NK cells for IL-2 . The treatment of breast cancer patients with advanced clinical stage of breast cancer with IL-2 , as an additional therapy , could be advantageous , as NK cells after this treatment increase their cytotoxic activity against tumor cells and can improve therapeutical results .
The study focuses on the effects of combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) on the onset of cervical dysplasia among Zimbabwean women . Women who had used COCs for at least 2 years and were in continued use were compared to non-users of COCs ( control group ) . It was difficult to establish the average period of contraceptive use because in most instances there was no proper documentation on the exact dates as to when the subjects started using COCs . The number of subjects with each condition was noted from each of the following age groups ; <20 years , 20-29years , 30-39years , 40-49years and >50years . It was found that the percentage of the control group with benign conditions was higher than that of COC users in all age groups . Significant differences at 95 percent confidence level were noted for the 20-29 years age group ( z= -2.21 ) and 40-49 years age group ( z= -2.53).The number of subjects in the <20 years and >50 years age groups were too small for z-score computation . No significant differences were noted for mild to moderate cervical inflammation in all age groups . There was a higher percentage of COC users with severe cervical inflammation compared to the control group in all age groups . Significant differences were noted in the 30-39 years age group ( z=3.45 ) and 40-49 years age group ( z= 1.98 ) . A higher percentage of CIN I was noted among pooled COC users compared to the control group ( z= 2.00 ) although no significant differences were obtained within different age groups . In conclusion , severe cervical inflammation and CIN I are more frequent among Zimbabwean women who use COCs as compared to non-users of COCs . Frequencies of advanced CIN are low among women who undergo routine cytological screening because this enables early detection and subsequent treatment .
ABSTRACT Partial DNA fragments of Botrytis cinerea field isolates encoding the putative osmosensor histidine kinase gene ( BcOS1 ) were cloned by polymerase chain reaction amplification and the predicted amino acid sequences were compared between dicarboximide-sensitive and resistant field isolates . The predicted BcOS1p is highly homologous to osmosensor histidine kinase OS1p from Neurospora crassa including the N-terminal six tandem repeats of approximately 90 amino acids . Four dicarboximide-resistant isolates of B. cinerea ( Bc-19 , Bc-45 , Bc-682 , and Bc-RKR ) contained a single base pair mutation in their BcOS1 gene that resulted in an amino acid substitution in the predicted protein . In these resistant isolates , codon 86 of the second repeat , which encodes an isoleucine residue in sensitive strains , was converted to a codon for serine . The mutation of Botrytis field resistant isolates was located on the second unit of tandem amino acid repeats of BcOS1p , whereas the point mutations of the fifth repeat of OS1p confer resistance to both dicarboximides and phenylpyrroles and also osmotic sensitivity in Neurospora crassa . These results suggest that an amino acid substitution within the second repeat of BcOS1p is responsible for phenotypes of field resistant isolates ( resistant to dicarboximides but sensitive to phenylpyrroles , and normal osmotic sensitivity ) in B. cinerea .
The involvement of iron and inflammation parameters on overall survival in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients was studied . Furthermore , transferrin receptors 1 ( TfR1 ) and ferritin expression in tumor tissue , tumor stroma , and normal lung tissue were analyzed . Iron metabolism and inflammation parameters were determined by automated laboratory measurements at the time of diagnosis . TfR1 and ferritin expression were determined by immuno-histochemical methods . About 50% of patients survived 12 months only . At the time of diagnosis more than half of the patients had anemia and significantly elevated serum ferritin . Iron content of serum ferritin ( ICF ) was below the reference values in 90% of patients . Furthermore , ICF showed positive correlation with iron metabolic parameters and survival but negative correlation with serum ferritin and ESR . The expression of TfR1 and ferritin in tumor cells was observed in 88% or 62% of patients , respectively . Tumor stroma was TfR1 negative and sporadically ferritin positive . Tumor tissue ferritin expression showed negative correlation with serum iron and hematokrit ( Ht ) , and positive correlation with ferritin , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , alpha-1 globulin , and alpha-2 globulin . Positive correlation was found between TfR1 expression in tumor tissue and alpha-globulin . The correlation between TfR1/ferritin expression in tumor tissue and ICF or survival was not observed . Therefore , we conclude that elevated serum ferritin in sera of NSCLC patients is the result of inflammation and oxidative stress rather than body iron overload . Higher expression of ferritin in tumor tissue may be the consequence of iron deficiency or local toxicity induced by environmental factors .
Ferric nitrilotriacetate ( Fe-NTA ) is a potent nephrotoxicant and a renal carcinogen that induces its effect by causing oxidative stress . The present study was undertaken to explore protective effect of silymarin , a flavonolignan from milk thistle ( Silybum marianum ) , against Fe-NTA mediated renal oxidative stress , inflammation and tumor promotion response along with elucidation of the implicated mechanism(s) . Administration of Fe-NTA ( 10 mg/kg bd wt , i.p. ) to Swiss albino mice induced marked oxidative stress in kidney , evident from augmentation in renal metallothionein ( MT ) expression , depletion of glutathione content and activities of antioxidant and phase II metabolizing enzymes , and enhancement in production of aldehyde products such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal . Fe-NTA also significantly activated nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) and upregulated the expression of downstream genes : cyclooxygenase 2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase and enhancing the production of proinflammatory cytokines : tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . However , feeding of 0.5% and 1% silymarin diet conferred a significant protection against Fe-NTA induced oxidative stress and inflammation . It further augmented MT expression , restored the antioxidant armory , ameliorated NFkappaB activation and decreased the expression of proinflammatory mediators . Silymarin also suppressed Fe-NTA induced hyperproliferation in kidney , ameliorating renal ornithine decarboxylase activity and DNA synthesis . From these results , it could be concluded that silymarin markedly protects against chemically induced renal cancer and acts plausibly by virtue of its antioxidant , anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activities .
BACKGROUND & AIMS GUCY2C is the intestinal receptor for the paracrine hormones guanylin and uroguanylin that converts guanosine-5'-triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) . It functions as a tumor suppressor ; its loss disrupts intestinal homeostasis and promotes tumorigenesis . We investigated the effects of GUCY2C loss on intestinal cell proliferation , metabolism , signaling , and tumorigenesis in mice . METHODS Intestinal cell proliferation and metabolism were examined in Gucy2c(-/-) and colon cancer cells by microscopy , immunoblot , and functional analyses . Microarray analyses compared gene expression profiles of intestine cell from Gucy2c(-/-) and wild-type mice. v akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog ( AKT ) regulation and signaling were examined , and the role of AKT in GUCY2C-dependent tumorigenesis was defined in Gucy2c(-/-)Akt1(-/-) mice . RESULTS The size and number of intestinal crypts increased in Gucy2c(-/-) mice ; the associated epithelial cells showed accelerated proliferation , increased glycolysis , and reduced oxidative phosphorylation , which was reversed by oral administration of cGMP . Conversely , activating guanylyl cyclase C in human colon cancer cells delayed cell-cycle progression , decreased DNA synthesis and colony formation , reduced glycolysis , and increased mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production . AKT signaling pathways were activated in intestines of Gucy2c(-/-) mice , associated with increased AKT phosphorylation . Disruption of AKT activity , pharmacologically or genetically , reduced DNA synthesis , proliferation , and glycolysis , and increased mitochondrial biogenesis . Intestinal tumorigenesis increased after administration of azoxymethane to Gucy2c(-/-) mice , compared with wild-type mice , but was eliminated in Gucy2c(-/-)Akt1(-/-) mice . CONCLUSIONS GUCY2C is a tumor suppressor that controls proliferation and metabolism of intestinal epithelial cells by inactivating AKT signaling . This receptor and its ligands , which are paracrine hormones , might be novel candidates for anticolorectal cancer therapy .
Inflammatory response plays an important role not only in the normal physiology but also in the pathology such as cancers . As chronic inflammations are associated with malignancies , it is important to prevent inflammation-mediated neoplastic formation , promotion and/or progression . One possible intervention will be using cancer chemopreventive agents such as curcumin ( CUR ) , a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress compound . Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) such as docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) or eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) are potent anti-inflammatory agents by decreasing the production of inflammatory eicosanoids , cytokines , and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . The present study aims at examining whether CUR with DHA or EPA would have synergistic anti-inflammatory effects in RAW 264.7 cells . Non-toxic concentrations of single and combination of the compounds were investigated at 6 , 12 and 24h . The nitric oxide ( NO ) suppression effects were most prominent at 24h . All the combinations of CUR and DHA or EPA with lower concentrations of CUR 5 microM and 25 microM of DHA or EPA were found to have synergistic effects in suppressing LPS-stimulated NO and endogenous NO levels . Importantly , very low doses of CUR 2.5 microM and DHA or EPA of 0.78 microM could synergistically suppress the LPS-induced prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) . The combinations were also found to suppress iNOS , COX-2 , 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LOX ) and cPLA(2) but induce HO-1 . Taken together , the present study clearly shows the synergistic anti-inflammatory as well as anti-oxidative stress effects of CUR and PUFA .
Earlier studies indicated that density-arrested cancer cells released an unidentified growth inhibitor whose secretion was prevented by overexpression of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D ( cath D ) . In this study , this growth inhibitor was purified by affinity chromatography and identified as the heat shock cognate 70 protein ( hsc70 ) based on its peptide microsequencing and specific antibody recognition . Among intracellular proteins , including other heat shock proteins , only constitutive hsc70 was secreted in response to the high-cell density . Moreover , hsc70 secretion from cancer cells was generated by serum deprivation , whereas its cellular concentration did not change . Prevention of Hsc70 secretion by cath D overexpression was associated with the formation of multilayer cell cultures , thus indicating a loss of contact inhibition . In addition , we showed that supplementing the culture medium with purified hsc70 inhibited cell proliferation in the nanomolar range . Conversely , removal of this extracellular hsc70 from the medium by either retention on ADP-agarose or competition at the Hsc70 binding site restored cell proliferation . Hsc70 appears active in human breast cancer cells and hypersecreted by direct cath D inhibition . These results suggest a new role of this secreted hsc70 chaperone in cell proliferation that might account for the higher tumor growth of cancer cells overexpressing cath D .
Gliomas are aggressive and almost incurable glial brain tumors which frequently display abnormal platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) signaling . Evidence gained from studies on several in vivo animal models has firmly established a causal connection between aberrant PDGF signaling and the formation of some gliomas . However , only recently has significant knowledge been gained regarding crucial issues such as the glioma cell of origin and the relationship between the transforming stimulus and the cellular characteristics of the resulting tumor . Based on recent evidence , we propose that PDGF can bias cell-fate decisions , driving the acquisition of cell type-specific features by the progeny of multipotent neural progenitors , thus determining the shape and direction of the transformation path . Furthermore , recent data about the cellular mechanisms of PDGF-driven glioma progression and maintenance indicate that PDGF may be required , unexpectedly , to override cell contact inhibition and promote glioma cell infiltration rather than to stimulate cell proliferation .
Polyphenols are widely distributed in plants and known for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties . Areca nut , rich in polyphenols , is the major component of betel quid and we have previously shown that the extract of areca nut can induce oxidative stress in vitro . In this study , we have further pinpointed that areca nut extract ( ANE ) contains catechin based procyanidins which range from dimers to decamers and polymers ; this was carried out by HPLC and electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry ( ESI/MS ) . To quantify their antioxidant potential , oligomeric and polymeric procyanidins of ANE were separated and evaluated using the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity ( TEAC ) assay . The results clearly demonstrated that the antioxidant capacity of the ANE procyanidins increased with the degree of polymerization . The anti-inflammatory potential of ANE was also tested using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-treated human oral cancer SAS cells . ANE inhibited TPA-induced cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) protein expression at low doses , which correlated with the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in the SAS cells . Furthermore , feeding rats with ANE at 1 and 10mg/kg/day for 5days significantly repressed carrageenan-induced inflammatory exudates and PGE(2) formation . In conclusion , ANE , which contains catechins based oligomeric and polymeric procyanidins , regulates COX-2 expression in vitro and possess anti-inflammatory potential in vivo .
Tumor endothelial marker ( TEM ) 5 is an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor upregulated in endothelial cells during tumor and physiologic angiogenesis . So far , the mechanisms leading to upregulation of TEM5 and its function during angiogenesis have not been identified . Here , we report that TEM5 expression in endothelial cells is induced during capillary-like network formation on Matrigel , during capillary morphogenesis in a three-dimensional collagen I matrix , and upon confluence on a two-dimensional matrix . TEM5 expression was not induced by a variety of soluble angiogenic factors , including VEGF and bFGF , in subconfluent endothelial cells . TEM5 upregulation was blocked by toxin B from Clostridium difficile , an inhibitor of the small GTPases Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 . The Rho inhibitor C3 transferase from Clostridium botulinum did not affect TEM5 expression , whereas the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 suppressed TEM5 upregulation . An excess of the soluble TEM5 extracellular domain or an inhibitory monoclonal TEM5 antibody blocked contact inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation resulting in multilayered islands within the endothelial monolayer and increased vessel density during capillary formation . Based on our results we conclude that TEM5 expression during capillary morphogenesis is induced by the small GTPase Rac and mediates contact inhibition of proliferation in endothelial cells .
Chromated copper arsenate , which is used worldwide as a wood preservative , can adversely affect human health . Accumulating evidence suggests that chromium ( Cr ) and arsenic ( As ) can potentially disrupt the redox balance and cause respiratory diseases and cancer in humans . The present study was designed to determine the combined toxic effects of these metals in the lungs and to clarify the specific molecules that are stimulated by combined exposure to both metals . Male C57BL/6J mice were intratracheally instilled with arsenate [ As(V) ] , hexavalent chromium [ Cr(VI) ] , or a combination of both metals . Mice were sacrificed 2 days after treatment to collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue samples . Inflammation , cytotoxicity , apoptosis , and oxidative stress markers were measured . Our results indicated that administration of Cr(VI) alone or in combination with As(V) induced neutrophil-dominant inflammation as well as phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases ; effects of treatment with As(V) alone were comparatively less potent . By analyzing the production of interleukin-6 and activity of lactate dehydrogenase and caspase , we confirmed that co-treatment intensified pulmonary injury and that it was accompanied by oxidative stress , as confirmed by marked increases in the production of reactive oxygen species , reduced glutathione content , and thioredoxin reductase ( TRXRD ) activity . Expressed mRNA levels of heme oxygenase-1 , glutamylcysteine ligase , glutathione peroxidase 2 , thioredoxin ( TRX ) 1 , and TRXRD1 were also enhanced by co-treatment , whereas treatment with As(V) alone reduced the mRNA expression level of TRX2 . Our data suggest that co-treatment with As(V) exacerbated Cr(VI)-induced pulmonary injury and that this effect may be exerted through a disruption in the balance among several antioxidant genes .
The aim of the present study was to evaluate immunomodulator ginsan , a polysaccharide extracted from Panax ginseng , on carbon tetrachloride ( CCl(4))-induced liver injury . BALB/c mice were injected i.p. with ginsan 24 h prior to CCl(4) administration . Serum liver enzyme levels , histology , expression of antioxidant enzymes , and several cytokines/chemokines were subsequently evaluated . Ginsan treatment markedly suppressed the serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) levels , and hepatic histological necrosis increased by CCl(4) treatment . Ginsan inhibited CCl(4) induced lipid peroxidation through the cytochrome P450 2E1 ( CYP2E1 ) downregulation . The hepatoprotective effect of ginsan was attributed to induction of anti-oxidant protein contents , such as superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase , and glutathione peroxidase ( GPX ) as well as restoration of the hepatic glutathione ( GSH ) concentration . The marked increase of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-1beta , IFN-gamma ) and chemokines ( MCP-1 , MIP-2beta , KC ) in CCl(4) treated mice was additionally attenuated by ginsan , thereby preventing leukocyte infiltration and local inflammation . Our results suggest that ginsan effectively prevent liver injury , mainly through downregulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory response .
UNLABELLED ABC transporters like P-glycoprotein ( P-gp/ABCB1 ) are membrane proteins responsible for the transport of toxic compounds out of non-malignant cells and tumor tissue . AIM To investigate the effect of glycolysis and the tissue redox state on P-gp expression in multicellular tumor spheroids derived from prostate adenocarcinoma cells ( DU-145 ) , glioma cells ( Gli36 ) , and the human cervix carcinoma cell line KB-3-1 transfected with a P-gp-EGFP fusion gene that allows monitoring of P-gp expression in living cells . During cell culture of DU-145 , Gli36 , and KB-3-1 tumor spheroids P-gp expression was observed as well as increased lactate and decreased pyruvate levels and expression of glycolytic enzymes . Inhibition of glycolysis for 24 h by either iodoacetate ( IA ) or 2-deoxy-D-glucose ( 2-DDG ) downregulated P-gp expression which was reversed upon coincubation with the radical scavenger ebselen as shown by semi-quantitative immunohistochemisty in DU-145 and Gli36 tumor spheroids , and by EGFP fluorescence in KB-3-1 tumor spheroids . Consequently endogenous ROS generation in DU-145 tumor spheroids was increased in the presence of either IA or 2-DDG , which was abolished upon coincubation with ebselen . Exogenous addition of pyruvate significantly reduced ROS generation , increased P-gp expression as well as efflux of the P-gp substrate doxorubicin . Doxorubicin transport was significantly blunted by 2-DDG and IA , indicating that inhibition of glycolysis reversed the multidrug resistance phenotype . In summary our data demonstrate that P-gp expression in tumor spheroids is closely related to the glycolytic metabolism of tumor cells and can be downregulated by glycolysis inhibitors via mechanisms that involve changes in the cellular redox state .
Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) such as hydrogen peroxide ( H(2)O(2) ) , O(*-)(2) and OH(*) participate in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion injury , inflammation and atherosclerosis . Our previous studies have suggested that increased angiotensin II ( Ang II)-forming chymase may be involved in the development of atherosclerosis . However , the regulatory mechanism of chymase expression has not yet been clarified . In this study , we tested whether oxidative stress upregulates mouse mast cell proteinase chymase , mouse mast cell proteinase ( MMCP)-5 or MMCP-4 . We also examined the expression and activity of these proteins after treatment . Cultured mouse mastocytoma cells ( MMC ) displaying chymase-dependent Ang II-forming activity were treated with H(2)O(2) and several aminothiols with or without anti-oxidants . The levels of MMCP-5 and MMCP-4 expression were determined by quantitative RT-PCR ; the level of chymase-dependent Ang II-forming activity was measured by high performance liquid chromatography using Ang I as a substrate . Treatment of MMC with homocysteine ( 0.1-3 mmol l(-1) ) significantly increased MMCP-5 and MMCP-4 expression , as well as Ang II-forming activity . These effects were significantly inhibited by the addition of catalase and further suppressed by the combination of catalase and superoxide dismutase . Incubation with hydrogen peroxide alone caused a significant increase in Ang II-forming activity , which was completely suppressed by co-treatment with catalase . Furthermore , MMCP-5 and MMCP-4 expression levels were drastically suppressed and chymase induction by homocysteine was diminished under the GATA-inhibited condition . Homocysteine increased mast cell chymase expression and activity through the mechanism of oxidative stress . Our results suggest that there is a biochemical link between oxidative stress and the local Ang II-forming system .
Depleted uranium ( DU ) is commonly used in military armor and munitions , and thus , exposure of soldiers and noncombatants is frequent and widespread . Previous studies have shown that DU has both chemical and radiological toxicity and that the primary route of exposure of DU to humans is through inhalation and ingestion . However , there is limited research information on the potential carcinogenicity of DU in human bronchial cells . Accordingly , we determined the neoplastic transforming ability of particulate DU to human bronchial epithelial cells ( BEP2D ) . We observed the loss of contact inhibition and anchorage independent growth in cells exposed to DU after 24 h . We also characterized these DU-induced transformed cell lines and found that 40% of the cell lines exhibit alterations in plating efficiency and no significant changes in the cytotoxic response to DU . Cytogenetic analyses showed that 53% of the DU-transformed cell lines possess a hypodiploid phenotype . These data indicate that human bronchial cells are transformed by DU and exhibit significant chromosome instability consistent with a neoplastic phenotype .
Odontogenic tumors originate from the remains of migrating enamel epithelium after the completion of normal tooth genesis . These enamel epithelium remnants exhibit the ability to recapitulate the events that occur during tooth formation . Several lines of evidence suggest that aberrance in the signaling pathways similar to the ones that are used during tooth development , including the WNT pathway , might be the cause of odontogenic tumorigenesis and maintenance . In this study we demonstrated that WNT5A expression was intense in both the epithelial component of ameloblastomas , the most common epithelial odontogenic tumor , and in this tumor's likely precursor cell , the enamel epithelium located at the cervical loop of normal developing human tooth buds . Additionally , when WNT5A was overexpressed in enamel epithelium cells ( LS-8 ) , the clones expressing high levels of WNT5A ( S ) exhibited characteristics of tumorigenic cells , including growth factor independence , loss of anchorage dependence , loss of contact inhibition , and tumor formation in immunocompromised mice . Moreover , overexpression of WNT5A drastically increased LS-8 cell migration and actin reorganization when compared with controls . Suppression of endogenous WNT5A in LS-8 cells ( AS ) greatly impaired their migration and AS cells failed to form significant actin reorganization and membrane protrusion was rarely seen . Taken together , our data indicate that WNT5A signaling is important in modulating tumorigenic behaviors of enamel epithelium cells in ameloblastomas .
The high glucose consumption of tumor cells even in an oxygen-rich environment , referred to as the Warburg effect , has been noted as a nearly universal biochemical characteristic of cancer cells . Targeting the glycolysis pathway has been explored as an anti-cancer therapeutic strategy to eradicate cancer based on this fundamental biochemical property of cancer cells . Oncoproteins such as Akt and c-Myc regulate cell metabolism . Accumulating studies have uncovered various molecular mechanisms by which oncoproteins affect cellular metabolism , raising a concern as to whether targeting glycolysis will be equally effective in treating cancers arising from different oncogenic activities . Here , we established a dual-regulatable FL5.12 pre-B cell line in which myristoylated Akt is expressed under the control of doxycycline , and c-Myc , fused to the hormone-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor , is activated by 4-hydroxytamoxifen . Using this system , we directly compared the effect of these oncoproteins on cell metabolism in an isogenic background . Activation of either Akt or c-Myc leads to the Warburg effect as indicated by increased cellular glucose uptake , glycolysis , and lactate generation . When cells are treated with glycolysis inhibitors , Akt sensitizes cells to apoptosis , whereas c-Myc does not . In contrast , c-Myc but not Akt sensitizes cells to the inhibition of mitochondrial function . This is correlated with enhanced mitochondrial activities in c-Myc cells . Hence , although both Akt and c-Myc promote aerobic glycolysis , they differentially affect mitochondrial functions and render cells susceptible to the perturbation of cellular metabolic programs .
High concentrations of lactic acid ( LA ) are found under various pathophysiological conditions and are accompanied by an acidification of the environment . To study the impact of LA on TNF secretion , human LPS-stimulated monocytes were cultured with or without LA or the corresponding pH control . TNF secretion was significantly suppressed by low concentrations of LA ( < or = 10 mM ) , whereas only strong acidification had a similar effect . This result was confirmed in a coculture model of human monocytes with multicellular tumor spheroids . Blocking synthesis of tumor-derived lactate by oxamic acid , an inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase , reversed the suppression of TNF secretion in this coculture model . We then investigated possible mechanisms underlying the suppression . Uptake of [ 3-(13)C]lactate by monocytes was shown by hyphenated mass spectrometry . As lactate might interfere with glycolysis , the glycolytic flux of monocytes was determined . We added [ 1,2-(13)C(2)]glucose to the culture medium and measured glucose uptake and conversion into [ 2,3-(13)C(2)]lactate . Activation of monocytes increased the glycolytic flux and the secretion of lactate , whereas oxygen consumption was decreased . Addition of unlabeled LA resulted in a highly significant decrease in [ 2,3-(13)C(2)]lactate secretion , whereas a mere corresponding decrease in pH exerted a less pronounced effect . Both treatments increased intracellular [ 2,3-(13)C(2)]lactate levels . Blocking of glycolysis by 2-deoxyglucose strongly inhibited TNF secretion , whereas suppression of oxidative phosphorylation by rotenone had little effect . These results support the hypothesis that TNF secretion by human monocytes depends on glycolysis and suggest that LA and acidification may be involved in the suppression of TNF secretion in the tumor environment .
Mutations in the tumor suppressor tuberin ( TSC2 ) are a common factor in the development of lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) . LAM is a cystic lung disease that is characterized by the infiltration of smooth muscle-like cells into the pulmonary parenchyma . The mechanism by which the loss of tuberin promotes the development of LAM has yet to be elucidated , although several lines of evidence suggest it is due to the metastasis of tuberin-deficient cells . Here we show that tuberin-null cells become nonadherent and invasive . These nonadherent cells express cleaved forms of beta-catenin . In reporter assays , the beta-catenin products are transcriptionally active and promote MMP7 expression . Invasion by the tuberin-null cells is mediated by MMP7 . Examination of LAM tissues shows the expression of cleaved beta-catenin products and MMP7 consistent with a model that tuberin-deficient cells acquire invasive properties through a beta-catenin-dependent mechanism , which may underlie the development of LAM .
Histone H3 methylation at lysine 4 ( K4 ) is associated with euchromatic regions and is thought to be important for the transcriptional activation of genes during differentiation . In this study , we found that di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 at K4 and acetylation of histones H3 and H4 from the promoter/enhancer to the transcribed region close to the transcription initiation site of the solute carrier family 2 , member 5 ( SLC2A5 ) gene , and its expression , were induced by differentiation of intestine-like Caco-2 cells . These effects were accompanied by contact inhibition of cell growth of these cells . Furthermore , these modifications were induced by co-treatment with a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone and a p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD89059 . Our results suggest that methylation of histone H3 at K4 and acetylation of histones H3 and H4 are involved in SLC2A5 gene induction associated with intestinal differentiation of Caco-2 cells .
BACKGROUND AND AIMS Hepatitis C virus ( HCV)-induced chronic inflammation may induce oxidative stress which could compromise the repair of damaged DNA , rendering cells more susceptible to spontaneous or mutagen-induced alterations , the underlying cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma . In the current study we examined the induction of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) resulting from HCV infection and evaluated its effect on the host DNA damage and repair machinery . METHODS HCV infected human hepatoma cells were analyzed to determine ( i ) ROS , ( ii ) 8-oxoG and ( iii ) DNA glycosylases NEIL1 , NEIL2 , OGG1 . Liver biopsies were analyzed for NEIL1 . RESULTS Human hepatoma cells infected with HCV JFH-1 showed 30-60-fold increases in ROS levels compared to uninfected cells . Levels of the oxidatively modified guanosine base 8-oxoguanine ( 8-oxoG ) were significantly increased sixfold in the HCV-infected cells . Because DNA glycosylases are the enzymes that remove oxidized nucleotides , their expression in HCV-infected cells was analyzed . NEIL1 but not OGG1 or NEIL2 gene expression was impaired in HCV-infected cells . In accordance , we found reduced glycosylase ( NEIL1-specific ) activity in HCV-infected cells . The antioxidant N-acetyl cystein ( NAC ) efficiently reversed the NEIL1 repression by inhibiting ROS induction by HCV . NEIL1 expression was also partly restored when virus-infected cells were treated with interferon ( IFN ) . HCV core and to a lesser extent NS3-4a and NS5A induced ROS , and downregulated NEIL1 expression . Liver biopsy specimens showed significant impairment of NEIL1 levels in HCV-infected patients with advanced liver disease compared to patients with no disease . CONCLUSION Collectively , the data indicate that HCV induction of ROS and perturbation of NEIL1 expression may be mechanistically involved in progression of liver disease and suggest that antioxidant and antiviral therapies can reverse these deleterious effects of HCV in part by restoring function of the DNA repair enzyme/s .
Cell proliferation is known to be accompanied by activation of glycolysis . We have recently discovered that the glycolysis-promoting enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase , isoform 3 ( PFKFB3 ) , is degraded by the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C-Cdh1 , which also degrades cell-cycle proteins . We now show in two different cell types ( neoplastic and nonneoplastic ) that both proliferation and aerobic glycolysis are prevented by overexpression of Cdh1 and enhanced by its silencing . Furthermore , we have coexpressed Cdh1 with PFKFB3--either wild-type or a mutant form resistant to ubiquitylation by APC/C-Cdh1--or with the glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase and demonstrated that whereas glycolysis is essential for cell proliferation , its initiation in the presence of active Cdh1 does not result in proliferation . Our experiments indicate that the proliferative response , regardless of whether it occurs in normal or neoplastic cells , is dependent on a decrease in the activity of APC/C-Cdh1 , which activates both proliferation and glycolysis . These observations have implications for cell proliferation , neoplastic transformation , and the prevention and treatment of cancer .
The contribution that mitochondrial bioenergetics could have in cancer development is debated . Here , we have generated HCT116-derived colocarcinoma cell lines expressing different levels of the beta catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial H+-adenosine triphosphate synthase to assess the contribution of mitochondrial bioenergetics in colon cancer progression . The generated cells exhibit large ultrastructural , transcriptomic , proteomic and functional differences in their mitochondria and in their in vivo tumor forming capacity . We show that the activity of oxidative phosphorylation defines the rate of glucose utilization by aerobic glycolysis . The aggressive cellular phenotype , which is highly glycolytic , is bound to the deregulated expression of genes involved in metabolic processes , the regulation of the cell cycle , apoptosis , angiogenesis and cell adhesion . Remarkably , the molecular and ultrastructural analysis of the tumors derived from the three HCT116 cell lines under study highlight that tumor promotion inevitably requires the selection of cancer cells with a repressed biogenesis and functional activity of mitochondria , i.e. the highly glycolytic phenotype is selected for tumor development . The tumor forming potential of the cells is a non-genetically acquired condition that provides the cancer cell with a cell-death resistant phenotype . An abrogated mitochondrial respiration contributes to a diminished potential for reactive oxygen species signaling in response to 5-fluorouracil treatment . Treatment of cancer cells with dichloroacetate partially restores the functional differentiation of mitochondria and promotes tumor regression , emphasizing the reversible nature of the metabolic trait of cancer .
The purpose of this study was to combine a three-dimensional NMR-compatible bioreactor with hyperpolarized ( 13)C NMR spectroscopy in order to probe cellular metabolism in real time . JM1 ( immortalized rat hepatoma ) cells were cultured in a three-dimensional NMR-compatible fluidized bioreactor . ( 31)P spectra were acquired before and after each injection of hyperpolarized [ 1-(13)C ] pyruvate and subsequent ( 13)C spectroscopy at 11.7 T . ( 1)H and two-dimensional ( 1)H-(1)H-total correlation spectroscopy spectra were acquired from extracts of cells grown in uniformly labeled ( 13)C-glucose , on a 16.4 T , to determine ( 13)C fractional enrichment and distribution of ( 13)C label . JM1 cells were found to have a high rate of aerobic glycolysis in both two-dimensional culture and in the bioreactor , with 85% of the ( 13)C label from uniformly labeled ( 13)C-glucose being present as either lactate or alanine after 23 h . Flux measurements of pyruvate through lactate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase in the bioreactor system were 12.18 +/- 0.49 nmols/sec/10(8) cells and 2.39 +/- 0.30 nmols/sec/10(8) cells , respectively , were reproducible in the same bioreactor , and were not significantly different over the course of 2 days . Although this preliminary study involved immortalized cells , this combination of technologies can be extended to the real-time metabolic exploration of primary benign and cancerous cells and tissues prior to and after therapy .
p32/gC1qR/C1QBP/HABP1 is a mitochondrial/cell surface protein overexpressed in certain cancer cells . Here we show that knocking down p32 expression in human cancer cells strongly shifts their metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) to glycolysis . The p32 knockdown cells exhibited reduced synthesis of the mitochondrial-DNA-encoded OXPHOS polypeptides and were less tumorigenic in vivo . Expression of exogenous p32 in the knockdown cells restored the wild-type cellular phenotype and tumorigenicity . Increased glucose consumption and lactate production , known as the Warburg effect , are almost universal hallmarks of solid tumors and are thought to favor tumor growth . However , here we show that a protein regularly overexpressed in some cancers is capable of promoting OXPHOS . Our results indicate that high levels of glycolysis , in the absence of adequate OXPHOS , may not be as beneficial for tumor growth as generally thought and suggest that tumor cells use p32 to regulate the balance between OXPHOS and glycolysis .
PURPOSE This study aims to investigate the role of the aberrant expression of Transkelolase-like 1 ( TKTL1 ) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) tumorigenesis and to characterize TKTL1 contribution to HNSCC tumorigenesis through aerobic glycolysis and HIF1alpha stabilization . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN TKTL1 promoter hypomethylation and mRNA/protein aberrant expression were studied in human HNSCC tumor samples and normal mucosas . Oncogenic functions of TKTL1 were examined in HNSCC cell line panels and tumor xenograft models with TKTL1 expression construct . The metabolite levels of fructose-6-phosphate , glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate , pyruvate , lactate , and the levels of HIF1alpha protein and its downsteam glycolytic targets were compared between the TKTL1-expressing and vehicle-expressing HNSCC cells . Meanwhile , the effects of HIF1alpha/glycolytic inhibitors were evaluated on the TKTL1 transfectants . RESULTS TKTL1 exhibits high frequency of promoter hypomethylation in HNSCC tumors compared with the normal mucosas , correlating with its overexpression in HNSCC . Overexpression of TKTL1 in HNSCC cells promoted cellular proliferation and enhanced tumor growth in vitro and in vivo . Overexpression of TKTL1 increased the production of fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate , in turn elevating the production of pyruvate and lactate , resulting in the normoxic stabilization of the malignancy-promoting transcription factor HIF1alpha and the upregulation of downstream glycolytic enzymes . Notably , the reduction of TKTL1 expression decreased HIF1alpha accumulation and inhibition with HIF1alpha and/or the glycolysis inhibitor could abrogate the growth effects mediated by TKTL1 overexpression . CONCLUSION TKTL1 is a novel candidate oncogene that is epigenetically activated by aberrant hypomethlation and contributes to a malignant phenotype through altered glycolytic metabolism and HIF1alpha accumulation .
Topoisomerase inhibitors such as camptothecin and etoposide are used as anti-cancer drugs and induce double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) in genomic DNA in cycling cells . These DSBs are often covalently bound with polypeptides at the 3 ' and 5 ' ends . Such modifications must be eliminated before DSB repair can take place , but it remains elusive which nucleases are involved in this process . Previous studies show that CtIP plays a critical role in the generation of 3 ' single-strand overhang at " clean " DSBs , thus initiating homologous recombination ( HR)-dependent DSB repair . To analyze the function of CtIP in detail , we conditionally disrupted the CtIP gene in the chicken DT40 cell line . We found that CtIP is essential for cellular proliferation as well as for the formation of 3 ' single-strand overhang , similar to what is observed in DT40 cells deficient in the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex . We also generated DT40 cell line harboring CtIP with an alanine substitution at residue Ser332 , which is required for interaction with BRCA1 . Although the resulting CtIP(S332A/-/-) cells exhibited accumulation of RPA and Rad51 upon DNA damage , and were proficient in HR , they showed a marked hypersensitivity to camptothecin and etoposide in comparison with CtIP(+/-/-) cells . Finally , CtIP(S332A/-/-)BRCA1(-/-) and CtIP(+/-/-)BRCA1(-/-) showed similar sensitivities to these reagents . Taken together , our data indicate that , in addition to its function in HR , CtIP plays a role in cellular tolerance to topoisomerase inhibitors . We propose that the BRCA1-CtIP complex plays a role in the nuclease-mediated elimination of oligonucleotides covalently bound to polypeptides from DSBs , thereby facilitating subsequent DSB repair .
Cancer cells constantly adapt to oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) suppression resulting from hypoxia or mitochondria defects . Under the OXPHOS suppression , AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) regulates global metabolism adjustments , but its activation has been found to be transient . Whether cells can maintain cellular ATP homeostasis and survive beyond the transient AMPK activation is not known . Here , we study the bioenergetic adaptation to the OXPHOS inhibitor oligomycin in a group of cancer cells . We found that oligomycin at 100 ng/ml completely inhibits OXPHOS activity in 1 h and induces various levels of glycolysis gains by 6 h , from which we calculate the bioenergetic organizations of cancer cells . In glycolysis-dominant cells , oligomycin does not induce much energy stress as measured by glycolysis acceleration , ATP imbalance , AMPK activation , AMPK substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation at Ser(79) , and cell growth inhibition . In OXPHOS-dependent LKB1 wild type cells , oligomycin induces 5-8% ATP drops and transient AMPK activation during the initial 1-2 h . After AMPK activation is completed , oligomycin-induced increase of acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation at Ser(79) is still detected , and cellular ATP is back at preoligomycin treatment levels by sustained elevation of glycolysis . Cell growth , however , is inhibited without an increase in cell death and alteration in cell cycle distribution . In OXPHOS-dependent LKB1-null cells , no AMPK activation by oligomycin is detected , yet cells still show a similar adaptation . We also demonstrate that the adaptation to oligomycin does not invoke activation of hypoxia-induced factor . Our data suggest that cancer cells may grow and survive persistent OXPHOS suppression through an as yet unidentified regulatory mechanism .
It is commonly believed that neurons remain in G(0) phase of the cell cycle indefinitely . Cell-cycle re-entry , however , is known to contribute to neuronal apoptosis . Moreover , recent evidence demonstrates the expression of cell-cycle proteins in differentiated neurons under physiological conditions . The functional roles of such expression remain unclear . Since DNA repair is generally attenuated by differentiation in most cell types , the cell-cycle-associated events in postmitotic cells may reflect the need to re-enter the cell cycle to activate DNA repair . We show that cyclin-C-directed , pRb-dependent G(0) exit activates the non-homologous end joining pathway of DNA repair ( NHEJ ) in postmitotic neurons . Using RNA interference , we found that abrogation of cyclin-C-mediated exit from G(0) compromised DNA repair but did not initiate apoptosis . Forced G(1) entry combined with prevention of G(1) --> S progression triggered NHEJ activation even in the absence of DNA lesions , but did not induce apoptosis in contrast to unrestricted progression through G(1) --> S. We conclude that G(0) --> G(1) transition is functionally significant for NHEJ repair in postmitotic neurons . These findings reveal the importance of cell-cycle activation for controlling both DNA repair and apoptosis in postmitotic neurons , and underline the particular role of G(1) --> S progression in apoptotic signaling , providing new insights into the mechanisms of DNA damage response ( DDR ) in postmitotic neurons .
Mucoepidermoid carcinoma ( MEC ) , the most common primary salivary malignancy , shows great variability in clinical behaviour , thus demanding investigation to identify of prognostic markers . Since Warburg's studies , unrestricted cell growth during tumorigenesis has been linked to altered metabolism , implying hypoxic stimulation of glycolysis and diminished contribution of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to cellular ATP supply . Hypothesizing that the study of MEC metabolic status could lead to the discovery of prognostic markers , we investigated by immunohistochemistry the expression of glucose transporter 1 ( Glut-1 ) , mitochondrial antigen and peroxiredoxin I ( Prx I ) in samples of MEC from different histological grades . Our results showed that mitochondrial antigen and Prx I were expressed in the majority of the MEC cases independent of the histological grade . In contrast Glut-1 expression increased significantly as the tumours became more aggressive . These results suggested that oxidative phosphorylation may contribute to ATP supply in all stages of MEC progression , and that the relative contribution of glycolysis over mitochondria for cellular ATP supply increases during MEC progression , favouring growth under low oxygen concentration . In addition , the observed high Prx I protein levels could provide protection to tumour cells against reactive oxygen species generated as a consequence of mitochondrial function and hypoxia-reoxygenation cycling . Altogether our findings suggest that upregulation of Glut-1 and Prx I constitute successful adaptive strategies of MEC cells conferring a growth advantage over normal salivary gland cells in the unstable oxygenation tumour environment .
In response to DNA double strand breaks , the histone variant H2AX at the break site is phosphorylated at serine 139 by DNA damage sensor kinases such as ataxia telangiectasia-mutated , forming gamma-H2AX . This phosphorylation event is critical for sustained recruitment of other proteins to repair the break . After repair , restoration of the cell to a prestress state is associated with gamma-H2AX dephosphorylation and dissolution of gamma-H2AX-associated damage foci . The phosphatases PP2A and PP4 have previously been shown to dephosphorylate gamma-H2AX . Here , we demonstrate that the wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 ( WIP1 ) also dephosphorylates gamma-H2AX at serine 139 in vitro and in vivo . Overexpression of WIP1 reduces formation of gamma-H2AX foci in response to ionizing and ultraviolet radiation and blocks recruitment of MDC1 ( mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 ) and 53BP1 ( p53 binding protein 1 ) to DNA damage foci . Finally , these inhibitory effects of WIP1 on gamma-H2AX are accompanied by WIP1 suppression of DNA double strand break repair . Thus , WIP1 has a homeostatic role in reversing the effects of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated phosphorylation of H2AX .
The anti-apoptotic protein , BAX inhibitor-1 ( BI-1 ) , has a role in cancer/tumor progression . BI-1-overexpressing HT1080 and B16F10 cells produced higher lung weights and tumor volumes after injection into the tail veins of mice . Transfection of BI-1 siRNA into cells before injection blocked lung metastasis. in vitro , the overexpression of BI-1 increased cell mobility and invasiveness , with highly increased glucose consumption and cytosolic accumulation of lactate and pyruvate , but decreased mitochondrial O(2) consumption and ATP production . Glucose metabolism-associated extracellular pH also decreased as cells excreted more H(+) , and sodium hydrogen exchanger ( NHE ) activity increased , probably as a homeostatic mechanism for intracellular pH . These alterations activated MMP 2/9 and cell mobility and invasiveness , which were reversed by the NHE inhibitor , 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride ( EIPA ) , suggesting a role for NHE in cancer metastasis . In both in vitro and in vivo experiments , C-terminal deleted ( CDeltaBI-1 ) cells showed similar results to control cells , suggesting that the C-terminal motif is required for BI-1-associated alterations of glucose metabolism , NHE activation and cancer metastasis . These findings strongly suggest that BI-1 reduces extracellular pH and regulates metastasis by altering glucose metabolism and activating NHE , with the C-terminal tail having a pivotal role in these processes .
Diphenyl ditelluride ( DPDT ) is a potential prototype for the development of novel biologically active molecules . Thus , it is important to evaluate the toxic effects of this compound . In the present study , we evaluated the cytotoxic , genotoxic and mutagenic properties of DPDT in Chinese hamster fibroblast ( V79 ) cells , in strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae both proficient and deficient in several DNA repair pathways and in Salmonella typhimurium . DPDT induced frameshift mutations in both S.typhimurium and a haploid wild-type strain of S.cerevisiae . Mutants of S.cerevisiae defective in base excision repair and recombinational repair were more sensitive to DPDT . The results of a lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay suggest that DPDT is cytotoxic to V79 cells . At cytotoxic concentrations , this compound increased thiobarbituric reactive species levels and decreased the glutathione:GSSH ratio in yeast and V79 cells . DPDT generated single- and double-strand DNA breaks in V79 cells , both with and without metabolic activation , as revealed by alkaline and neutral comet assays . Moreover , an induction of oxidative DNA base damage was indicated by a modified comet assay using formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase and endonuclease III . Treatment with DPDT also induced micronucleus formation in V79 cells . Pre-incubation with N-acetylcysteine reduced DPDT's oxidative , genotoxic and mutagenic effects in yeast and V79 cells . Our results suggest that the toxic and mutagenic properties of DPDT may stem from its ability to disturb the redox balance of the cell , which leads to oxidative stress and the induction of DNA damage .
DNA damage checkpoints arrest cell cycle progression to facilitate DNA repair . The ability to survive genotoxic insults depends not only on the initiation of cell cycle checkpoints but also on checkpoint maintenance . While activation of DNA damage checkpoints has been studied extensively , molecular mechanisms involved in sustaining and ultimately inactivating cell cycle checkpoints are largely unknown . Here , we explored feedback mechanisms that control the maintenance and termination of checkpoint function by computationally identifying an evolutionary conserved mitotic phosphorylation network within the DNA damage response . We demonstrate that the non-enzymatic checkpoint adaptor protein 53BP1 is an in vivo target of the cell cycle kinases Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 and Polo-like kinase-1 ( Plk1 ) . We show that Plk1 binds 53BP1 during mitosis and that this interaction is required for proper inactivation of the DNA damage checkpoint. 53BP1 mutants that are unable to bind Plk1 fail to restart the cell cycle after ionizing radiation-mediated cell cycle arrest . Importantly , we show that Plk1 also phosphorylates the 53BP1-binding checkpoint kinase Chk2 to inactivate its FHA domain and inhibit its kinase activity in mammalian cells . Thus , a mitotic kinase-mediated negative feedback loop regulates the ATM-Chk2 branch of the DNA damage signaling network by phosphorylating conserved sites in 53BP1 and Chk2 to inactivate checkpoint signaling and control checkpoint duration .
As the result of genetic alterations and tumor hypoxia , many cancer cells avidly take up glucose and generate lactate through lactate dehydrogenase A ( LDHA ) , which is encoded by a target gene of c-Myc and hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF-1 ) . Previous studies with reduction of LDHA expression indicate that LDHA is involved in tumor initiation , but its role in tumor maintenance and progression has not been established . Furthermore , how reduction of LDHA expression by interference or antisense RNA inhibits tumorigenesis is not well understood . Here , we report that reduction of LDHA by siRNA or its inhibition by a small-molecule inhibitor ( FX11 [ 3-dihydroxy-6-methyl-7-(phenylmethyl)-4-propylnaphthalene-1-carboxylic acid] ) reduced ATP levels and induced significant oxidative stress and cell death that could be partially reversed by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine . Furthermore , we document that FX11 inhibited the progression of sizable human lymphoma and pancreatic cancer xenografts . When used in combination with the NAD(+) synthesis inhibitor FK866 , FX11 induced lymphoma regression . Hence , inhibition of LDHA with FX11 is an achievable and tolerable treatment for LDHA-dependent tumors . Our studies document a therapeutical approach to the Warburg effect and demonstrate that oxidative stress and metabolic phenotyping of cancers are critical aspects of cancer biology to consider for the therapeutical targeting of cancer energy metabolism .
Acidosis commonly observed in solid tumors like pancreatic cancer promotes genetic instability and selection of a more malignant phenotype of cancer cells . Overexpression or activation of integral membrane proteins mediating H+ efflux may contribute to extracellular acidification . Neurotensin ( NT ) induces intracellular alkalinization and stimulates interleukin-8 production in pancreatic cancer cells and , as demonstrated here , the stable NT analog Lys(8)-psi-Lys(9)NT(8-13) enhances the amiloride-sensitive , Na+-dependent transmembrane H+ flux by a factor of 2.05+/-0.28 and 2.69+/-0.07 in BxPC-3 and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells , respectively , by phosphorylation of the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 ( NHE1 ) . Human genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed to detect effects of Lys(8)-psi-Lys(9)NT(8-13) on BxPC-3 cells . Results indicated upregulation of genes involved in regulation of NHE1 , hypoxic response and glycolysis in response to Lys(8)-psi-Lys(9)NT(8-13) even under normoxic conditions . Therefore , our findings suggest that growth factors like NT may be implicated in the early progression of pancreatic cancer by localized acidification and induction of an aerobic glycolytic phenotype with higher metastatic potential in small cell aggregates .
Aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction are common features of aggressive cancer growth . We observed promoter methylation and loss of expression in neurofilament heavy polypeptide ( NEFH ) in a significant proportion of primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) samples that were of a high tumor grade and advanced stage . RNA interference-mediated knockdown of NEFH accelerated ESCC cell growth in culture and increased tumorigenicity in vivo , whereas forced expression of NEFH significantly inhibited cell growth and colony formation . Loss of NEFH caused up-regulation of pyruvate kinase-M2 type and down-regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase , via activation of the Akt/beta-catenin pathway , resulting in enhanced aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction . The acceleration of glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction in NEFH-knockdown cells was suppressed in the absence of beta-catenin expression , and was decreased by the treatment of 2-Deoxyglucose , a glycolytic inhibitor , or API-2 , an Akt inhibitor . Loss of NEFH activates the Akt/beta-catenin pathway and increases glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction . Cancer cells with methylated NEFH can be targeted for destruction with specific inhibitors of deregulated downstream pathways .
BACKGROUND Taxol is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of patients with breast cancer . Despite impressive clinical responses initially , the majority of patients eventually develop resistance to Taxol . Lactate dehydrogenase-A ( LDH-A ) is one of the predominant isoforms of LDH expressed in breast tissue , which controls the conversion of pyruvate to lactate and plays an important role in glucose metabolism . In this study we investigated the role of LDH-A in mediating Taxol resistance in human breast cancer cells . RESULTS Taxol-resistant subclones , derived from the cancer cell line MDA-MB-435 , sustained continuous growth in high concentrations of Taxol while the Taxol-sensitive cells could not . The increased expression and activity of LDH-A were detected in Taxol-resistant cells when compared with their parental cells . The downregulation of LDH-A by siRNA significantly increased the sensitivity of Taxol-resistant cells to Taxol . A higher sensitivity to the specific LDH inhibitor , oxamate , was found in the Taxol-resistant cells . Furthermore , treating cells with the combination of Taxol and oxamate showed a synergistical inhibitory effect on Taxol-resistant breast cancer cells by promoting apoptosis in these cells . CONCLUSION LDH-A plays an important role in Taxol resistance and inhibition of LDH-A re-sensitizes Taxol-resistant cells to Taxol . This supports that Warburg effect is a property of Taxol resistant cancer cells and may play an important role in the development of Taxol resistance . To our knowledge , this is the first report showing that the increased expression of LDH-A plays an important role in Taxol resistance of human breast cancer cells . This study provides valuable information for the future development and use of targeted therapies , such as oxamate , for the treatment of patients with Taxol-resistant breast cancer .
Although the etiology of primary brain tumors is largely unknown , prior studies suggest that DNA repair polymorphisms may influence risk of glioma . Altered DNA repair is also likely to affect the risk of meningioma and acoustic neuroma , but these tumors have not been well studied . We estimated the risk of glioma ( n = 362 ) , meningioma ( n = 134 ) , and acoustic neuroma ( n = 69 ) in non-Hispanic whites with respect to 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 26 genes involved in DNA repair in a hospital-based , case-control study conducted by the National Cancer Institute . We observed significantly increased risk of meningioma with the T variant of GLTSCR1 rs1035938 ( OR(CT/TT) = 3.5 ; 95% confidence interval : 1.8-6.9 ; P(trend) .0006 ) , which persisted after controlling for multiple comparisons ( P = .019 ) . Significantly increased meningioma risk was also observed for the minor allele variants of ERCC4 rs1800067 ( P(trend) .01 ) ; MUTYH rs3219466 ( P(trend) .02 ) , and PCNA rs25406 ( P(trend) .03 ) . The NBN rs1805794 minor allele variant was associated with decreased meningioma risk ( P(trend) .006 ) . Risk of acoustic neuroma was increased for the ERCC2 rs1799793 ( P(trend) .03 ) and ERCC5 rs17655 ( P(trend) .05 ) variants and decreased for the PARP1 rs1136410 ( P(trend) .03 ) . Decreased glioma risk was observed with the XRCC1 rs1799782 variant ( P(trend) .04 ) . Our results suggest that common DNA repair variants may affect the risk of adult brain tumors , especially meningioma .
It is crucial for organ homeostasis that epithelia have effective mechanisms to restrict motility and cell proliferation in order to maintain tissue architecture . On the other hand , epithelial cells need to rapidly and transiently acquire a more mesenchymal phenotype , with high levels of cell motility and proliferation , in order to repair epithelia upon injury . Cross talk between cell-cell and cell-matrix signaling is crucial for regulating these transitions . The Pak1-betaPIX-GIT complex is an effector complex downstream of the small GTPase Rac1 . We previously showed that translocation of this complex from cell-matrix to cell-cell adhesion sites was required for the establishment of contact inhibition of proliferation . In this study , we provide evidence that this translocation depends on cadherin function . Cadherins do not recruit the complex by direct interaction . Rather , we found that inhibition of the normal function of cadherin or Pak1 leads to defects in focal adhesion turnover and to increased signaling by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase . We propose that cadherins are involved in regulation of contact inhibition by controlling the function of the Pak1-betaPIX-GIT complex at focal contacts .
BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC or Lynch syndrome ) , is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that is believed to account for 2-10 per cent of all the colorectal cancer cases . The disease follows autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with high penetrance ( 85% ) and younger age of onset when compared to patients with sporadic tumours . HNPCC is associated with germ-line mutations in the DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) genes namely MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , and PMS2 . The present study was aimed at analyzing mismatch repair gene(s) in an extended Indian family satisfying the Amsterdam criteria , and extending the analysis to general population to estimate frequency of the mutations/polymorphisms observed . METHODS A total 12 members of the HNPCC family were studied for genetic investigation . Ethnically matched 250 normal individuals were also included as controls to study the observed mutations/polymorphisms at population level . RESULTS The analysis resulted in identification of a 1975C>T mutation in exon 17 , resulting in substitution of arginine residue with stop codon at codon 659. 655A>G substitution was also observed , resulting in replacement of isoleucine with valine at codon 219 . Similar analysis on 250 ethnically matched control subjects revealed complete absence of R659X mutation , while I219V variant was found in 9.8 per cent of the controls . INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION R659X mutation correlates with disease phenotype , and 655A>G locus is highly polymorphic . Our study suggested that R659X substitution was prime cause for the disease phenotype in this family . I219V substitution is a polymorphism having no association with the disease onset or segregation . The family members harbouring this mutation were advised to be under regular medical surveillance .
Previous studies with selenium and/or vitamin E in prostate carcinogenesis animal models have been negative , but these models may not involve oxidative stress mechanisms . In this study , we examined the potential of selenomethionine and alpha-tocopherol to modulate prostate cancer development in the testosterone plus estradiol-treated NBL rat , a model that does involve sex hormone-induced oxidative stress mechanisms and prostatic inflammation . One week following the implantation with hormone-filled Silastic implants , rats were fed diets containing l-selenomethionine ( 1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg ) , DL-alpha-tocopherol acetate ( 2,000 or 4,000 mg/kg ) , or a natural ingredient control diet ( NIH-07 ) . The development of prostate carcinomas was not affected by dietary treatment with either agent . Food intake , body weight , and mortality were also not affected . The high dose of selenomethionine reduced the severity of epithelial dysplasia in the lateral prostate that was not associated with inflammation , and alpha-tocopherol reduced in a dose-related fashion the incidence of marked inflammation and marked epithelial dysplasia in the lateral prostate , regardless of whether these lesions were associated with inflammation. alpha-Tocopherol significantly increased the incidence of adenocarcinomas of the mammary glands at both dietary concentrations . Collectively , our findings suggest that selenomethionine and alpha-tocopherol supplementation does not prevent prostate cancer in rats fed diets with nutritionally adequate levels of selenium and vitamin E. Importantly , the results of the current animal studies and those reported previously were fully predictive of the outcome of the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial .
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates a spectrum of toxic and biological effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and related compounds . Several reports have shown that the AhR plays an important role in the control of cell-cycle progression , and this function is thought to be partly associated with the tumor promotion activity of dioxin . However , the underling mechanisms are not fully understood . We have previously shown that overexpression of AhR , as well as AhR ligand treatment , stimulates cell proliferation of human lung cancer A549 cells . In AhR-activated cells , the expression levels of DNA synthesis-related genes such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) and RFC38 are notably increased . Expression of these genes is mainly regulated by E2F1 , a transcription factor that is crucial for transition of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase . We show here that the transcriptional activity of E2F1 is increased by the AhR agonist treatment and that this effect depends on the presence of AhR . Functional mapping of AhR showed that the Per-Arnt-Sim ( PAS ) B domain is required for promotion of E2F1 activity . The mechanism involves formation of a complex of AhR and E2F1 on the regulatory region in the E2F1 target gene , followed by recruitment of coactivator activator for thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors ( ACTR ) . Consequently , the results in this study indicate the physiological function of AhR as a potent transcriptional coactivator of E2F1-dependent transcription and implicate the AhR-E2F1 interaction as a part of the mechanism by which AhR/Arnt promotes cell proliferation .
Cancer cells upregulate glycolysis , increasing glucose uptake to meet energy needs . A small fraction of a cell's glucose enters the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway ( HBP ) , which regulates levels of O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine ( O-GlcNAc ) , a carbohydrate posttranslational modification of diverse nuclear and cytosolic proteins . We discovered that breast cancer cells upregulate the HBP , including increased O-GlcNAcation and elevated expression of O-GlcNAc transferase ( OGT ) , which is the enzyme catalyzing the addition of O-GlcNAc to proteins . Reduction of O-GlcNAcation through RNA interference of OGT in breast cancer cells leads to inhibition of tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo and is associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and increased expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1) . Elevation of p27(Kip1) was associated with decreased expression and activity of the oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1 , a known regulator of p27(Kip1) stability through transcriptional control of Skp2 . Reducing O-GlcNAc levels in breast cancer cells decreased levels of FoxM1 protein and caused a decrease in multiple FoxM1-specific targets , including Skp2 . Moreover , reducing O-GlcNAcation decreased cancer cell invasion and was associated with the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 , a known FoxM1 target . Finally , pharmacological inhibition of OGT in breast cancer cells had similar anti-growth and anti-invasion effects . These findings identify O-GlcNAc as a novel mechanism through which alterations in glucose metabolism regulate cancer growth and invasion and suggest that OGT may represent novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer .
Ataxia telangiectasia ( AT ) cells , with their defective double-strand break ( DSB ) repair processes , exhibit high sensitivity to low-LET radiation such as X-rays irradiation and gamma beams . Since heavy ion beam treatment for cancer is becoming increasingly common in Japan and elsewhere , it is important to also determine their sensitivity to high-LET radiation . For this purpose we irradiated AT and normal human cells immortalized with the human telomerase gene using high- ( 24-60 keV/microm carbon and 200 keV/microm iron ions ) or low-LET ( X-rays ) radiation in non-proliferative conditions . In normal cells the RBE ( relative biological effectiveness ) of carbon and iron ions increased from 1.19 to 1.81 in proportion to LET . In contrast , their RBE in AT cells increased from 1.32 at 24 keV/microm to 1.59 at 40 keV/microm , and exhibited a plateau at over 40 keV/microm . In normal cells most gamma-H2AX foci induced by both carbon- and iron-ion beams had disappeared at 40 h . In AT cells , however , a significant number of gamma-H2AX foci were still observed at 40 h . The RBEs found in the AT cells after heavy-ion irradiation were consistent with the effects predicted from the presence of non-homologous end joining defects . The DSBs remaining after heavy-ion irradiation suggested defects in the AT cells ' DSB repair ability .
BACKGROUND Inactivation of p53 is involved in arsenite-induced tumorigenesis ; however , the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood . OBJECTIVE We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the inactivation of p53 and neoplastic transformation induced by arsenite in human embryo lung fibroblast ( HELF ) cells . METHODS Anchorage-independent growth assays were performed , and tumorigenicity in intact animals was assessed to confirm arsenite-induced neoplastic transformation . We determined the levels and functions of p53 , nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-B ; a key transcriptional regulator ) , and mot-2 ( a p53 inhibitor ) and their relationships in arsenite-induced transformed HELF cells by two-dimensional electrophoresis , reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction , Western blot , immunofluorescence , and co-immunoprecipitation assays . RESULTS Exposure of HELF cells to low levels of arsenite increased their proliferation rate and anchorage-independent growth and disrupted normal contact inhibition . When introduced into nude mice , transformed cells were tumorigenic . We used proteomic analysis to identify proteins with altered expression between untreated and arsenite-exposed cells . We found decreased expression of NF-B repressing factor ( NKRF ; an inhibitor of NF-B-mediated gene transcription ) , increased expression of mot-2 , and increased activation of NF-B . Changes in cells exposed to 1.0 microM arsenite were more marked than changes in cells exposed to 0.5 or 2.0 microM arsenite . Inactivation of NF-B prevented malignant transformation induced by 1.0 microM arsenite . Moreover , we also identified a mechanism whereby NF-B regulated p53 . Specifically , activation of NF-B up-regulated mot-2 expression , which prevented nuclear translocation of p53 and switched the binding preference of the p53 and NF-B coactivator CBP [ cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) binding protein ] from p53 to NF-B . CONCLUSIONS mot-2-mediated cross talk between NF-B and p53 appears to be involved in arsenite-induced tumorigenesis of HELF cells .
Previous epidemiologic observational and experimental studies investigated the potential of antioxidant micronutrients to modulate cancer risk , but these studies produced inconsistent results . In this pilot , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial ( n = 47 ) , we assessed the effects of an antioxidant micronutrient combination ( 800 mg dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate , 24 mg beta-carotene , 1.0 g vitamin C , 200 microg l-selenomethionine , 7.2 mg riboflavin , 80 mg niacin , 60 mg zinc , 5 mg manganese ) given daily over 4 months on oxidative and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with a history of sporadic colorectal adenoma . Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , interleukin-6 , and F2-isoprostane concentrations were measured using ELISAs , and cystine ( CySS ) was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography . Plasma TNF-alpha concentration decreased in the active treatment group by 37% relative to the placebo group ( P = 0.002 ) , and CySS decreased by 19% ( P = 0.03 ) ; however , interleukin-6 and F2-isoprostane concentrations decreased in antioxidant-treated nonsmokers but increased in smokers , although these findings were not statistically significant . The decreases of TNF-alpha and CySS were more pronounced in nonsmokers . These data suggest that ( a ) an antioxidant micronutrient cocktail can modulate biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in humans and ( b ) the effects of antioxidant micronutrient supplementation on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress may differ according to smoking status .
The tumor suppressor p27(Kip1) is an inhibitor of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) complexes and plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation . Nevertheless , p27 function in the tumorigenesis of the uterine cervix has been poorly defined . Some phenomenon hints that HPV E7 protein can enhance p27 expression , which is contradictory to HPV E7's property of increasing cell proliferation rate . So , in the present study , we have examined the effect of E7 on p27 expression . Though the levels of p27 are increased after HPV E7 expression , most of the p27 protein localized in the cytoplasm and have no function on cell cycle arrest and contact inhibition . The cell migration rate is elevated when p27 is high expression and located in cytoplasm . The results indicated that E7-p27 interaction not only abolished the p27's cell cycle inhibitory function by sequestering it to the cytoplasm , but also endow the cell with invasive property which is the feature of malignant cells .
INTRODUCTION Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs with pleiotropic activities including inhibition of isoprenylation and reduction of signals driving cell proliferation and survival responses . METHODS In this study we evaluated the effects of lovastatin acid and lactone on breast cancer MDAMB231 and MDAMB468 cells using a combination of proteomic and metabonomic profiling techniques . RESULTS Lovastatin inhibited proliferation of breast cancer cell lines . MDAMB231 cells were more sensitive to its effects , and in most cases lovastatin acid showed more potency towards the manipulation of protein expression than lovastatin lactone . Increased expression of Rho inhibitor GDI-2 stabilized the non-active Ras homolog gene family member A ( RhoA ) leading to a decreased expression of its active , membrane-bound form . Its downstream targets cofilin , CDC42 and G3BP1 are members of the GTPase family affected by lovastatin . Our data indicated that lovastatin modulated the E2F1-pathway through the regulation of expression of prohibitin and retinoblastoma ( Rb ) . This subsequently leads to changes of E2F-downstream targets minichromosome maintenance protein 7 ( MCM7 ) and MutS homolog 2 ( MSH2 ) . Lovastatin also regulated the AKT-signaling pathway . Increased phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) and decreased DJ-1 expression lead to a down-regulation of the active pAkt . Lovastatin's involvement in the AKT-signaling pathway was confirmed by an upregulation of its downstream target , tumor progressor NDRG1 . Metabolic consequences to lovastatin exposure included suppression of glycolytic and Krebs cycle activity , and lipid biosynthesis . CONCLUSIONS The combination of proteomics and metabonomics enabled us to identify several key targets essential to the antitumor activity of lovastatin . Our results imply that lovastatin has the potential to reduce the growth of breast cancer cells .
INTRODUCTION Various agents used in breast cancer chemotherapy provoke DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) . DSB repair competence determines the sensitivity of cells to these agents whereby aberrations in the repair machinery leads to apoptosis . Proteins required for this pathway can be detected as nuclear foci at sites of DNA damage when the pathway is intact . Here we investigate whether focus formation of repair proteins can predict chemosensitivity of breast cancer . METHODS Core needle biopsy specimens were obtained from sixty cases of primary breast cancer before and 18-24 hours after the first cycle of neoadjuvant epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide ( EC ) treatment . Nuclear focus formation of DNA damage repair proteins was immunohistochemically analyzed and compared with tumor response to chemotherapy . RESULTS EC treatment induced nuclear foci of gammaH2AX , conjugated ubiquitin , and Rad51 in a substantial amount of cases . In contrast , BRCA1 foci were observed before treatment in the majority of the cases and only decreased after EC in thirteen cases . The presence of BRCA1- , gammaH2AX- , or Rad51-foci before treatment or the presence of Rad51-foci after treatment was inversely correlated with tumor response to chemotherapy . DNA damage response ( DDR ) competence was further evaluated by considering all four repair indicators together . A high DDR score significantly correlated with low tumor response to EC and EC + docetaxel whereas other clinicopathological factors analyzed did not . CONCLUSIONS High performing DDR focus formation resulted in tumor resistance to DNA damage-inducing chemotherapy . Our results suggested an importance of evaluation of DDR competence to predict breast cancer chemosensitivity , and merits further studying into its usefulness in exclusion of non-responder patients .
BACKGROUND Astaxanthin modulates immune response , inhibits cancer cell growth , reduces bacterial load and gastric inflammation , and protects against UVA-induced oxidative stress in in vitro and rodent models . Similar clinical studies in humans are unavailable . Our objective is to study the action of dietary astaxanthin in modulating immune response , oxidative status and inflammation in young healthy adult female human subjects . METHODS Participants ( averaged 21.5 yr ) received 0 , 2 , or 8 mg astaxanthin ( n = 14/diet ) daily for 8 wk in a randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Immune response was assessed on wk 0 , 4 and 8 , and tuberculin test performed on wk 8 . RESULTS Plasma astaxanthin increased ( P < 0.01 ) dose-dependently after 4 or 8 wk of supplementation . Astaxanthin decreased a DNA damage biomarker after 4 wk but did not affect lipid peroxidation . Plasma C-reactive protein concentration was lower ( P < 0.05 ) on wk 8 in subjects given 2 mg astaxanthin . Dietary astaxanthin stimulated mitogen-induced lymphoproliferation , increased natural killer cell cytotoxic activity , and increased total T and B cell subpopulations , but did not influence populations of Thelper , Tcytotoxic or natural killer cells . A higher percentage of leukocytes expressed the LFA-1 marker in subjects given 2 mg astaxanthin on wk 8 . Subjects fed 2 mg astaxanthin had a higher tuberculin response than unsupplemented subjects . There was no difference in TNF and IL-2 concentrations , but plasma IFN-gamma and IL-6 increased on wk 8 in subjects given 8 mg astaxanthin . CONCLUSION Therefore , dietary astaxanthin decreases a DNA damage biomarker and acute phase protein , and enhances immune response in young healthy females .
Tumor invasion and metastasis are the primary causes of cancer patient mortality , underscoring the need for identification of novel genes and signaling pathways that mediate these prognosis-determining phenomena . To identify and characterize novel lung adenocarcinoma genes associated with lung cancer progression , we created a bioinformatics-based approach that focuses on human cell-cycle-regulated genes that have evolved only in higher organisms but not in lower eukaryotic cells . In siRNA experiments in lung cancer cells , FLJ10540 was identified as one of several novel targets involved in cell migration and invasion . Here , we demonstrate that PI3K inhibition affects FLJ10540-mediated cell migration and invasion and further , that FLJ10540 knockdown ablates AKT-Ser(473) phosphorylation . Taken together , these findings indicate that the FLJ10540/PI3K/AKT pathway may harbor new therapeutic targets for treating invasive lung adenocarcinoma .
Stannous chloride ( SnCl(2) ) and UVA induce DNA lesions through ROS . The aim of this work was to study the toxicity induced by UVA preillumination , followed by SnCl(2) treatment . E. coli BER mutants were used to identify genes which could play a role in DNA lesion repair generated by these agents . The survival assays showed ( i ) The nfo mutant was the most sensitive to SnCl(2) ; ( ii ) lethal synergistic effect was observed after UVA pre-illumination , plus SnCl(2) incubation , the nfo mutant being the most sensitive ; ( iii ) wild type and nfo mutants , transformed with pBW21 plasmid ( nfo(+) ) had their survival increased following treatments . The alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis assays pointed that ( i ) UVA induced DNA breaks and fpg mutant was the most sensitive ; ( ii ) SnCl(2)-induced DNA strand breaks were higher than those from UVA and nfo mutant had the slowest repair kinetics ; ( iii ) UVA + SnCl(2) promoted an increase in DNA breaks than SnCl(2) and , again , nfo mutant displayed the slowest repair kinetics . In summary , Nfo protects E. coli cells against damage induced by SnCl(2) and UVA + SnCl(2) .
During the course of inflammation and its resolution , macrophages are exposed to various cytotoxic materials , including reactive oxygen species . Thus , macrophages require a protective machinery against oxidative stress to survive at the inflammatory site . Here , we showed that xCT , a component of transport system x(c)(-) , was significantly up-regulated in activated infiltrating cells , including macrophages and neutrophils at the inflammatory site . System x(c)(-) mediates the uptake of extracellular L-cystine and is consequently responsible for maintenance of intracellular glutathione levels . We established a loss-of-function mouse mutant line of xCT by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis . Macrophages from xCT(mu/mu) mice showed cell death in association with the excessive release of high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 upon stimulation with LPS , suggesting that xCT deficiency causes unremitting inflammation because of the impaired survival of activated macrophages at the inflammatory site . Subcutaneous injection of 3-methylcholanthrene ( 3-MCA ) induced the generation of fibrosarcoma in association with inflammation . When 3-MCA was injected s.c. into mice , xCT mRNA was up-regulated in situ . In xCT(mu/mu) mice , inflammatory cytokines ( such as IL-1beta and TNFalpha ) were overexpressed , and the generation of 3-MCA-induced fibrosarcoma was accelerated . These results clearly indicate that the defect of the protective system against oxidative stress impaired survival of activated macrophages and subsequently enhanced tumorigenecity .
Colon cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Western countries . Basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) was up-regulated in patients with colon cancer and was considered as a potential therapeutic target . In this study , we first demonstrated that a novel bFGF-binding peptide ( named P7 ) inhibited proliferation of several colon cancer cell lines including HT-29 , LoVo , and Caco2 cells stimulated by bFGF . Further investigations with HT-29 cells indicated that P7 arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase of bFGF-stimulated cells , reduced the levels of phospho-Erk1/Erk2 induced by bFGF , and caused significant changes in the expression of proteins related to proliferation , cell cycle , and cancer . Our results suggested that the bFGF-binding peptide has a potential antitumor effect on colon cancer .
" Reactive " or activated stroma characterizes many malignancies including breast cancers . Recently , we isolated a reactive mouse mammary gland stromal cell line called BJ3Z . These cells express alpha-smooth muscle actin and stromal cell-derived factor 1 ( SDF-1 ) and are tumorigenic when injected into mice . Here we show that , in vivo , BJ3Z cells influence the angiogenesis and proliferation of xenografted estrogen receptor ( ER)-positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cell-derived solid tumors . The growth-promoting effects of BJ3Z cells are equivalent to those of estradiol ( E(2) ) . BJ3Z cells also increase the proliferation of normal mouse mammary luminal cells adjacent to tumors . In vitro , BJ3Z cells reorganize and increase the proliferation of cocultured malignant MCF-7 and normal human breast MCF10A cells grown as organoids in three-dimensional culture . The effects of BJ3Z cells on MCF-7 cells are equivalent to those of E(2) . In contrast , BJ3Z cells do not alter the growth of highly aggressive ER-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells . We show that BJ3Z cells secrete vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . The growth of MCF-7 organoids induced by BJ3Z can be inhibited by antagonists of VEGF and SDF-1 . Conversely , recombinant VEGF stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 , but not MDA-MB-231 , organoids . We conclude that , in addition to angiogenesis , VEGF released by activated stroma increases the growth of ER-positive malignant epithelial cells and of adjacent normal epithelium . Because activated stroma can substitute for E(2) and fosters hormone-independent growth of ER-positive tumors , we suggest that breast cancers exhibiting intrinsic hormone resistance may respond to antiangiogenic therapies .
In the present study , we investigated if the intracellular Cl(-) affects cell growth and cell cycle progression of androgen-independent prostate cancer PC3 cells . PC3 cells cultured in a medium containing 113 mM Cl(-) for 96 h grew up 9-fold in cell number , while PC3 cells cultured in an 8 mM-Cl(-)-containing culture medium showed complete arrest of cell growth even after culture for 96 h . Exposure of cells to the 8 mM-Cl(-) culture medium diminished phosphorylation levels of Rb and cdc2 , which are respectively key accelerators of transition from G(1) to S phase and G(2) to M phase in cell cycle progression . Culturing cells in the 8 mM-Cl(-)-containing culture medium upregulated the protein expression level of p21 ( a CDK inhibitor ) inhibiting transition of G(1) to S phase , and diminished the incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine ( EdU ; a thymidine analogue ) into DNA . These results suggest that cells cultured in the low Cl(-) medium prolonged the duration of all phases of the cell cycle ( G(1) , S , and G(2)/M ) , thereby abolishing overall cell cycle progression . Effects of culturing cells in the low Cl(-) culture medium on cell cycle progression would be mediated via a change in the intracellular Cl(-) concentration ( [ Cl(-)](i) ) , since [ Cl(-)](i) was decreased under a low Cl(-) culture medium . To clarify this possibility , we studied effects of furosemide and bumetanide , Na+/K+/2Cl(-) cotransporter ( NKCC ) inhibitors , on proliferation of PC3 cells . Furosemide and bumetanide decreased [ Cl(-)](i) and cell growth of PC3 cells . These results suggest that a change in [ Cl(-)](i) would play a critical role in this growth mechanism .
Palmitoylation is required for the activities of several cancer-associated proteins , making the palmitoyl acyltransferase ( PAT ) enzymes that catalyze these reactions potential targets for anticancer therapeutics . In this study , we sought to identify and characterize a human PAT with activity toward N-terminally myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins . NIH/3t3 cells were stably transfected with vectors containing no insert , wild type human DHHC20 , or a serine-substituted DHHS20 mutant . Compared with control cells , cells overexpressing wild-type DHHC20 displayed an increase in palmitoylation activity toward a peptide that mimics the N-terminus of myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins , but had no change in activity toward a peptide that mimics the C-terminus of farnesylated and palmitoylated proteins . Cells expressing DHHS20 had no significant change in activity toward either peptide . Overexpression of DHHC20 also caused phenotypic changes consistent with cellular transformation , including colony formation in soft agar , decreased contact inhibition of growth , and increased proliferation under low-serum conditions . Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses of human tissues demonstrated that DHHC20 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner , and is overexpressed in several types of human tumors , including ovarian , breast and prostate . Overall , these results demonstrate that DHHC20 is a human N-terminal-myristoyl-directed PAT involved in cellular transformation , that may play a role in cancer .
To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying altered T cell response in renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) patients , we compared autologous and allogeneic CD8(+) T cell responses against RCC line from RCC patients and their HLA-matched donors , using mixed lymphocyte/tumor cell cultures ( MLTCs ) . In addition , we analyzed the expression of molecules associated with cell cycle regulation . Autologous MLTC responder CD8(+) T cells showed cytotoxic activity against RCC cell lines ; however the analysis of the distribution of CD8(+) T-cell subsets revealed that allogenic counterparts mediate superior antitumor efficacy . In RCC patients , a decreased proliferative response to tumor , associated with defects in JAK3/STAT5/6 expression that led to increased p27KIP1 expression and alterations in the cell cycle , was observed . These data define a molecular pathway involved in cell cycle regulation that is associated with the dysfunction of tumor-specific CD8(+) effector cells . If validated , this may define a therapeutic target in the setting of patients with RCC .
Currently , there are no satisfactory biomarkers available to screen for nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) . Nitric oxide ( NO ) , produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , has been suggested to cause nitrative and oxidative stress , leading to the accumulation of 8-nitroguanine ( 8-NitroG ) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) and the subsequent transversion mutation of DNA . The aim of this study was to evaluate iNOS expression and the status of nitrative and oxidative stress in NPC . Fifty-nine cases of NPC and 39 cases of chronic nasopharyngitis were investigated to examine the expression of iNOS and the formation of 8-NitroG and 8-OHdG , using double-immunofluorescent staining . The statistical differences in immunoreactivities were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test . Thirty-six patients from the 57 cases of NPC and 36 healthy controls were investigated to examine the level of serum 8-OHdG , using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . The statistical differences were analyzed using a t test . Strong DNA lesions were observed in the cancer cells of NPC patients . All cases of NPC were positive for 8-NitroG and 8-OHdG , and 54 ( 94.7% ) were positive for iNOS . NPC samples exhibited significantly more intense staining for 8-NitroG , 8-OHdG and iNOS than those of chronic nasopharyngitis ( P < 0.05 , respectively ) . The mean value of serum 8-OHdG in the 36 NPC patients was 0.538 +/- 0.336 ng/ml compared to 0.069 +/- 0.059 ng/ml for the healthy controls . The difference in the serum levels of 8-OHdG between the NPC patients and controls was statistically significant ( P < 0.05 ) . Our present findings suggest that pathological stimulation of nasopharyngeal tissue , caused by bacterial , viral or parasitic inflammation , may lead to nitrative and oxidative DNA lesions , caused by NO . This may contribute to the cause and development of NPC . Thus , 8-NitroG and 8-OHdG could be potential biomarkers for evaluating the risk of NPC . Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying nitrative and oxidative DNA damage may provide clues to molecular targets for new approaches of NPC prevention .
This research aims to give a new insight to the relationship between host local immune response and the biological behaviour of the tumor by evaluating of intratumoral natural killer ( NK ) cells and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) expressions in oral squamous cell carcinomas . New paraffin sections of the deepest parts of the 46 cases of oral squamous cell carcinomas were immunohistochemically treated by CD57 , selected as NK cell indicator , and TNFalpha monoclonal antibodies . The tumors were graded according to histopathologic grading scores of invasive margins and categorized into 2 groups as " good " and " poor " prognostic groups . Fifteen cases , from which could be obtained full clinical data , were clinically staged and because of the scarcity of the cases in each group were divided , again , two groups as group 1 : stage I+stage II and group 2 : stage III+stage IV . The expression levels of CD57 and TNFalpha were evaluated according to histopathologic grading groups and clinical staging groups . The results showed that the density of CD57+cells ( NK cells ) was statistically lower in tumors graded as poor prognostic group compared to the cases in good prognostic group . On the contrary , expression level of TNFalpha was statistically higher in poor prognostic group . These findings suggested that increased secretion of TNFalpha in the tumors , which show high invasive potential , may be one of the facilitating factors for tumor invasion and be responsible from suppression of NK cells . Withdrawal of NK cells in the high invasive tumor areas also reminds the necessity of certain shared genetic rearrangements in tumor cells for getting protected from NK cell attacks and moving ahead within the extracellular matrix .
The transcription factor NF-kappaB is constitutively active in pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Here we explore the contribution of NF-kappaB to the malignant phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells in addition to its anti-apoptotic role . Block of NF-kappaB signalling by non-destructible IkappaBalpha rendered cells resistant to TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . In contrast , NF-kappaB activation by TNF-alpha or expression of constitutively active IKK2 induced an EMT-phenotype with up-regulation of vimentin and ZEB1 , and down-regulation of E-cadherin . EMT could also be induced in cells with defective TGF-beta signalling . Functional assays demonstrated reduced or strongly enhanced migration and invasion upon NF-kappaB inhibition or activation , respectively .
Mouse models can be useful for increasing the understanding of lung tumorigenesis and assessing the potential of chemopreventive agents . We explored the role of inflammation in lung tumor development in mice with knockout of the tumor suppressor Gprc5a . Examination of normal lung tissue and tumors from 51 Gprc5a(+/+) ( adenoma incidence , 9.8% ; adenocarcinoma , 0% ) and 38 Gprc5a(-/-) mice ( adenoma , 63% ; adenocarcinoma , 21% ) revealed macrophage infiltration into lungs of 45% of the Gprc5a(-/-) mice and 8% of Gprc5a(+/+) mice and the direct association of macrophages with 42% of adenomas and 88% of adenocarcinomas in the knockout mice . Gprc5a(-/-) mouse lungs contained higher constitutive levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and were more sensitive than lungs of Gprc5a(+/+) mice to stimulation of NF-kappaB activation by lipopolysaccharide in vivo . Studies with epithelial cells cultured from tracheas of Gprc5a(-/-) and Gprc5a(+/+) mice revealed that Gprc5a loss is associated with increased cell proliferation , resistance to cell death in suspension , and increased basal , tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced , and lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappaB activation , which were reversed partially in Gprc5a(-/-) adenocarcinoma cells by reexpression of Gprc5a . Compared with Gprc5a(+/+) cells , the Gprc5a(-/-) cells produced higher levels of chemokines and cytokines and their conditioned medium induced more extensive macrophage migration . Silencing Gprc5a and the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB in Gprc5a(+/+) and Gprc5a(-/-) cells , respectively , reversed these effects . Thus , Gprc5a loss enhances NF-kappaB activation in lung epithelial cells , leading to increased autocrine and paracrine interactions , cell autonomy , and enhanced inflammation , which may synergize in the creation of a tumor-promoting microenvironment .
Ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) kinase is a central player in cellular response to DNA damage . Phosphorylation of the histone H2AX by ATM is required for the accumulation of repair proteins at the sites of double-strand breaks . Recently , it was reported that the histone acetyltransferase Tat interactive protein-60 ( IPP60 ) is required to acetylate ATM prior to its activation . The RuvB-like proteins TIP48 and TIP49 are known to be necessary for the assembly and functional activity of the TIP60 acetyltransferase complex . In the present communication , we investigated the requirements of IIP48 and IIP49 for ATM activation by monitoring the cell cycle distribution and H2AX phosphorylation after irradiation of IIP48- and IIP49-depleted cells . We found that neither the cell cycle norgammay-H2AX were affected in IIP48- and IIP49-silenced cells , suggesting that the IIP60 chromatin modification complex is not engaged in DNA damage signaling upstream of ATM .
BACKGROUND Autotaxin ( ATX ) is an extracellular lysophospholipase D that generates lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) from lysophosphatidylcholine ( LPC ) . Both ATX and LPA have been shown to be involved in many cancers . However , the functional role of ATX and the regulation of ATX expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) remain elusive . RESULTS In this study , ATX expression was evaluated in tissues from 38 human HCC and 10 normal control subjects . ATX was detected mainly in tumor cells within tissue sections and its over-expression in HCC was specifically correlated with inflammation and liver cirrhosis . In addition , ATX expression was examined in normal human hepatocytes and liver cancer cell lines . Hepatoma Hep3B and Huh7 cells displayed stronger ATX expression than hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells and normal hepatocytes did . Proinflammtory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) promoted ATX expression and secretion selectively in Hep3B and Huh7 cells , which led to a corresponding increase in lysophospholipase-D activity . Moreover , we explored the mechanism governing the expression of ATX in hepatoma cells and established a critical role of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) in basal and TNF-alpha induced ATX expression . Further study showed that secreted enzymatically active ATX stimulated Hep3B cell invasion . CONCLUSIONS This report highlights for the first time the clinical and biological evidence for the involvement of ATX in human HCC . Our observation that links the TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB axis and the ATX-LPA signaling pathway suggests that ATX is likely playing an important role in inflammation related liver tumorigenesis .
Epidemiologic studies have examined the association between fruit and vegetable ( F&V ) consumption and the risk of cancer . Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed , such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities ; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate . We investigated , in a randomized , controlled , crossover feeding trial , the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage ; resistance to gamma -irradiation damage ; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes , measured by the Comet assay . We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures . Healthy men ( n = 11 ) and women ( n = 17 ) , age 20 to 40 yr , provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period . Overall , F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes . The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma -irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity , but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear . A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage . With inconsistent findings in the literature , additional dietary intervention studies on the effect of F&V on DNA damage and repair are needed .
NKX3.1 is a homeodomain protein that functions as a dosage sensitive prostate-specific transcription factor . Diminished NKX3.1 expression is associated with prostate epithelial cell proliferation in vitro and with increasing Gleason grade in patient samples . Mouse Nkx3.1 also functions as a negative regulator of prostate cell growth in prostate cancer models . Identifying biological and environmental factors that modulate NKX3.1 accumulation is therefore central to efforts aimed at elucidating prostate growth control mechanisms . To determine the effect of inflammation on Nxk3.1 accumulation , bacterial prostatitis was induced by intraurethral inoculation of a uropathogenic E. coli strain in mice . Nkx3.1 expression was profoundly reduced in infected prostate lobes and correlated with increased expression of a proliferation marker . Androgen receptor levels were also reduced in concert with Nkx3.1 , and a marked increase in the basal cell marker p63 was observed . Analyses of the inflammatory infiltrate revealed a classic acute inflammatory response that attained characteristics of a chronic state within fourteen days postinoculation . Comparison of the four prostate lobes revealed clear differences in the extent of inflammation . These data demonstrate that acute inflammation in response to a bacterial agent in the prostate is associated with a significant diminution in the level of a key regulator of prostate cell proliferation . These observations provide a plausible mechanism whereby prostate inflammation may establish a local environment conducive to epithelial cell growth .
OBJECTIVE To clarify the relationship between the expression of pol beta and DNA damage /repair induced by Benzo(a)pyrene ( BaP ) . METHODS pol beta wild-type cells ( pol beta +/+ ) , pol beta null cells ( pol beta -/- ) and wild-type pol beta overexpressed cells ( pol beta oe ) which had the same genetic background were studied . Firstly , RT-PCR and Western blot targeting to pol beta were carried out to measure the expression of pol beta mRNA and protein in above three kinds of cells , then MTT test and single cell gel electrophoresis ( comet assay ) were used to compare cell viability and DNA damage/repair of the three kinds of cells when exposed to BaP . RESULTS There was pol beta deletion in pol beta -/- cells and the level of pol beta mRNA and protein in pol beta oe cells was twice higher than that in pol beta +/+ cells . BaP could induce DNA damage and reduce cell viability , when compared with pol beta +/+ cells , IC50 of pol beta -/- cells was remarkably lower , DNA was prone to damage and more difficult to be repaired , on the other hand , IC50 of pol beta oe cells was obviously higher and the damage effect on DNA was weaker and prone to be repaired . CONCLUSION Pol beta played an important role in the repair of DNA damage induced by BaP , deficiency of pol beta could decrease the DNA repair capability of cells , and overexpression of pol beta could help cells response to DNA damage and protect cells from death in a certain degree .
The tumor suppressor LKB1 is inactivated in 90% of Peutz-Jeghers cancer syndrome , 30-40% of non-small cell lung carcinoma , and a variety of other cancers , indicating the loss of LKB1 activity is a critical step in oncogenesis . However , current understanding of LKB1 function is largely limited to the results from cancer cells , and how LKB1 inactivation initiates malignant transformation in normal cells remains unclear . Here we ablated endogenous expression of LKB1 in two normal cell lines : human embryonic kidney 293T cells ( HEK-293T cells ) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) by LKB1-specific short hairpin RNAs . Downregulation of endogenous LKB1 lead to a facilitated G(1)/S transition , accompanied by a concomitant increase in Rb phosphorylation ( Ser(807/811) ) . Furthermore , reduced expression of p53 and p16 was observed in LKB1 ablated cells , while no differences were detected for cyclin D1 and cyclin E. These results jointly suggest that endogenous LKB1 knockdown accelerates cell cycle progression through G(1)/S checkpoint in HEK-293T cells and HUVECs , which is at least in part , mediated by decline of p53 and p16 pathways . Our findings provided a plausible mechanism by which loss of LKB1 expression in normal cells contributes to the formation of malignancies .
Although contact inhibition is a fundamental process for multicellular organisms , how proliferation is inhibited at high cellular densities remains poorly characterized . Here we show that 4E-BP1 , one major repressor of cap-dependent translation , plays a critical role in density-mediated cell cycle arrest. 4E-BP1 promoter is activated and 4E-BP1 protein amount increases as cells reach confluence . Conversely , a much less marked density-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation is observed upon 4E-BP1 silencing . We further show that at high density , progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle is faster and Cyclin D1 protein is induced in different cell types where 4E-BP1 has been either downregulated ( stable shRNA expression or transient siRNA transfection ) or removed ( knock-out ) . Thus 4E-BP1 appears as an important mediator of contact inhibition .
BACKGROUND Elevated levels of air pollution are associated with increased risk of lung cancer . Particulate matter ( PM ) contains transition metals that may potentiate neoplastic development through the induction of oxidative stress and inflammation , a lung cancer risk factor . Vanadium pentoxide ( V2O5 ) is a component of PM derived from fuel combustion as well as a source of occupational exposure in humans . In the current investigation we examined the influence of genetic background on susceptibility to V2O5-induced inflammation and evaluated whether V2O5 functions as a tumor promoter using a 2-stage ( initiation-promotion ) model of pulmonary neoplasia in mice . RESULTS A/J , BALB/cJ ( BALB ) , and C57BL/6J ( B6 ) mice were treated either with the initiator 3-methylcholanthrene ( MCA ; 10 microg/g ; i.p. ) or corn oil followed by 5 weekly aspirations of V2O5 or PBS and pulmonary tumors were enumerated 20 weeks following MCA treatment . Susceptibility to V2O5-induced pulmonary inflammation was assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) , and chemokines , transcription factor activity , and MAPK signaling were quantified in lung homogenates . We found that treatment of animals with MCA followed by V2O5 promoted lung tumors in both A/J ( 10.3 +/- 0.9 tumors/mouse ) and BALB ( 2.2 +/- 0.36 ) mice significantly above that observed with MCA/PBS or V2O5 alone ( P < 0.05 ) . No tumors were observed in the B6 mice in any of the experimental groups . Mice sensitive to tumor promotion by V2O5 were also found to be more susceptible to V2O5-induced pulmonary inflammation and hyperpermeability ( A/J>BALB>B6 ) . Differential strain responses in inflammation were positively associated with elevated levels of the chemokines KC and MCP-1 , higher NFkappaB and c-Fos binding activity , as well as sustained ERK1/2 activation in lung tissue . CONCLUSIONS In this study we demonstrate that V2O5 , an occupational and environmentally relevant metal oxide , functions as an in vivo lung tumor promoter among different inbred strains of mice . Further , we identified a positive relationship between tumor promotion and susceptibility to V2O5-induced pulmonary inflammation . These findings suggest that repeated exposures to V2O5 containing particles may augment lung carcinogenesis in susceptible individuals through oxidative stress mediated pathways .
The mechanisms of formation of sister chromatid exchanges ( SCEs ) and chromosome aberrations following inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by 3-aminobenzamide were studied in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines deficient in different repair pathways . The results confirm earlier findings that ( a ) the ' spontaneous ' SCEs are formed due to the incorporated BrdU in the DNA , ( b ) ' spontaneous ' and induced SCEs originate from different mechanisms , and ( c ) SCEs and chromatid exchanges are formed by different pathways .
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) such as dibenzo[a,l]pyrene ( DBP ) are wide-spread environmental pollutants most probably mutagenic and carcinogenic to humans . Detailed data on the cytogenetic effects of anti-11,12-dihydroxy-13,14-epoxy-11,12,13,14-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,l]pyrene ( DBPDE ) in mammalian cells are not available in the literature . The aim of this study is to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the induction of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges ( SCEs ) by DBPDE in mammalian cells . In order to achieve this a parental ( AA8 ) and different DNA repair-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell lines such as UV4 , UV5 , UV61 ( nucleotide excision repair , NER ) , EM9 ( base excision repair , BER ) , irs1SF ( homologous recombination repair , HRR ) and V3-3 ( non-homologous end joining , NHEJ ) were used . The most sensitive cell lines for DBPDE-induced chromosome aberrations were EM9 and irs1SF , while EM9 and V3-3 cell lines were the most sensitive in terms of SCEs induction . It can be suggested that the BER pathway plays an important role in the repair of lesions induced by DBPDE , affecting both chromosomal aberrations and SCEs induction . Moreover , the HRR pathway seems to play a role in cellular resistance to DBPDE mainly in terms of chromosomal aberration induction while the NHEJ pathway takes part affecting only the induction of SCEs .
Bulky DNA adducts are considered a potential biomarker of cancer risk . In this study , the association between various lifestyle , environmental , and genetic factors and the levels of bulky DNA adducts in peripheral leukocytes was examined in a study group nested within a population-based prospective Danish cohort . At enrollment , blood samples were collected and information on lifestyle , including dietary and smoking habits , obtained . Previously , bulky DNA adducts were measured in 245 individuals who developed lung cancer and 255 control members of the cohort . Of these 500 individuals , data on 375 individuals were included in this study , excluding 125 cases , which developed lung cancer within the first 3 yr after blood sampling . Bulky DNA adduct levels were measured by 32P-postlabeling technique and polymorphisms in carcinogen metabolism and DNA repair genes were determined . Potential predictors of bulky DNA adduct levels were analyzed by univariate and multivariate regression analyses . Women tended to have higher adduct levels than men . Living in central Copenhagen and surface darkness of fried meat and fish were associated with quantitative higher adduct levels . No significant associations were found between dietary factors or smoking and DNA adduct levels . Further , the results showed no prominent associations between any of 12 genetic polymorphisms and adduct levels . Overall , our study showed only few associations between dietary , environmental , and genetic factors and levels of bulky DNA adducts measured in peripheral leukocytes in a general Danish population .
Obesity and related metabolic abnormalities are risk factors for colorectal cancer . A state of chronic inflammation and adipocytokine imbalance may play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis . Statins , which are commonly used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia , are known to possess anti-inflammatory effects . Statins also exert chemopreventive properties against various cancers . The present study examined the effects of pitavastatin , a recently developed lipophilic statin , on the development of azoxymethane ( AOM)-initiated colonic premalignant lesions in C57BL/KsJ-db/db ( db/db ) obese mice . Male db/db mice were administrated weekly subcutaneous injections of AOM ( 15 mg/kg body weight ) for 4 weeks and then were subsequently fed a diet containing 1 ppm or 10 ppm pitavastatin for 8 weeks . Feeding with either dose of pitavastatin significantly reduced the number of colonic premalignant lesions , beta-catenin accumulated crypts , by inhibiting proliferation and the surrounding inflammation . Pitavastatin increased the serum levels of adiponectin while conversely decreasing the serum levels of total cholesterol , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , interleukin ( IL)-6 , IL-18 , and leptin . Pitavastatin also caused a significant increase in the expression of phosphorylated form of the AMP-activated kinase ( AMPK ) protein on the colonic mucosa of AOM-treated mice . In addition , the expression levels of TNF-alpha , IL-6 , IL-18 , and COX-2 mRNAs on the colonic mucosa of AOM-treated mice were decreased by treatment with this agent . These findings suggest that pitavastatin attenuates chronic inflammation and improves the imbalance of adipocytokines , both of which are caused by the presence of excess adipose tissues , thereby preventing the development of colonic premalignancies in an obesity-related colon cancer model . Therefore , some types of statins , including pitavastatin , may be a useful chemoprevention modality for colon cancer in obese individuals .
OBJECTIVE Although downregulation of neural cell adhesion molecule ( NCAM ) has been correlated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , it is also possible that colon cancer spreading comes from reducing tumor cell adhesion through NCAM polysialylation , as occurs in lung carcinoma or Wilms ' tumor . METHODS To prove this hypothesis , we have performed a prospective study on tumor and control specimens from 39 CRC patients , which were immunostained for NCAM and PSA ( polysialic acid ) expression . RESULTS Tumor versus control expression of NCAM and PSA epitopes in tissue specimens , as well as correlation between tumor expression and clinicopathological features , were statistically analyzed . Results showed a low constitutive expression of NCAM and PSA ( PSA-NCAM ) in control tissue , which reached a statistically significant increase in the tumor tissue . Likewise , the presence and number of lymph node metastases at surgery were correlated with NCAM expression and PSA/NCAM coexpression . CONCLUSIONS These data highlight the importance of taking into account PSA-associated epitopes when dealing with NCAM cell expression studies in tumor development and progression . The analysis of PSA and NCAM expression in CRC suggests a new way , other than downregulation of NCAM , in order to escape contact inhibition and promote cell tumor spreading in colorectal cancer .
BACKGROUND/AIMS Adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder is a highly malignant neoplasm. p16 is a tumor suppressor gene protein , which is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that regulates the G1-S phase of the cell cycle . The purpose of the present study was to investigate the expression of p16 in gallbladder carcinoma and its precancerous conditions and to examine the relationship between p16 expression and clinicopathological parameters . METHODOLOGY Formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 20 cases of normal gallbladder , 20 cases of chronic cholecystitis , 20 cases of gallbladder adenoma , 20 cases of dysplasia , and 58 cases of adenocarcinoma were examined . The expression of p16 was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis . RESULTS In normal gallbladder , no expression of p16 was found . In chronic cholecystitis , expression of p16 was not found . In gallbladder adenomas , expression of p16 was found in 20% ( 4/20 ) . In low grade dyspalsias , expression of p16 was not found . In high grade dysplasias , p16 expression was present in 45.0% ( 9/20 ) . In gallbladder adenocarcinomas , p16 expression was found in 27.6% ( 16/58 ) . Expression of p16 correlated significantly with histologic grade ( p < 0.05 ) . No correlation was found between p16 expression and age , gender , tumor size , gross type , location , vascular invasion , lymph node metastasis , and TNM stage , respectively . CONCLUSIONS P16 protein overexpression is an early and relatively common event in carcinogenesis of gallbladder carcinoma . Expression of p16 protein is absent in normal or chronic cholecystitis . Expression of p16 may be an ancillary diagnostic marker of gallbladder carcinoma and its precancerous conditions .
Among several types of DNA lesions , the DNA double strand breaks ( DSBs ) are one of the most deleterious and harmful . Mammalian cells mount a coordinated response to DSBs with the aim of appropriately repair the DNA damage . Indeed , failure of the DNA damage response ( DDR ) can lead to the development of cancer-prone genetic diseases . The identification and development of drugs targeting proteins involved in the DDR is even more investigated , as it gives the possibility to specifically target cancer cells . Indeed , the administration of DNA repair inhibitors could be combined with chemo- and radiotherapy , thus improving the eradication of tumor cells . Here , we provide an overview about DSBs damage response , focusing on the role of the DSBs repair mechanisms , of chromatin modifications , and of the cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 which plays a multifunctional role in controlling genome integrity . Moreover , the most investigated DSBs enzyme inhibitors tested as potential therapeutic agents for anti-cancer therapy are reported .
OBJECTIVE To explore the association between DNA damage induced by vinyl chloride monomer ( VCM ) and polymorphisms of DNA repair genes and xenobiotic metabolism genes of VCM . METHODS Comet assay was employed to detect DNA damage . Based on the status of DNA damage , the VCM exposure workers were divided into two groups : DNA damage group ( 75 ) and control group ( 75 ) . Case-control design was used to investigate the association between the genetic polymorphisms and DNA damage induced by VCM . Genotypes of XRCC1 ( Arg194Trp , Arg280His and Arg399Gln ) , XPD ( Ile199Met , Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln ) and CYP2E1 were identified by the PCR-RFLP . PCR assay was used to detect positive and null genotype of GSTT1 and GSTM1 . RESULTS Univariate analysis showed that the CYP2E1 c1c2/c2c2 and XPD751 Lys/Gln and Gln/Gln genotypes were significantly associated with the increased levels of DNA damage , XRCCI 339 Arg/Gln and Gln/Gln genotypes were significantly associated with the decreased levels of DNA damage ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.05 , respectively ) . Logistic regression analysis showed that there was significant association between the genotypes of XRCC1 194 , XRCC1 399 , XPD 751 , CYP2E1 and DNA damages . A prominent risk decreasing of DNA damage was observed for those individuals possessing XRCC1 399Arg/Gln + Gln/Gln genotypes ( OR : 0.35 , 95%CI : 0.12 approximately 1.01 , respectively ) ; The results also showed that there were significant associations between CYP2E1 c1c2/c2c2 and DNA damage both in high and low VCM-exposed groups ( OR : 2.57 , 95%CI : 1.01 approximately 6.59 and OR : 2.57 , 95%CI : 0.99 approximately 6.87 ) . CONCLUSION Cumulative exposure dose and genotypes of XRCC1 194 , XRCC1 399 , XPD 751 and CYP2E1 may modulate the DNA damage induced by VCM exposure .
OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to examine the expression of MCM-2 and conventional proliferation marker Ki-67 in breast carcinoma by stereologic technique and to compare it with various clinicopathologic parameters . METHODS The expression of MCM-2 and Ki-67 on paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections of patients with invasive breast carcinoma was analyzed immunohistochemically . Stereologic method was used for evaluation of the percentage of positively stained tumor cells . RESULTS Significant positive correlation was found between the expression of MCM-2 and that of Ki-67 ( r = 0.74 , p < 0.001 ) . MCM-2 and Ki-67 expression was significantly associated with histologic grade ( p < 0.05 ) , and negative correlation was observed between MCM-2 or Ki-67 expression and estrogen status ( p < 0.05 ) . No significant association was observed between MCM-2 or Ki-67 expression and patient age , tumor size , lymph node status , clinical stage and menopausal status . CONCLUSION Our results suggest that MCM-2 expression is significantly associated with histologic grade of breast carcinoma and with cell proliferation capacity ( Ki-67 labelling index ) . Additional studies are required using the stereologic method to compare and understand the utility of Ki-67 and MCM-2 expression in invasive breast carcinoma ( Tab. 1 , Fig. 4 , Ref. 34 ) .

XRCC4 , in association with DNA ligase IV , is thought to play a critical role in the ligation of two DNA ends in DNA double-strand break ( DSB ) repair through non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) pathway . In the present study , we captured radiation-induced chromatin-recruitment of XRCC4 by biochemical fractionation using detergent Nonidet P-40 . A subpopulation of XRCC4 changed into a form that is resistant to the extraction with 0.5% Nonidet P-40-containing buffer after irradiation . This form of XRCC4 was liberated by micrococcal nuclease treatment , indicating that it had been tethered to chromatin DNA . This chromatin-recruitment of XRCC4 could be seen immediately ( < 0.1 hr ) after irradiation and remained up to 4 hr after 20 Gy irradiation . It was seen even after irradiation of small doses , i.e. , 2 Gy , but the residence of XRCC4 on chromatin was very transient after 2 Gy irradiation , returning to near normal level in 0.2-0.5 hr after irradiation . The chromatin-bound XRCC4 represented only approximately 1% of total XRCC4 molecules even after 20 Gy irradiation and the quantitative analysis using purified protein as the reference suggested that only a few XRCC4-DNA ligase IV complexes were recruited to each DNA end . We further show that the chromatin-recruitment of XRCC4 was not attenuated by wortmannin , an inhibitor of DNA-PK , or siRNA-mediated knockdown of the DNA-PK catalytic subunit ( DNA-PKcs ) , indicating that this process does not require DNA-PKcs . These results would provide us with useful experimental tools and important insights to understand the DNA repair process through NHEJ pathway .
Oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) is the most common malignant tumor in the oral and maxillofacial region . The mechanism of carcinogenesis of OSCC is still unclear . Based on the previous cell line , HIOEC-B(a)P-96 ( HB96 ) , which we obtained by HPV16 E6/E7-immortalized human oral epithelial cells ( HIOEC ) and benzo(a)pyrene inducement , we prepared a new HB-second generation cancer cell line ( HB-2 ) by continuous passage . Its characteristics such as morphology , proliferation activity , karyotype , and tumorigenesis were studied . The HB-2 cells displayed uncontrolled cell division and lost contact inhibition leading to cell overlap . Cells were polygonal and unevenly shaped , with an increased nucleus versus plasma ratio . Increased proliferative activity was confirmed by MTT assays . The tumorigenicity was confirmed by tumor growth experiments in nude mice . Therefore , the HB-2 and HB96 cell lines are useful tools to study the mechanism of carcinogenesis of OSCC in vitro for future genomic and proteomic analyses .
The effect of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) on Vero cell proliferation was investigated , with the attempts to assess the possible hormetic dose-response and to compare their structure-dependent toxicity . Both PCB congeners revealed low doses stimulation in our experiment . However , significant cytotoxicity was only observed in PCB 52 concentrations larger than 0.1 microg ml(-1) , while there was no significant inhibition in PCB 77-treated cells at concentrations selected . Furthermore , the time-dependent cytotoxic trends were different . The comparison between PCB 52 and PCB 77 indicated that the cytotoxic mechanisms involved in coplanar or non-coplanar PCB congener exposure were different , and this difference might be associated with individual genotoxicity and the release of contact inhibition , respectively .
Tumor aerobic glycolysis , or the Warburg effect , plays important roles in tumor survival , growth , and metastasis . Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 ( PKM2 ) is a key enzyme that regulates aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells . Recent research has shown that PKM2 can be used as a tumor marker for diagnosis and , in particular , as a potential target for cancer therapy . We investigated the effects of combining shRNA targeting PKM2 and docetaxel on human A549 lung carcinoma cells both in vivo and in vitro . We observed that the shRNA can significantly downregulate the expression level of PKM2 . The decrease of PKM2 resulted in a decrease in ATP synthesis , which caused intracellular accumulation of docetaxel . Furthermore , the combination of pshRNA-pkm2 and docetaxel inhibited tumor growth and promoted more cancer cell apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro . Our findings suggest that targeting tumor glycolysis can increase the efficacy of chemotherapy . In particular , the targeting of PKM2 could , to some extent , be a new way of reversing chemotherapy resistance to cancer therapy .
By intravenous ( but not oral ) application of ascorbate , millimolar serum concentrations can be reached , which are preferentially cytotoxic to cancer cells . Cytotoxicity is mediated by transition metal-dependent generation of H(2)O(2) in the interstitial space . In this study , the sensitivity of neuroblastoma cells ( Kelly , SK-N-SH ) to ascorbate and H(2)O(2) and their defense mechanisms against H(2)O(2) were investigated . Since aerobic glycolysis ( the Warburg effect ) is a feature of many tumour cells , their glucose consumption and lactate production were monitored . Furthermore , synthesis and release of ferritin by neuroblastoma cells were analysed in order to examine whether ferritin is possibly an iron source for H(2)O(2) generation . Ascorbate ( 0.6-5.0 mM ) and H(2)O(2) ( 25-100 muM ) were found to be similarly cytotoxic to Kelly and SK-N-SH cells . In each case , cytotoxicity increased if cell concentrations decreased , in accordance with low cell concentrations having lower capacities to detoxify H(2)O(2) . Kelly and SK-N-SH cells produced and released remarkable amounts of lactate and ferritin . We propose the selective cytotoxicity of high dose ascorbate to tumour cells to be due to the preferential generation of H(2)O(2) in the acidic and ferritin-rich tumour microenvironment , combined with reduced defense systems against H(2)O(2) as a consequence of aerobic glycolysis .
The Ras-assocation domain family ( RASSF ) of tumor suppressor proteins until recently contained six proteins named RASSF1-6 . Recently , four novel family members , RASSF7-10 , have been identified by homology searches for RA-domain-containing proteins . These additional RASSF members are divergent and structurally distinct from RASSF1-6 , containing an N-terminal RA domain and lacking the Sav/RASSF/Hpo ( SARAH ) domain . Here , we show that RASSF8 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the murine embryo and in normal human adult tissues . Functionally , RNAi-mediated knockdown of RASSF8 in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell lines , increased anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and enhanced tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) mice . Furthermore , EdU staining of RASSF8-depleted cells showed growth suppression in a manner dependent on contact inhibition . We show that endogenous RASSF8 is not only found in the nucleus , but is also membrane associated at sites of cell-cell adhesion , co-localizing with the adherens junction ( AJ ) component beta-catenin and binding to E-cadherin . Following RASSF8 depletion in two different lung cancer cell lines using alternative small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) sequences , we show that AJs are destabilized and E-cadherin is lost from the cell membrane . The AJ components beta-catenin and p65 are also lost from sites of cell-cell contact and are relocalized to the nucleus with a concomitant increase in beta-catenin-dependent and nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB)-dependent signaling following RASSF8 depletion . RASSF8 may also be required to maintain actin -cytoskeletal organization since immunofluorescence analysis shows a striking disorganization of the actin- cytoskeleton following RASSF8 depletion . Accordingly , scratch wound healing studies show increased cellular migration in RASSF8-deficient cells . These results implicate RASSF8 as a tumor suppressor gene that is essential for maintaining AJs function in epithelial cells and have a role in epithelial cell migration .
Cav-1 ( -/- ) deficient stromal cells are a new genetic model for myofibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts . Using an unbiased informatics analysis of the transcriptional profile of Cav-1 ( -/- ) deficient mesenchymal stromal cells , we have now identified many of the major signaling pathways that are activated by a loss of Cav-1 , under conditions of metabolic restriction ( with low glucose media ) . Our informatics analysis suggests that a loss of Cav-1 induces oxidative stress , which mimics a constitutive pseudo-hypoxic state , leading to ( 1 ) aerobic glycolysis and ( 2 ) inflammation in the tumor stromal microenvironment . This occurs via the activation of two major transcription factors , namely HIF ( aerobic glycolysis ) and NFkappaB ( inflammation ) in Cav-1 ( -/- ) stromal fibroblastic cells . Experimentally , we show that Cav-1 deficient stromal cells may possess defective mitochondria , due to the over-production of nitric oxide ( NO ) , resulting in the tyrosine nitration of the mitochondrial respiratory chain components ( such as complex I ) . Elevated levels of nitro-tyrosine were observed both in Cav-1 ( -/- ) stromal cells , and via acute knock-down with siRNA targeting Cav-1 . Finally , metabolic restriction with mitochondrial ( complex I ) and glycolysis inhibitors was synthetically lethal with a Cav-1 ( -/- ) deficiency in mice . As such , Cav-1 deficient mice show a dramatically reduced mitochondrial reserve capacity . Thus , a mitochondrial defect in Cav-1 deficient stromal cells could drive oxidative stress , leading to aerobic glycolysis , and inflammation , in the tumor microenvironment . These stromal alterations may underlie the molecular basis of the " reverse Warburg effect " , and could provide the key to targeted anti-cancer therapies using metabolic inhibitors . In direct support of these findings , the transcriptional profile of Cav-1 ( -/- ) stromal cells overlaps significantly with Alzheimer disease , which is characterized by oxidative stress , NO over-production ( peroxynitrite formation ) , inflammation , hypoxia and mitochondrial dysfunction . We conclude that Cav-1 ( -/- ) deficient mice are a new whole-body animal model for an activated lethal tumor microenvironment , i.e. , " tumor stroma " without the tumor . Since Cav-1 ( -/- ) mice are also an established animal model for profibrotic disease , our current results may have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of scleroderma ( systemic sclerosis ) and pulmonary fibrosis , which are also related to abnormal mesenchymal stem cell function .
INTRODUCTION A subpopulation of cancer cells , tumor-initiating cells , is believed to be the driving force behind tumorigenesis and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy . The persistence of tumor-initiating cells may depend on altered regulation of DNA damage and checkpoint proteins , as well as a reduced propensity to undergo apoptosis or senescence . METHODS To test this hypothesis , we isolated CD24-/low/CD44+ tumor-initiating cells ( as mammospheres ) from MCF-7 breast cancer cells grown in adherent monolayer culture , and carried out a comprehensive comparison of cell death and DNA damage response pathways prior to and after exposure to ionizing radiation in mammospheres and monolayer MCF-7 cells . Single and double-strand break repair was measured by single-cell gel electrophoresis . The latter was also examined by phosphorylation of histone H2AX and formation of 53BP1 and Rad51 foci . Apoptosis was quantified by flow-cytometric analysis of annexin V-binding and senescence was analyzed on the basis of cellular beta-galactosidase activity . We employed the telomeric repeat amplification protocol to quantify telomerase activity . Expression of key DNA repair and cell cycle regulatory proteins was detected and quantified by western blot analysis . RESULTS Our data demonstrate that in comparison to the bulk population of MCF-7 cells ( predominantly CD24+/CD44+ ) , the MCF-7 mammosphere cells benefit from a multifaceted approach to cellular protection relative to that seen in monolayer cells , including a reduced level of reactive oxygen species , a more active DNA single-strand break repair ( SSBR ) pathway , possibly due to a higher level of expression of the key SSBR protein , human AP endonuclease 1 ( Ape1 ) , and a significantly reduced propensity to undergo senescence as a result of increased telomerase activity and a low level of p21 protein expression . No significant difference was seen in the rates of double-strand break repair ( DSBR ) between the two cell types , but DSBR in mammospheres appears to by-pass the need for H2AX phosphorylation . CONCLUSIONS Enhanced survival of MCF-7 tumor-initiating cells in response to ionizing radiation is primarily dependent on an inherent down-regulation of the senescence pathway . Since MCF-7 cells are representative of cancer cells that do not readily undergo apoptosis , consideration of senescence pathways may play a role in targeting stem cells from such tumors .
INTRODUCTION Anterior-gradient 2 ( AGR2 ) is an estrogen-responsive secreted protein . Its upregulation has been well documented in a number of cancers , particularly breast cancer , for which mixed data exist on the prognostic implications of AGR2 expression . Although emerging evidence indicates that AGR2 is associated with poor prognosis , its function and impact on cancer-relevant pathways have not been elucidated in breast cancer . METHODS To investigate the biologic role of AGR2 in breast cancer , AGR2 was transiently knocked down , by using siRNA , in T47 D and ZR-75-1 ( estrogen receptor-alpha ( ER)-positive ) and MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 ( ER-negative ) human breast cancer cell lines . The impact of silencing AGR2 was evaluated in both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth ( soft agar , spheroid ) assays . Cell-cycle profiles in ER-positive cell lines were determined with BrdU incorporation , and cell death was measured with Annexin V , JC-1 , and F7-26 staining . After transiently silencing AGR2 or stimulating with recombinant AGR2 , modulation of key regulators of growth and survival pathways was assessed with Western blot . Combination studies of AGR2 knockdown with the antiestrogens tamoxifen and fulvestrant were carried out and assessed at the level of anchorage-dependent growth inhibition and target modulation ( cyclin D1 , ER ) . RESULTS AGR2 knockdown inhibited growth in anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent assays , with a more-pronounced effect in ER-positive cell lines . Cyclin D1 levels and BrdU incorporation were reduced with AGR2 knockdown . Conversely , cyclin D1 was induced with recombinant AGR2 . AGR2 knockdown induced cell death in ZR-75-1 and T47 D cells , and also downregulated survivin and c-Myc . Evidence of AGR2-ER crosstalk was demonstrated by a reduction of ER at the protein level after transiently silencing AGR2 . AGR2 knockdown in combination with fulvestrant or tamoxifen did not preclude the efficacy of the antiestrogens , but enhanced it . In addition , p-Src , implicated in tamoxifen resistance , was downregulated with AGR2 knockdown . CONCLUSIONS Transiently silencing AGR2 in ER-positive breast cancer cell lines inhibited cell growth and cell-cycle progression and induced cell death . Breast cancer drivers ( ER and cyclin D1 ) as well as cancer-signaling nodes ( pSrc , c-Myc , and survivin ) were demonstrated to be downstream of AGR2 . Collectively , the data presented support the utility of anti-AGR2 therapy in ER-positive breast cancers because of its impact on cancer-relevant pathways .
The deregulation of Met/hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) receptor tyrosine kinase signaling constitutes a common event in colorectal cancers . However , the physiopathological functions of such a deregulation remain poorly understood . In the present study , we investigated the role of the deregulation of Met receptor in the neoplastic transformation of intestinal epithelial cells . To do so , the normal , well-established and characterized rat intestinal epithelial IEC-6 cells were transduced with a retrovirus carrying the oncogenic constitutive active form of Met receptor , Tpr-Met . Herein , we show that compared with control IEC-6 cells , Tpr-Met-IEC-6 cells exhibit enhanced proliferation , loss of growth-contact inhibition , cell morphological alterations , actin cytoskeletal reorganization , loss of E-cadherin expression and anchorage-independent growth . Moreover , Tpr-Met-IEC-6 cells are conferred the capacity to produce the proangiogenic factor VEGF and to reduce the potent antiangiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 . Of significance , Tpr-Met-IEC-6 cells are endowed with the ability to elicit angiogenic responses and to form tumors and metastases in vivo . Hence , our study demonstrates for the first time that the sole oncogenic engagement of Met receptor in normal intestinal epithelial cells is sufficient to induce a wide array of cancerous biological processes that are fundamental to the initiation and malignant progression of colorectal cancers .
Magnetite iron nanoparticles have been widely used as contrast agents and in thermal therapy for cancer . However , their adverse effects on human health have not been fully investigated . In this study , iron oxide nanoparticles were prepared using inorganic iron chloride ( size : 5.3+/-3.6 nm in phosphate buffered saline , surface charge : 23.14 mV ) , and their inflammatory responses were investigated . When mice were treated with iron oxide nanoparticles ( 250 microg/kg , 500 microg/kg , and 1mg/kg ) by a single intratracheal instillation , the level of intracellular reduced glutathione ( GSH ) was decreased in the cells of bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid . The arrest of cell cycles in G1 phase was observed , but S-phase was significantly decreased . The concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1 , TNF-alpha , and IL-6 ) were dose-dependently increased at day 1 after instillation in the BAL fluid and in the blood . During the experimental period of 28 days , pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1 , TNF-alpha , and IL-6 ) , Th0 cytokine ( IL-2 ) , Th1 type cytokine ( IL-12 ) , Th2 type cytokines ( IL-4 and IL-5 ) , TGF-beta , and IgE were also elevated . Expressions of many genes related with inflammation or tissue damage such as heat shock protein , matrix metalloproteinase , tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases , and serum amyloid A were significantly induced . Formation of microgranuloma , which is one of the indicators for chronic inflammatory response , was observed in the alveolar space . In addition , distribution of B cell and CD8+ T cell in blood lymphocytes was increased at day 28 . Based on the result , iron oxide nanoparticles may subchronic induce inflammatory responses via oxidative stress in mice by a single intratracheal instillation .
Contact inhibition is the process by which cells switch from a motile growing state to a passive and stabilized state upon touching their neighbors . When two cells touch , an adhesion link is created between them by means of transmembrane E-cadherin proteins . Simultaneously , their actin filaments stop polymerizing in the direction perpendicular to the membrane and reorganize to create an apical belt that colocalizes with the adhesion links . Here , we propose a detailed quantitative model of the role of cytoplasmic beta-catenin and alpha-catenin proteins in this process , treated as a reaction-diffusion system . Upon cell-cell contact the concentration in alpha-catenin dimers increases , inhibiting actin branching and thereby reducing cellular motility and expansion pressure . This model provides a mechanism for contact inhibition that could explain previously unrelated experimental findings on the role played by E-cadherin , beta-catenin , and alpha-catenin in the cellular phenotype and in tumorigenesis . In particular , we address the effect of a knockout of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene . Potential direct tests of our model are discussed .
Proliferation of non-transformed cells is regulated by cell-cell contacts , which are referred to as contact-inhibition . Vice versa , transformed cells are characterised by a loss of contact-inhibition . Despite its generally accepted importance for cell-cycle control , little is known about the intracellular signalling pathways involved in contact-inhibition . Unravelling the molecular mechanisms of contact-inhibition and its loss during tumourigenesis will be an important step towards the identification of novel target genes in tumour diagnosis and treatment . To better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms we identified the transcriptional programme of contact-inhibition in NIH3T3 fibroblast using high-density microarrays . Setting the cut off : >or=1.5-fold , P <or= 0.05 , 853 genes and 73 cDNA sequences were differentially expressed in confluent compared to exponentially growing cultures . Importing these data into GenMAPP software revealed a comprehensive list of cell-cycle regulatory genes mediating G0/G1 arrest , which was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot . In a narrow analysis ( cut off : >or=2-fold , P <or= 0.002 ) , we found 110 transcripts to be differentially expressed representing 107 genes and 3 cDNA sequences involved , for example , in proliferation , signal transduction , transcriptional regulation , cell adhesion and communication . Interestingly , the majority of genes was upregulated indicating that contact-inhibition is not a passive state , but actively induced . Furthermore , we confirmed differential expression of eight genes by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and identified the potential tumour suppressor transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta)-1-induced clone 22 ( TSC-22 ; tgfb1i4 ) as a novel protein to be induced in contact-inhibited cells .
INTRODUCTION Tamoxifen is the most widely prescribed anti-estrogen treatment for patients with estrogen receptor ( ER)-positive breast cancer . However , there is still a need for biomarkers that reliably predict endocrine sensitivity in breast cancers and these may well be expressed in a dynamic manner . METHODS In this study we assessed gene expression changes at multiple time points ( days 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 14 ) after tamoxifen treatment in the ER-positive ZR-75-1 xenograft model that displays significant changes in apoptosis , proliferation and angiogenesis within 2 days of therapy . RESULTS Hierarchical clustering identified six time-related gene expression patterns , which separated into three groups : two with early/transient responses , two with continuous/late responses and two with variable response patterns . The early/transient response represented reductions in many genes that are involved in cell cycle and proliferation ( e.g . BUB1B , CCNA2 , CDKN3 , MKI67 , UBE2C ) , whereas the continuous/late changed genes represented the more classical estrogen response genes ( e.g . TFF1 , TFF3 , IGFBP5 ) . Genes and the proteins they encode were confirmed to have similar temporal patterns of expression in vitro and in vivo and correlated with reduction in tumour volume in primary breast cancer . The profiles of genes that were most differentially expressed on days 2 , 4 and 7 following treatment were able to predict prognosis , whereas those most changed on days 1 and 14 were not , in four tamoxifen treated datasets representing a total of 404 patients . CONCLUSIONS Both early/transient/proliferation response genes and continuous/late/estrogen-response genes are able to predict prognosis of primary breast tumours in a dynamic manner . Temporal expression of therapy-response genes is clearly an important factor in characterising the response to endocrine therapy in breast tumours which has significant implications for the timing of biopsies in neoadjuvant biomarker studies .
OBJECTIVES Oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory mediators have been implicated in breast carcinogenesis . We attempted to evaluate the markers of oxidative stress , antioxidant mechanism and the inflammatory pathway in patients with breast cancer . METHODS This study was carried out in departments of Biochemistry and Surgery , Maulana Azad Medical College and associated Hospitals , New Delhi , India . A total of 60 cases of carcinoma of the breast and 60 healthy controls were included in the study . The parameters that were assayed include markers of oxidative stress-conjugated dienes , thiobarbitone reactive substances ( TBARS ) , antioxidants-superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) , glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) , glutathione ( GSH ) and markers of inflammation-interleukin-6(IL-6) and ferritin . RESULTS There was a significant decline in the antioxidant levels and a significant rise in oxidant levels in patients with carcinoma of the breast , compared to controls . The inflammatory markers-IL-6 and ferritin-were also significantly higher in patients with breast cancer . A significantly positive correlation was observed between the IL-6 levels and conjugated dienes with the stage of breast carcinoma ; whilst a significantly negative correlation was observed between the levels of conjugated dienes and superoxide dismutase and superoxide dismutase levels with the disease staging . CONCLUSIONS This study underlines the interplay between inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of breast cancer . MINI ABSTRACT : An intense research is underway to identify the possible risk factors and the molecular mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of breast cancer . Inflammation and oxidative stress are two such etiologies investigated in our study .
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) is an endemic malignant disease of the head and neck region with unique features including striking ethnic and geographic variations as well as multifactorial etiology . Previous studies have demonstrated the anticancer properties of genistein , the major soy isoflavonoid , in several human cancer cells such as breast , prostate , colon , gastric , lung , and hepatoma . However , the action of genistein in NPC cells has not been determined . In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effects of genistein on NPC cells and its possible underlying mechanisms . We found that genistein dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of human NPC cell line CNE2 cells . DNA flow cytometric analysis revealed that 30 to 120 microM genistein induced dramatic G2/M phase arrest in NPC cells . The mRNA expression levels , as shown by gene expression array and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction , and the protein expression levels of the cell cycle regulators p21(Cip1) and ATR ( Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related ) were elevated following genistein treatment . Interestingly , we also observed concomitant induction of p15(Ink4b) in genistein induced inhibitory effects in NPC cells . Moreover , selective estrogen receptor modulators did not affect genistein induced growth inhibition . These findings provide new insights into the potential intervention of NPC with genistein .
We have previously demonstrated the antiproliferative effect of two flavonoids-2,2'-dihydroxychalcone ( DHC ) , a novel synthetic flavonoid , and fisetin , a naturally occurring flavonol-in prostate cancer cells . In this study , we further examine the mechanisms of these compounds on survival and proliferation pathways . DHC and fisetin ( 1-50 microM ) caused a dose-dependent reduction in viability , a concomitant increase in apoptosis in PC3 cells at 72 h , and a decrease in clonogenic survival at 24 h treatment . DHC was considerably more potent than fisetin in these cytotoxicity assays . The mechanism of accelerated cellular senescence was not activated by either compound in PC3 or lymph node carcinoma of the prostate ( LNCaP ) cells . Gene expression alterations in PC3 and LNCaP cells treated with 15 muM DHC and 25 microM fisetin for 6 to 24 h were determined by oligonucleotide array . Amongst the most highly represented functional categories of genes altered by both compounds was the cell cycle category . In total , 100 cell cycle genes were altered by DHC and fisetin including 27 genes with key functions in G2/M phase that were downregulated by both compounds . Other functional categories altered included chromosome organization , apoptosis , and stress response . These results demonstrate the multiple mechanisms of antitumor activity of DHC and fisetin in prostate cancer cells in vitro .
In traditional biochemical experiments , the behavior of individual proteins is obscured by ensemble averaging . To better understand the behavior of proteins that bind to and/or translocate on DNA , we have developed instrumentation that uses optical trapping , microfluidic solution delivery , and fluorescent microscopy to visualize either individual proteins or assemblies of proteins acting on single molecules of DNA . The general experimental design involves attaching a single DNA molecule to a polystyrene microsphere that is then used as a microscopic handle to manipulate individual DNA molecules with a laser trap . Visualization is achieved by fluorescently labeling either the DNA or the protein of interest , followed by direct imaging using high-sensitivity fluorescence microscopy . We describe the sample preparation and instrumentation used to visualize the interaction of individual proteins with single molecules of DNA . As examples , we describe the application of these methods to the study of proteins involved in recombination-mediated DNA repair , a process essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity .
UNLABELLED Activation of beta-catenin , the central effector of the canonical Wnt pathway and a recognized oncogene , has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma . We examined N-nitrosodiethylamine ( DEN)-induced tumorigenesis in hepatic beta-catenin conditional knockout mice ( beta-cat KO ) . Male beta-cat KO and age- and sex-matched littermate controls were given a single intraperitoneal DEN injection and followed for 6-12 months for hepatic tumors . Hepatic tumors were characterized for histology , proliferation , apoptosis , oxidative stress , and specific proteins by way of western blot , immunohistochemistry , and coprecipitation studies . For in vivo tumor intervention studies , specific inhibitors were administered intraperitoneally or through drinking water . Intriguingly , beta-cat KO mice showed a paradoxical increase in susceptibility to DEN-induced tumorigenesis . This accelerated tumorigenesis is due to increased injury and inflammation , unrestricted oxidative stress , fibrosis , and compensatory increase in hepatocyte proliferation secondary to platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRalpha)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PIK3CA)/Akt activation and c-Myc overexpression . In vitro suppression of beta-catenin expression in hepatoma cells led to enhanced PDGFRalpha expression , which was abrogated in the presence of nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) inhibitor . Daily treatment of 6-month-old DEN-exposed beta-cat KO with PDGFRalpha inhibitor dramatically reduced tumor numbers and size . Inclusion of N-acetyl-L-cysteine , a known antioxidant and NF-kappaB inhibitor , in the drinking water led to complete abolition of tumorigenesis in DEN-exposed beta-cat KO . CONCLUSION Loss of beta-catenin impairs the liver's ability to counteract DEN-induced oxidative stress and enhances tumorigenesis through PDGFRalpha/PIK3CA/Akt signaling . Blockade of PDGFRalpha or oxidative stress dramatically affects beta-catenin-deficient tumorigenesis . Also , hepatoma cells use PDGFRalpha/PIK3CA signaling as an escape mechanism following beta-catenin suppression , and their sequential suppression profoundly impedes tumor proliferation .
The soluble hexavalent chromium Cr ( VI ) used in industrial welding is an environmental contaminant widely recognized to act as a carcinogen , mutagen and teratogen towards humans and animals . The carcinogenic potential of metals is a major issue in defining human health risk from exposure . In the present investigation , 93 welders and 60 control subjects with similar mean ages , smoking prevalences and alcohol consumption were enrolled for DNA damage analysis in blood leucocytes by Micronucleus assay ( MN ) and the Comet assay . DNA repair inhibition was also analyzed by assessing XPD gene polymorphism . Welders showed a significant increase in micronucleated cells compared to controls with respect to their smoking habits and alcohol consumption , age and years of exposure ( P<0.05 ) . Results indicated that the welders had a larger mean comet tail length than that of the controls ( P<0.05 ) . The current study suggested that chronic occupational exposure to Cr ( VI ) during welding could lead to increased levels of DNA damage and repair inhibition .
AIMS Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines in the kidney . Epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG ) has anti-oxidant , anti-inflammatory , and anti-tumorigenic properties . In this study , we investigated the effects of EGCG on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and potential mechanisms by which it enhances antioxidant activities and resolves inflammation after EGCG treatment during cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity . MAIN METHODS Twenty-eight rats were divided into four groups as control ( group 1 ; no treatment ; n=7 ) , EGCG ( group 2 ; n=7 ) , cisplatin ( group 3 ; n=7 ) or cisplatin and EGCG ( group 4 ; n=7 ) . After 2 days of EGCG treatment at a dose of l00 mg/kg BW , rats were treated with a single i.p. injection of cisplatin ( 7 mg/kg BW ) . On day 12 ( 10days after the cisplatin treatment ) , all rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation . The level of protein was examined by Western blotting . KEY FINDINGS Cisplatin caused a significant decrease in the expression nuclear levels of NF-E2-related factor-2 ( Nrf2 ) , heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) , and an increase in the levels of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB p65 ) and 4-hydroxynonenal ( HNE ) an oxidative stress marker . EGCG supplementation significantly improved the changes associated with cisplatin nephrotoxicity by increasing levels of Nrf-2 and HO-1 , and decreasing levels of NF-kappaB and HNE . Renal activities of antioxidant enzymes ( catalase , superoxide dismutase , glutathione peroxidase ) and glutathione were significantly lower in cisplatin-treated rats compared with control rats , and EGCG treatment significantly increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione ( P<0.001 ) . SIGNIFICANCE The results suggest that Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway may be the primary target for prevention of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by EGCG , and that reduces it inflammation by inhibiting NF-kappaB .
AIMS Currently , testing for mismatch repair deficiency in colorectal cancers is initiated by performing immunohistochemistry with four antibodies ( MLH1 , PMS2 , MSH2 and MSH6 ) . If any one of these stains is negative the tumour is considered microsatellite unstable and , if clinical circumstances warrant it , the patient is offered genetic testing for Lynch's syndrome . Due to the binding properties of the mismatch repair heterodimer complexes , gene mutation and loss of MLH1 and MSH2 invariably result in the degradation of PMS2 and MSH6 , respectively , but the converse is not true . We propose that staining for PMS2 and MSH6 alone will be sufficient to detect all cases of mismatch repair deficiency and should replace routine screening with all four antibodies . METHODS The electronic database of the department of Anatomical Pathology , Royal North Shore Hospital , Sydney , Australia , was searched for all colorectal carcinomas on which a four panel immunohistochemical microsatellite instability screen was performed . An audit of the slides for concordant loss of MLH1-PMS2 and MSH2-MSH6 was then undertaken . Unusual or discordant cases were reviewed and , in some cases , re-stained to confirm the staining pattern . RESULTS Of 344 cases of colorectal cancer which underwent four antibody immunohistochemistry , 104 displayed loss of at least one mismatch repair protein . Of these , 100 showed concordant mismatch repair loss ( i.e. , loss of MLH1 and PMS2 or loss of MSH2 and MSH6 ) . The four discordant cases comprised two single negative cases ( 1 MSH6 negative/MSH2 positive case , 1 PMS2 negative/MLH1 positive ) and two triple negative ( both MLH1/PMS2/MSH6 negative ) . The microsatellite instability ( MSI ) group showed a relatively high median age ( 69.3 years ) due to the departmental policy of testing all cases with possible MSI morphology regardless of age . CONCLUSIONS The sensitivity and specificity of a two panel test comprised of PMS2 and MSH6 , compared to a four panel test , is 100% . No false negatives or positives were identified . We conclude that the two panel test should replace a four panel protocol for immunohistochemical screening for mismatch repair deficiency .
PURPOSE Overproduction of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) intermediates above the functional capability of cellular antioxidants may result in instability of important macromolecules and represents the molecular basis of many diseases including inflammation processes , cardiovascular alterations , cancer etc . The purpose of this study was to determine plasma level of superoxide anion , hydrogen-peroxide and malondialdehyde ( MDA ) as markers of oxidative stress and activities of superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) and glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) as antioxidant enzymes in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) patients . METHODS The study included 29 untreated B-CLL patients in stage A , and 21 in stages B and C , classified according to the Binet system ; 31 healthy volunteers formed the control group . After centrifugation of heparinized peripheral blood , plasma levels of all investigated parameters were determined using spectrophotometric methods . RESULTS Plasma CAT activity was increased in B-CLL patients compared with control subjects ; also , progression of disease was related with significantly higher plasma activity of CAT . Also , B-CLL patients showed significantly higher plasma concentration of MDA compared with controls . No statistically significant differences of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide as well as plasma activity of SOD and GPx between the tested groups were noted . CONCLUSION Increase of CAT activity in B-CLL patients indicates that there is stimulation of the antioxidant enzyme system , while the increase of MDA concentration shows increased lipid peroxidation level . According to these results it could be concluded that an imbalance exists between oxidants and antioxidants in the plasma of B-CLL patients .
AIMS To screen the genes and possible signal transduction pathways with which nucleostemin ( NS ) interacts and explore the mechanism of NS in prostate cancer . METHODS NS-specific short-hairpin RNA expression plasmid was used to downregulate the NS level in PC-3 cells and the changes of cell cycle were studied . After that , oligonucleotide DNA microarray was used to screen the genome changes in PC-3 cells and quantitative real-time PCR was used to further confirm the differentially expressed genes . RESULTS Detection of cell cycle showed a decrease of S stage and an increase of G1 stage after downregulation of NS. 219 differentially expressed genes were found and these genes were involved in cell cycle , cell proliferation , signal transduction , cell apoptosis and cell differentiation , and so on . Genes related to cell cycle were discussed emphatically . INK4 family genes ( P15 , P16 , P18 ) were upregulated while cyclin D1 HDAC1 were downregulated . These genes were tightly related to CDK4/6-cyclin D and pRb-E2F1 complexes . CONCLUSION NS is an important G1/S checkpoint regulator and it could regulate cell cycles via a p53-independent pathway in prostate cancer .
The NOTCH signaling pathway plays important role in the development of multicellular organisms , as it regulates cell proliferation , survival , and differentiation . In adults , it is essential for the T- or B-lymphocyte lineage commitment . NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations both lead the activation of the NOTCH1 pathway and are found in the majority of T-ALL patients . In this study , the mutation analysis of NOTCH1 and FBXW7 genes was performed in 87 pediatric T-ALLs who were treated on the ALL-BFM protocols . In 19 patients ( 22% ) , activating NOTCH1 mutations were observed either in the heterodimerization domain or in the PEST domain and 7 cases ( 10% ) demonstrated FBXW7 mutations ( 2 cases had both NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations ) . We also analyzed the relationship of the mutation data between the clinical and biological data of the patients . NOTCH1 and FBXW7 , NOTCH1 alone were found correlated with lower initial leucocyte counts which was independent from the sex and T- cell immunophenotype . However , NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations were not predictive of outcome in the overall cohort of pediatric T-ALLs .
BACKGROUND The most deadly form of cancer is not lung or colon , breast or prostate ; it is any cancer that has become metastatic . Mortality due to metastatic melanoma , one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers , has increased steadily over the last several decades . Unfortunately , the arsenal of chemotherapeutic agents available today is most often unsuccessful at extending and improving the life expectancy of afflicted individuals . We sought to identify an effective and nontoxic agent against metastatic melanoma . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We chose to study Cloudman S-91 mouse melanoma cells ( sub-clone M3 , CCL53.1 ) because these cells are highly aggressive and metastatic , representing one of the deadliest types of cancer . Melanoma cells also had an experimental advantage because their morphology , which is easily monitored , relates to the physiology of metastatic cells and normal melanocytes . We chose to test methyl sulfone as a chemotherapeutic agent for two reasons . Because of its chemical structure , we speculated a potential anti-cancer activity by targeting microtubules . Equally important , methyl sulfone has a well-established safety profile in humans . Surprisingly , we found that malignant melanoma cells exposed to methyl sulfone demonstrated the loss of phenotypes characteristic of malignant cells , and the reemergence of phenotypes characteristic of healthy melanocytes . Briefly , over time methyl sulfone induced contact inhibition , loss of ability to migrate through an extracellular matrix , loss of anchorage-independent growth , proper wound healing followed by contact inhibition , irreversible senescence followed by arborization with melanosomes in arbors as seen in normal melanocytes . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Methyl sulfone may have clinical potential as a non-toxic agent effective against metastatic melanoma . Additionally , methyl sulfone has promise as a tool to explore molecular mechanisms of metastatic transformation as well as fundamental processes such as cell migration , contact inhibition , wound healing and cellular senescence .
BACKGROUND/AIMS by reducing the number of ATP molecules produced via aerobic glycolysis , the inhibition of lactic dehydrogenase ( LDH ) should hinder the growth of neoplastic cells without damaging the normal cells which do not rely on this metabolic pathway for their energetic needs . Here , we studied the effect of oxamic and tartronic acids , 2 inhibitors of LDH , on aerobic glycolysis and cell replication of HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells , 2 lines from human hepatocellular carcinomas . METHODS aerobic glycolysis was measured by calculating the amounts of lactic acid formed . The effect on replication was assessed by culturing the cells in both standard conditions and glucose-deprived medium , which was used to shut down aerobic glycolysis . RESULTS the oxamic and tartronic acids inhibited aerobic glycolysis , impaired the growth of both cell lines and also induced an increased expression of p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis , a signal of cell death . A strong impairment of cell replication by oxamic acid was only found when the cells were cultured in the presence of glucose , indicating that it was for the most part owing to inhibition of aerobic glycolysis . CONCLUSIONS inhibition of aerobic glycolysis achieved by blocking LDH could be useful in the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinomas . Without interfering with glucose metabolism in normal cells , it could hinder cell growth by itself and could also enhance the chemotherapeutic index of associated anticancer agents by decreasing the levels of ATP selectively in neoplastic cells .
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA-damage-induced responses are reported frequently to be a risk factor in various cancer types . Here we analysed polymorphisms in 5 genes involved in DNA repair ( XPD Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln , XRCC1 Arg399Gln , APE1 Asp148Glu , NBS1 Glu185Gln , and XPA G-4A ) and in a gene involved in regulation of the cell-cycle ( CCND1 A870G ) . We compared their frequencies in groups of colon , head and neck , and breast cancer patients , and 2 healthy control groups : ( 1 ) matched healthy Polish individuals and ( 2 ) a NCBI database control group . Highly significant differences in the distribution of genotypes of the APE1 , XRCC1 and CCND1 genes were found between colon cancer patients and healthy individuals . The 148Asp APE1 allele and the 399Gln XRCC1 allele apparently increased the risk of colon cancer ( OR = 1.9-2.3 and OR = 1.5-2.1 , respectively ) . Additionally , frequencies of XPD genotypes differed between healthy controls and patients with colon or head and neck cancer . Importantly , no differences in the distribution of these polymorphisms were found between healthy controls and breast cancer patients . The data clearly indicate that the risk of colon cancer is associated with single-nucleotide polymorphism in genes involved in base-excision repair and DNA-damage-induced responses .
BACKGROUND In this report , we explored the role of PKCalpha and PKCe as mediators of phorbol 12-myristate13-acetate ( PMA)-induced proliferation in pituitary tumor GH3B6 cells , and determined if the ERK1/2 and Akt pathways were activated . METHODS The GH3B6 cell proliferation was estimated by BrdU incorporation and the cell cycle progression by flow cytometric cell cycle analysis . We determined the expression of PKCalpha and PKCe in membrane and cytosolic fractions by western blotting . The subcellular redistribution of both PKC isozymes was analyzed by confocal microscopy . RESULTS Incubation with PMA for 15 min stimulated PKCalpha and PKCe activation , which was correlated with the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but not Akt . The activation of both these PKC isozymes was closely associated with the stimulation of proliferation and the cell cycle progression induced by PMA in GH3B6 cells , an effect that was blocked by the inhibitors of PKCalpha ( Go6976 ) and PKCe ( eV1-2 ) . In addition , the pretreatment with the inhibitor of ERK1/2 ( PD98059 ) prevented the mitogenic activity induced by treatment with PMA for 15 min . CONCLUSION We demonstrated that the activation of PKCalpha and PKCe by phorbol ester in tumor pituitary GH3B6 cells led to cell proliferation and cell cycle progression , effects that involved ERK1/2 activation .
The NF-kappaB is best known for its role in inflammation . Here we show that constitutive NF-kappaB activity in cancer cells promotes the biosynthesis of redox scavenger glutathione ( GSH ) , which in turn confers resistance to oxidative stress . Inhibition of NF-kappaB significantly decreases GSH in several lines of human leukemia and prostate cancer cells possessing high or moderate NF-kappaB activities . Concomitantly , NF-kappaB inhibition by pharmacological and molecular means sensitizes " NF-kappaB positive " cancer cells to chemically-induced oxidative stress and death . We propose that inhibition of NF-kappaB can reduce intracellular GSH in " NF-kappaB-positive " cancers thereby improving the efficacy of oxidative stress-based anti-cancer therapy .
Maintaining the integrity of the cell cycle is critical for ensuring that cells only undergo DNA replication and proliferation under controlled conditions in response to discrete stimuli . One mechanism by which the fidelity of this process is guaranteed is through the activation of cell cycle checkpoints . The mitotic spindle checkpoint , which is regulated by Aurora B kinase , ensures proper kinetochore attachment to chromosomes leading to equal distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells . We demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) cascade regulates mitotic progression and the spindle checkpoint . As demonstrated by immunofluorescence at kinetochores , depletion of Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein ( RKIP ) , an inhibitor of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling , causes an increase in MAPK activity that inhibits Aurora B kinase activity . By monitoring mitotic index and transit time from nuclear envelope breakdown to anaphase , we demonstrated that RKIP depletion leads to a defective spindle checkpoint and genomic instability , particularly in response to drugs that disrupt microtubule function .
Verbascum thapsus commonly known as ' mullein ' is part of a large family of Scrophulariaceae consisting of more than 360 species . From antiquity Verbascum thapsus has been used as a medicinal herb , it contains diverse polysaccharides , iroid glycosides , flavonoids , saponins , volatile oils and phenylentanoids . Inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) represents one of the three isoforms that produce nitric oxide using L-arginine as a substrate in response to an increase in superoxide anion activated by NF-kB . It is implicated in different pathophysiological events and its expression increases greatly during an inflammatory process , due to oxidative stress and the activation of the enzymes of the antioxidant network such as SOD , CAT and GPx.In this study an inflammatory state was reproduced by treating THP-1 cells ( human myelomonocytic leukaemia ) with pro-inflammatory stimuli , such as LPS and IFN-gamma , obtaining an up-regulation both in the expression and in the activity of iNOS . The aim of the work was to investigate the antiinflammatory action of verbascoside using a concentration of 100 mum . The results show a significant decrease of the expression and activity of iNOS , extracellular O(2) ( - ) production , SOD , CAT and GPx activity when the cells were treated with verbascoside . Based on these results it is hypothesized that verbascoside has antiinflammatory properties since it reduces the production of superoxide radicals and consequently reduces the activity of iNOS .
BACKGROUND Oxidative stress and inflammation are important steps in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis . We postulated that therapeutic concentrations of aspirin and pravastatin , especially in combination , may suppress oxidative stress and inflammation in endothelial cells , and this concept was examined in human coronary artery endothelial cells ( HCAECs ) . METHODS Human coronary artery endothelial cells were cultured and treated with oxidized-low density lipoprotein ( ox-LDL , 60 microg/ml for 24 hours ) alone , or pre-treated with aspirin ( 1 , 2 or 5 mmol/L ) , pravastatin ( 1 , 5 or 10 micromol/L ) or their combination ( 1 mmol/L aspirin and 5 micromol/L pravastatin ) , followed by ox-LDL treatment . After respective treatment , superoxide anion production , p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and transcription factor NF-kappaB activation , protein expression of lectin-like ox-LDL receptor-1 ( LOX-1 ) and adhesion molecules , and monocyte adhesion were measured . RESULTS Ox-LDL treatment greatly elicited its receptor LOX-1 expression , superoxide anion production and inflammatory response , which were minimally affected by low concentration of aspirin ( 1 mmol/L ) or pravastatin ( 5 micromol/L ) , but were markedly decreased by their combination . Activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and NF-kappaB , the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 , which were only mildly affected by aspirin or pravastatin alone , were significantly attenuated by their combination . As a consequence , monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells was markedly attenuated by the combination of the two agents . Well-known anti-oxidants alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol had similar inhibitory effects on ox-LDL-mediated oxidative stress and LOX-1 expression as well as monocyte adhesion as did the combination of aspirin and pravastatin . CONCLUSIONS These studies point to a positive interaction between aspirin and pravastatin with regard to endothelial biology . Anti-oxidant and subsequent anti-inflammatory effect may be one of the potential underling mechanisms .
Application of adenovirus vectors ( Adv ) in metastatic cancer treatment is limited . We previously demonstrated that covalent conjugation of polyethleneglycol ( PEG ) to Adv enhances therapeutic effects and decreases toxic side-effects after systemic administration , but the level of immune response to PEGylated Adv ( PEG-Ad ) was not examined . Here , we examined the effect of PEGylation of Adv on the production of anti-Adv antibodies and antitumor response . We constructed a set of PEG-Ad using 5-kDa PEG , with modification rates of 30% , 45% and 90% . After systemic administration of Advs to rats , we examined the level of anti-Adv immunoglobulin ( Ig)G and IgM in serum . The levels of anti-Adv IgG and anti-Adv IgM in rats treated with unmodified Adv were higher than those in control group . Rats treated with PEG-Ad that had a 90% modification rate showed lower level of anti-Adv IgG and anti-Adv IgM than those treated with unmodified Adv , whereas rats treated with PEG-Ad that had a 30% or 45% modification rate showed a similar level of anti-Adv IgG and IgM to those treated with unmodified Adv. Systemic administration of PEG-Ad that had a 90% modification rate , and expressed tumor necrosis factor-alpha , significantly reduced the number of metastatic colonies in the lung compared to unmodified Adv , with negligible side effects . These results suggest that systemic administration of PEG-Ad with an appropriate PEG modification rate has the potential to reduce the production of antibodies against Adv and increase the therapeutic response against metastatic cancer .
Progression of breast cancer is associated with remodeling of the extracellular matrix , often involving a switch from estrogen dependence to a dependence on EGF receptor ( EGFR)/HER-2 and is accompanied by increased expression of the main binding protein for insulin-like growth factors ( IGFBP-3 ) . We have examined the effects of IGFBP-3 on EGF responses of breast epithelial cells in the context of changes in the extracellular matrix . On plastic and laminin with MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells , EGF and IGFBP-3 each increased cell growth and together produced a synergistic response , whereas with T47D breast cancer cells IGFBP-3 alone had no effect , but the ability of EGF to increase cell proliferation was markedly inhibited in the presence of IGFBP-3 . In contrast on fibronectin with MCF-10A cells , IGFBP-3 alone inhibited cell growth and blocked EGF-induced proliferation . With the cancer cells , IGFBP-3 alone had no effect but enhanced the EGF-induced increase in cell growth . The insulin-like growth factor-independent effects of IGFBP-3 alone on cell proliferation were completely abrogated in the presence of an EGFR , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , Iressa . Although IGFBP-3 did not affect EGFR phosphorylation [ Tyr(1068) ] , it was found to modulate receptor internalization and was associated with activation of Rho and subsequent changes in MAPK phosphorylation . The levels of fibronectin and IGFBP-3 within breast tumors may determine their dependence on EGFR and their response to therapies targeting this receptor .
The AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun is essential for cellular proliferation in many cell types , but the molecular link between growth factors and c-Jun activation has been enigmatic . In this study we identify a previously uncharacterized RING-domain-containing protein , RACO-1 ( RING domain AP-1 co-activator-1 ) , as a c-Jun co-activator that is regulated by growth factor signalling . RACO-1 interacted with c-Jun independently of amino-terminal phosphorylation , and was both necessary and sufficient for c-Jun/AP-1 activation . Growth factor-mediated stimulation of AP-1 was attributable to MEK/ERK-dependent stabilization of RACO-1 protein . Stimulation of the MEK/ERK pathway strongly promoted Lys 63-linked ubiquitylation of RACO-1 , which antagonized Lys 48-linked degradative auto-ubiquitylation of the same Lys residues . RACO-1 depletion reduced cellular proliferation and decreased expression of several growth-associated AP-1 target genes , such as cdc2 , cyclinD1 and hb-egf . Moreover , transgenic overexpression of RACO-1 augmented intestinal tumour formation triggered by aberrant Wnt signalling and cooperated with oncogenic Ras in colonic hyperproliferation . Thus RACO-1 is a co-activator that links c-Jun to growth factor signalling and is essential for AP-1 function in proliferation .
Cytokeratin ( CK ) 19-positive hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) has been reported to have a poor prognosis . The mechanism of the development of CK19-positive HCC remains to be studied . To clarify this , in vitro experiments were performed using human HCC cell lines ( PLC-5 , HepG2 ) , and the phenotypic changes after stimulation with several growth factors were examined using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR , western blotting , and immunofluorescence staining . In vivo experiments using human HCC specimens obtained from a total of 78 patients and clinicopathological analysis were also performed . Among the growth factors tested , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) had prominent effects on inducing CK19 expression in PLC-5 and HepG2 , which was accompanied by the reduced expression of alpha-fetoprotein in PLC-5 . The induction of CK19 expression after EGF stimulation was accompanied by the phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase ( JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase , which was blocked by the addition of JNK inhibitors . EGF also increased proliferative abilities and invasive properties of the HCC cell lines . In vivo , 9 ( 12% ) of 78 HCC cases showed positive immunohistochemical staining of CK19 . The extent of positive immunohistochemical signals of EGF , EGF receptor ( EGFR ) , and JNK expression was significantly intense in CK-19-positive HCC than those of CK19-negative HCC . Clinicopathological analysis showed that CK19-positive HCC had a high incidence of portal vein invasion , extrahepatic metastasis and an early relapse , which was associated with the worsened 2-year disease free survival . These results indicate that the activation of the EGF-EGFR signaling pathway is associated with the development of CK19-positive HCC , and the EGF-induced increase in growth abilities of HCC may account for the poor prognosis of the patients .
Unlike the growth factor dependence of normal cells , cancer cells can maintain growth factor-independent glycolysis and survival through expression of oncogenic kinases , such as BCR-Abl . Although targeted kinase inhibition can promote cancer cell death , therapeutic resistance develops frequently , and further mechanistic understanding is needed . Cell metabolism may be central to this cell death pathway , as we have shown that growth factor deprivation leads to decreased glycolysis that promotes apoptosis via p53 activation and induction of the proapoptotic protein Puma . Here , we extend these findings to show that elevated glucose metabolism , characteristic of cancer cells , can suppress protein kinase Cdelta ( PKCdelta)-dependent p53 activation to maintain cell survival after growth factor withdrawal . In contrast , DNA damage-induced p53 activation was PKCdelta independent and was not metabolically sensitive . Both stresses required p53 Ser(18) phosphorylation for maximal activity but led to unique patterns of p53 target gene expression , showing distinct activation and response pathways for p53 that were differentially regulated by metabolism . Consistent with oncogenic kinases acting to replace growth factors , treatment of BCR-Abl-expressing cells with the kinase inhibitor imatinib led to reduced metabolism and p53- and Puma-dependent cell death . Accordingly , maintenance of glucose uptake inhibited p53 activation and promoted imatinib resistance . Furthermore , inhibition of glycolysis enhanced imatinib sensitivity in BCR-Abl-expressing cells with wild-type p53 but had little effect on p53-null cells . These data show that distinct pathways regulate p53 after DNA damage and metabolic stress and that inhibiting glucose metabolism may enhance the efficacy of and overcome resistance to targeted molecular cancer therapies .
OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between plasma levels of insulin-like growth factors-1 ( IGF-1 ) and IGF-binding protein-3 ( IGFBP-3 ) and the risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) and cervical cancer . METHODS Plasma levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 of 44 cervical cancer patients , 82 CIN patients and 40 neoplasm-free patients were investigated . Then the associations of the plasma levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 with cervical neoplasm or its clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed . RESULTS The mean IGF-1 concentrations were significantly different among the control , CIN , and cervical cancer groups ; the levels were higher in the CIN group compared to the controls . According to the quartile category , the plasma IGF-1 level was significantly higher ( p=0.0015 ) in the CIN group than in the controls . The IGFBP-3 level showed no association between the controls and CIN groups ( p=0.842 ) . Although the mean IGF-1/IGFBP-3 molar ratio had borderline significance ( p=0.08 ) among the study population , the quartile comparison showed a significantly higher IGF-1/IGFBP-3 molar ratio in the CIN group compared to the control group ( p=0.041 ) . CONCLUSION Plasma levels of IGF-1 and the IGF-1/IGFBP-3 molar ratio might be useful for the development early detection of cervical lesions and used as an adjuvant diagnostic tool for cervical neoplasia after more larger scale research .
BACKGROUND Apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 ( ASPP ) family members can stimulate the apoptotic function of p53 but have no impact on its cell cycle arrest function . MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression pattern of the ASPP family consisting of ASPP1 , ASPP2 , and iASPP was examined by immunohistochemistry in 45 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma ( EEA ) specimens and 26 normal endometrial tissue ( NET ) samples . RESULTS The expression rates of ASPP1 and ASPP2 in EEA were significantly lower than those in NET ( p < 0.05 ) . However , the iASPP expression rate in EEA was statistically higher in contrast to NET ( p < 0.05 ) . Expression of ASPP1 and iASPP in EEA had no correlation with any clinicopathological features ( p > 0.05). iASPP was associated with grade , invasion , and lymph node metastasis ( p < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS It is a novel finding that the expression pattern of the ASPP family members has respective pathological and clinical implications in EEA , and iASPP might be a candidate target for EEA therapy .
Reciprocity of inflammation , oxidative stress and neovascularization is emerging as an important mechanism underlying numerous processes from tissue healing and remodelling to cancer progression . Whereas the mechanism of hypoxia-driven angiogenesis is well understood , the link between inflammation-induced oxidation and de novo blood vessel growth remains obscure . Here we show that the end products of lipid oxidation , omega-(2-carboxyethyl)pyrrole ( CEP ) and other related pyrroles , are generated during inflammation and wound healing and accumulate at high levels in ageing tissues in mice and in highly vascularized tumours in both murine and human melanoma . The molecular patterns of carboxyalkylpyrroles are recognized by Toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) , but not TLR4 or scavenger receptors on endothelial cells , leading to an angiogenic response that is independent of vascular endothelial growth factor . CEP promoted angiogenesis in hindlimb ischaemia and wound healing models through MyD88-dependent TLR2 signalling . Neutralization of endogenous carboxyalkylpyrroles impaired wound healing and tissue revascularization and diminished tumour angiogenesis . Both TLR2 and MyD88 are required for CEP-induced stimulation of Rac1 and endothelial migration . Taken together , these findings establish a new function of TLR2 as a sensor of oxidation-associated molecular patterns , providing a key link connecting inflammation , oxidative stress , innate immunity and angiogenesis .
BACKGROUND Human Barrett's cancer cell lines have numerous , poorly-characterized genetic abnormalities and , consequently , those lines have limited utility as models for studying the early molecular events in carcinogenesis . Cell lines with well-defined genetic lesions that recapitulate various stages of neoplastic progression in Barrett's esophagus would be most useful for such studies . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS To develop such model cell lines , we started with telomerase-immortalized , non-neoplastic Barrett's epithelial ( BAR-T ) cells , which are spontaneously deficient in p16 , and proceeded to knock down p53 using RNAi , to activate Ras by introducing oncogenic H-Ras(G12V) , or both . BAR-T cells infected with either p53 RNAi or oncogenic H-Ras(G12V) alone maintained cell-to-cell contact inhibition and did not exhibit anchorage-independent growth in soft agar . In contrast , the combination of p53 RNAi knockdown with expression of oncogenic H-Ras(G12V) transformed the p16-deficient BAR-T cells , as evidenced by their loss of contact inhibition , by their formation of colonies in soft agar , and by their generation of tumors in immunodeficient mice . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Through these experiments , we have generated a number of transformed and non-transformed cell lines with well-characterized genetic abnormalities recapitulating various stages of carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus . These lines should be useful models for the study of carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus , and for testing the efficacy of chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents .
Base analogs are powerful antimetabolites and dangerous mutagens generated endogenously by oxidative stress , inflammation , and aberrant nucleotide biosynthesis . Human inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase ( ITPA ) hydrolyzes triphosphates of noncanonical purine bases ( i.e. , ITP , dITP , XTP , dXTP , or their mimic : 6-hydroxyaminopurine ( HAP ) deoxynucleoside triphosphate ) and thus regulates nucleotide pools and protects cells from DNA damage . We demonstrate that the model purine base analog HAP induces DNA breaks in human cells and leads to elevation of levels of ITPA . A human polymorphic allele of the ITPA , 94C->A encodes for the enzyme with a P32T amino-acid change and leads to accumulation of nonhydrolyzed ITP . The polymorphism has been associated with adverse reaction to purine base-analog drugs . The level of both spontaneous and HAP-induced DNA breaks is elevated in the cell line with the ITPA P32T variant . The results suggested that human ITPA plays a pivotal role in the protection of DNA from noncanonical purine base analogs .
A growing number of studies have demonstrated an association between serum levels of insulin-like growth factors ( IGFs ) and IGF binding protein-3 ( IGFBP-3 ) and increased risk for various cancers . The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between levels of IGF-II or IGFBP-3 in cervical scrapes with cervical cancer and precancerous lesions : low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( LSIL ) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL). 4 groups of cases were examined : LSIL ( n=20 ) , HSIL ( n=28 ) , cervical cancer ( n=45 ) , and controls ( n=51 ) . Control subjects were women with normal , HPV DNA-negative Papanicolau ( Pap ) test . IGF-II and IGFBP-3 levels in cervical scrapes were measured by ELISA . Results show that median protein levels of IGF-II were significantly lower in cervical cancer cases vs. controls ( 446.5 ng/mg vs. 1,168.6 ng/mg , p<0.001 ) . Significantly higher values of IGFBP-3 were found in HSIL vs. controls ( median : 549.5 ng/mg vs. 216 ng/mg ; p=0.018 ) , and were not affected by HR HPV infection , meanwhile no significant differences were observed in IGFBP-3 levels between LSIL or cervical cancer as compared to controls . These data suggests that the progression to cervical cancer is associated with alterations in the IGF system and not affected by HR HPV infection . More studies are needed to understand the possible role of IGFBP-3 in cervical carcinogenesis .
Mode of action ( MOA ) analysis provides a systematic description of key events leading to adverse health effects in animal bioassays for the purpose of informing human health risk assessment . Uncertainties and data gaps identified in the MOA analysis may also be used to guide future research to improve understanding of the MOAs underlying a specific toxic response and foster development of toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic models . An MOA analysis , consistent with approaches outlined in the MOA Framework as described in the Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment , was conducted to evaluate small intestinal tumors observed in mice chronically exposed to relatively high concentrations of hexavalent chromium ( Cr(VI) ) in drinking water . Based on review of the literature , key events in the MOA are hypothesized to include saturation of the reductive capacity of the upper gastrointestinal tract , absorption of Cr(VI) into the intestinal epithelium , oxidative stress and inflammation , cell proliferation , direct and/or indirect DNA modification , and mutagenesis . Although available data generally support the plausibility of these key events , several unresolved questions and data gaps were identified , highlighting the need for obtaining critical toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic data in the target tissue and in the low-dose range . Experimental assays that can address these data gaps are discussed along with strategies for comparisons between responsive and nonresponsive tissues and species . This analysis provides a practical application of MOA Framework guidance and is instructive for the design of studies to improve upon the information available for quantitative risk assessment .
Histone deacetylase inhibitors induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells and are , therefore , promising anti-cancer drugs . The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is activated in histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor-treated tumor cells , and its growth-inhibitory function contributes to the anti-tumorigenic effect of HDAC inhibitors . We show here that induction of p21 by trichostatin A involves MAP kinase signaling . Activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway by growth factors or stress signals results in histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation at the p21 promoter and is crucial for acetylation of the neighboring lysine 14 and recruitment of activated RNA polymerase II in response to trichostatin A treatment . In non-induced cells , the protein phosphatase PP2A is associated with the p21 gene and counteracts its activation . Induction of p21 is linked to simultaneous acetylation and phosphorylation of histone H3 . The dual modification mark H3S10phK14ac at the activated p21 promoter is recognized by the phospho-binding protein 14-3-3zeta , which protects the phosphoacetylation mark from being processed by PP2A . Taken together we have revealed a cross-talk of reversible phosphorylation and acetylation signals that controls the activation of p21 by HDAC inhibitors and identify the phosphatase PP2A as chromatin-associated transcriptional repressor in mammalian cells .
Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 ( Stat3 ) is activated by cytokines and growth factors in lung cancers and regulates expression of genes implicated in cell growth , survival , and transformation . Previously , we found that mice with a deletion of the G protein-coupled receptor , family C , group 5 , member a ( Gprc5a ) gene develop lung tumors , indicating that Gprc5a is a tumor suppressor . Herein , we show that epithelial cells from Gprc5a knockout mouse lung ( Gprc5a(-/-) cells ) survive better in vitro in medium deprived of exogenous growth factors and form more colonies in semisolid medium than their counterparts from wild-type mice ( Gprc5a(+/+) cells ) . Stat3 tyrosine 705 phosphorylation and expression of several Stat3-regulated antiapoptotic genes were higher in Gprc5a(-/-) than in Gprc5a(+/+) cells . Both cell types secreted leukemia inhibitory factor ( Lif ) ; however , whereas Stat3 activation was persistent in Gprc5a(-/-) cells , it was transient in Gprc5a(+/+) cells . Lung adenocarcinoma cells isolated from Gprc5a(-/-) mice also exhibited autocrine Lif-mediated Stat3 activation . The level of Socs3 , the endogenous Stat3 inhibitory protein , was higher in Gprc5a(+/+) than in Gprc5a(-/-) cells , and expression of the tumor suppressor stabilized Socs3 . Inhibition of Stat3 signaling in Gprc5a(-/-) normal and cancer cells by the Janus-activated kinase 2 inhibitor AG490 or by a dominant negative Stat3(Y705F) increased starvation-induced apoptosis and inhibited colony formation . These results show that persistent Stat3 activation is important for the survival and transformation of Gprc5a(-/-) lung cells and suggest that the tumor suppressive effects of Gprc5a are mediated , at least in part , by inhibition of Stat3 signaling through Socs3 stabilization .
INTRODUCTION The insulin-like growth factor I receptor ( IGF-IR ) pathway plays a major role in cancer growth , tumor cell survival and resistance to therapy . BACKGROUND Preclinical evidence that targeting the IGF-IR is effective in cancer treatment has been accumulating for almost 2 decades . Early clinical trials revealed an acceptable safety profile together with pharmacodynamic evidence that the receptor can be targeted successfully . It is premature to draw conclusions regarding the therapeutic potential of this class of compounds but well-documented single-agent activity was noted during phase I evaluations , and recent evidence from a phase-II study suggests that co-administration of an anti-IGF-1R antibody with chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) improves objective response rate and progression-free survival . VIEWPOINTS These early results are a strong indication for continued research on the targeting of IGF-R , particularly in the treatment of NSCLC . CONCLUSIONS Today , IGF-1R targeting appears a promising approach , more than two dozen compounds have been developed and clinical trials are underway .
BACKGROUND/AIMS We investigated whether the anticancer drug Ukrain ( UK ) is able to modulate the expression of some of the key markers of tumor progression in pancreatic cell carcinoma , in order to assess its potential therapeutic effect . METHODS Three cell lines ( HPAF-II , PL45 , HPAC ) were treated with UK ( 5 , 10 and 20 muM ) for 48 h , or left untreated . Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine ( SPARC ) mRNA levels were assessed by real-time PCR . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP)-2 and -9 activity was analyzed by SDS zymography ; SPARC protein levels in cell lysates and supernatants were determined by Western blot . Cell cycle was determined by flow cytometric analysis , and invasion by matrigel invasion assay . RESULTS UK down-regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 , suggesting that UK may decrease pancreatic cancer cell invasion , as confirmed by the matrigel invasion assay . SPARC protein down-regulation in supernatants points to an inhibition by UK of extracellular matrix remodeling in the tumor microenvironment . At the same time , SPARC mRNA and cellular protein level up-regulation suggests that UK can affect cell proliferation by cell cycle inhibition , showing a cell cycle G2/M arrest in UK-treated cells . CONCLUSION Our results suggest that UK modulates two major aspects involved in tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer cells , such as extracellular matrix remodeling and cell proliferation .
Levels of regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) are increased in different cancer types as well as in inflammatory diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis . Treg accumulation may result from aberrant proliferation and trafficking as well as greater resilience to oxidative stress compared with conventional T cells . This enhanced antioxidative capacity of Tregs possibly serves as feedback inhibition during inflammation and prevents uncontrolled immune reactions by favoring survival of suppressor rather than effector cells . In this study , we demonstrate that human Tregs express and secrete higher levels of thioredoxin-1 , a major antioxidative molecule . Thioredoxin-1 has an essential role in maintaining their surface thiol density as the first line of antioxidative defense mechanisms and is sensitive to proinflammatory stimuli , mainly tumor necrosis factor-alpha , in a nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent fashion . The antiapoptotic and oncogenic potential of ( secreted ) Trx-1 suggests that it may exert effects in Tregs beyond redox regulation .
OBJECTIVE Chronic generation of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species are implicated in atherosclerosis , aging , cancers , and other chronic diseases . We hypothesized that zinc induces A20 in premonocytic , endothelial , and cancer cells , and A20 binds to tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)-receptor associated factor , and inhibits Ikappa kinase-alpha ( IKK-alpha)/nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , resulting in downregulation of TNF-alpha and interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) . METHODS To test this hypothesis , we used HL-60 , human umbilical vein endothelial cells , and SW480 cell lines under zinc-deficient and zinc-sufficient conditions in this study . We measured oxidative stress markers , inflammatory cytokines , A20 protein and mRNA , A20-FRAF-1 complex , and IKK-alpha/NF-kappaB signaling in stimulated zinc-deficient and zinc sufficient cells . We also conducted antisense A20 and siRNA studies to investigate the regulatory role of zinc in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta via A20 . RESULTS We found that zinc increased A20 and A20-tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated factor-1 complex , decreased the IKK-alpha/NF-kappaB signaling pathway , oxidative stress markers , and inflammatory cytokines in these cells compared with zinc-deficient cells . We confirmed that zinc-induced A20 contributes to downregulation of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta by antisense and short interfering RNA A20 studies . CONCLUSION Our studies suggest that zinc suppresses generation of NF-kappaB-regulated inflammatory cytokines by induction of A20 .
Several studies have indicated that the cell-surface expressed nucleolin is implicated in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis , and represents an important target for cancer therapy . Here we show that treatment of rhabdoid tumor derived G401 cells with a nucleolin antagonist , the HB-19 pseudopeptide , could restore contact inhibition , impair anchorage-independent growth , and suppress tumor development in nude mice . G401 cells grow without contact inhibition , which is an in vitro characteristic property of malignant tumor cells . At concentrations of HB-19 that does not affect cell viability and multiplication index , there is restoration of contact inhibition thus suggesting that HB-19 treatment causes reversion of the malignant phenotype . Accordingly , HB-19 pretreated G401 cells lose the capacity to form colonies in soft agar . When assayed for tumorigenicity in nude mice , only 50% of mice injected with HB-19 pretreated G401 cells developed tumors with the mean tumor weight of 0.32 g , compared to 100% of mice injected with control G401 cells with the mean tumor weight of 2.36 g . Interestingly , the restoration of contact inhibition in HB-19 treated G401 cells is concomitant with marked reduction of transcripts coding the Wilms ' tumor 1 gene , matrix metalloproteinase-2 , epithelial isoform of CD44 , and vascular endothelial growth factor , whereas no apparent modification is detected for transcripts coding the proto-oncogene c-Myc , anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 , pro-apoptotic Bax , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP-1 , angiogenesis inhibitor TSP-1 , and growth factor Midkine . These findings indicate that the molecular mechanism of action of HB-19 on such highly malignant rhabdoid tumor cells is associated with a selective inhibitory effect on the expression of genes implicated in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis .
Cancer development is associated with genetic instability . Identification of specific loci altered during carcinogenesis in a particular tissue gives scope for early detection and predicting the progressive nature of the tissue pathology . Instability at microsatellite loci is widely attributed to mismatch repair errors due to epigenetic alterations . Using three dinucleotide markers , D3S1313 , D9S171 , D17S250 and two mononucleotide markers BAT25 , BATRII , we evaluated MSI in 97 cases enrolled for endoscopy of upper GI tract with symptoms of dyspepsia , reflux or dysphagia . We aimed at evaluating markers that reflect instability in esophageal malignancies , examine the prevalence of MSI in cancers and other pathologies of the esophagus , and determine the methylation status of hMLH1 gene in relation to MSI. 42% ( 21/50 ) cancers and 15.4%(2/13) precancers exhibited MSI where 85.7% cancers and 50% precancers with MSI , showed a hypermethylated hMLH1 promoter . Increased number of cases with repair gene methylation were seen with increasing severity of the esophageal pathology suggesting epigenetic progression parallels histologic changes . BAT25 and D3S1313 markers exhibited instability frequently and cases with MSI using these markers showed an abnormal hMLH1 promoter . Thus these markers were useful in identifying the mismatch repair phenotype . These two markers may be useful to screen cases for early cancer related changes , after validation on a larger sample .
Many cells in mammals exist in the state of quiescence , which is characterized by reversible exit from the cell cycle . Quiescent cells are widely reported to exhibit reduced size , nucleotide synthesis , and metabolic activity . Much lower glycolytic rates have been reported in quiescent compared with proliferating lymphocytes . In contrast , we show here that primary human fibroblasts continue to exhibit high metabolic rates when induced into quiescence via contact inhibition . By monitoring isotope labeling through metabolic pathways and quantitatively identifying fluxes from the data , we show that contact-inhibited fibroblasts utilize glucose in all branches of central carbon metabolism at rates similar to those of proliferating cells , with greater overflow flux from the pentose phosphate pathway back to glycolysis . Inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway resulted in apoptosis preferentially in quiescent fibroblasts . By feeding the cells labeled glutamine , we also detected a " backwards " flux in the tricarboxylic acid cycle from alpha-ketoglutarate to citrate that was enhanced in contact-inhibited fibroblasts ; this flux likely contributes to shuttling of NADPH from the mitochondrion to cytosol for redox defense or fatty acid synthesis . The high metabolic activity of the fibroblasts was directed in part toward breakdown and resynthesis of protein and lipid , and in part toward excretion of extracellular matrix proteins . Thus , reduced metabolic activity is not a hallmark of the quiescent state . Quiescent fibroblasts , relieved of the biosynthetic requirements associated with generating progeny , direct their metabolic activity to preservation of self integrity and alternative functions beneficial to the organism as a whole .
The vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib has been approved for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic renal cancer and is currently being trialled in other cancers . However , the effectiveness of this anti-angiogenic agent is limited by the presence of innate and acquired drug resistance . By screening a panel of candidate growth factors we identified fibroblast growth factor 2 ( FGF2 ) as a potent regulator of endothelial cell sensitivity to sunitinib . We show that FGF2 supports endothelial proliferation and de novo tubule formation in the presence of sunitinib and that FGF2 can suppress sunitinib-induced retraction of tubules . Importantly , these effects of FGF2 were ablated by PD173074 , a small molecule inhibitor of FGF receptor signalling . We also show that FGF2 can stimulate pro-angiogenic signalling pathways in endothelial cells despite the presence of sunitinib . Finally , analysis of clinical renal-cancer samples demonstrates that a large proportion of renal cancers strongly express FGF2 . We suggest that therapeutic strategies designed to simultaneously target both VEGF and FGF2 signalling may prove more efficacious than sunitinib in renal cancer patients whose tumours express FGF2 .
Quercetin is a flavonoid with anticancer properties . In this study , we examined the effects of quercetin on cell cycle , viability , and proliferation of cancer cells , either singly or in combination with the microtubule-targeting drugs taxol and nocodazole . Although quercetin induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner , 12.5-50 muM quercetin inhibited the activity of both taxol and nocodazole to induce G2/M arrest in various cell lines . Quercetin also partially restored drug-induced loss in viability of treated cells for up to 72 h . This antagonism of microtubule-targeting drugs was accompanied by a delay in cell cycle progression and inhibition of the buildup of cyclin-B1 at the microtubule organizing center of treated cells . However , quercetin did not inhibit the microtubule targeting of taxol or nocodazole . Despite the short-term protection of cells by quercetin , colony formation and clonogenicity of HCT116 cells were still suppressed by quercetin or quercetin-taxol combination . The status of cell adherence to growth matrix was critical in determining the sensitivity of HCT116 cells to quercetin . We conclude that although long-term exposure of cancer cells to quercetin may prevent cell proliferation and survival , the interference of quercetin with cell cycle progression diminishes the efficacy of microtubule-targeting drugs to arrest cells at G2/M .
PURPOSE Steroid hormones and growth factors affect lung cancer , and it is possible they act in concert to influence patient outcome . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Primary lung tumors and normal lung tissue were analyzed for expression and localization of estrogen receptor alpha and beta-1 ( ERalpha and ERbeta ) , aromatase , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . RESULTS Tumors expressed higher levels of ERbeta compared to matched normal lung , whereas the reverse was true of PR . High cytoplasmic ERbeta expression was identified as an independent negative prognostic predictor of overall survival ( OS ; HR = 1.67 ) , and low total PR was identified as an independent negative predictor of time to progression ( TTP ; HR = 1.59 ) . After adjusting for stage , age , sex , and smoking , combined high cytoplasmic ERbeta and low total PR showed enhanced effects on OS ( HR = 2.64 ) and on TTP ( HR = 6.02 ) . Further effects on OS were observed when EGFR expression was included ( HR = 5.32 ) . Patients with low cytoplasmic ERbeta , low aromatase , low EGFR , and high total PR had shorter OS than patients with the opposite pattern ( HR = 6.60 ) . Contribution of these markers to survival showed no significant sex differences in a multivariable model . ERalpha was elevated in tumors but was not predictive of survival , and appears to represent a variant ERalpha protein that is only recognized by a C-terminal antibody . CONCLUSIONS Hormonal and EGFR pathways together may contribute to lung cancer prognosis . Lung tumors with high ERbeta-1/low PR may define patients with aggressive biology . A validation study is necessary to fully assess the predictive value of these markers .
Although the p16(INK4a) and p21Waf1/Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitors are known to play key roles in cellular senescence in vitro , their roles in senescence remain rather poorly understood in vivo . This situation is partly due to the possibility of compensatory effect(s) between p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 or to the upregulation of functionally related CDK inhibitors . To directly address the cooperative roles of p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in senescence in vivo , we generated a mouse line simply lacking both p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 genes [ double-knockout ( DKO) ] . Mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEF ) derived from DKO mice displayed no evidence of cellular senescence when cultured serially in vitro . Moreover , DKO MEFs readily escaped Ras-induced senescence and overrode contact inhibition in culture . This was not the case in MEFs lacking either p16INK4a or p21Waf1/Cip1 , indicating that p16(INK4a) and p21Waf1/Cip1 play cooperative roles in cellular senescence and contact inhibition in vitro . Notably , we found the DKO mice to be extremely susceptible to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced skin carcinogenesis that involves oncogenic mutation of the H-ras gene . Mechanistic investigations suggested that the high incidence of cancer in DKO mice likely reflected a cooperative effect of increased benign skin tumor formation caused by p21Waf1/Cip1 loss , with increased malignant conversion of benign skin tumors caused by p16(INK4a) loss . Our findings establish an intrinsic cooperation between p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in the onset of cellular senescence and tumor suppression in vivo .
The incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) is increasing but the long-term survival rate remains low . An animal model would therefore be helpful for evaluation of new treatment modalities for oral SCC . Hamster is small animal , therefore , the cancer of hamster cheek pouch is not optimal for tumor imaging . The VX2 cell line has been used in many carcinoma-related studies , including oral SCC research , but it is derived from cutaneous tissue and not mucosa . We chemically induced tongue squamous cell carcinoma in rabbits and subsequently established a rabbit squamous cell line . The cells grew in multiple layers without contact inhibition for 60 passages over 2 years and were positive for cytokeratin ( CK ) . Electron microscopy revealed that cells were polygonal with rich microvilli on the surface , and there were desmosomes between cells and bundles of tonofibril beside the cell membrane . The chromosome number ranged from 71 to 272 , with a modal value of 145 ( 12.4% ) . The cells were transplantable into nude mice subcutaneously or rabbit submucosally and produced carcinomas in all the animals . The cell line should be a useful tool for the study of the biological characteristics of oral SCC , especially tongue SCC .
HGF signaling induces epithelial cells to disassemble cadherin-based adhesion and increase cell motility and invasion , a process termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . EMT plays a major role in cancer metastasis , allowing individual cells to detach from the primary tumor , invade local tissue , and colonize distant tissues with new tumors . While invasion of vascular and lymphatic networks is the predominant route of metastasis , nerves also can act as networks for dissemination of cancer cell to distant sites in a process termed perineual invasion ( PNI ) . Signaling between nerves and invasive cancer cells remains poorly understood , as does cellular decision making that selects the specific route of invasion . Here we examine how HGF signaling contributes to PNI using reductionist culture model systems . We find that TGFbeta , produced by PC12 cells , enhances scattering in response to HGF stimulation , increasing both cell-cell junction disassembly and cell migration . Further , gradients of TGFbeta induce migratory mesenchymal cells to undergo chemotaxis towards the source of TGFbeta . Interestingly , VEGF suppresses TGFbeta-induced enhancement of scattering . These results have broad implications for how combinatorial growth factor signaling contributes to cancer metastasis , suggesting that VEGF and TGFbeta might modulate HGF signaling to influence route selection during cancer progression .
Metastatic cancer cells typically fail to halt migration on contact with non-cancer cells . This invasiveness is in contrast to normal mesenchymal cells that retract on contact with another cell . Why cancer cells are defective in contact inhibition of locomotion is not understood . Here , we analyse the dynamics of prostate cancer cell lines co-cultured with fibroblasts , and demonstrate that a combinatorial code of Eph receptor activation dictates whether cell migration will be contact inhibited . The unimpeded migration of metastatic PC-3 cells towards fibroblasts is dependent on activation of EphB3 and EphB4 by ephrin-B2 , which we show activates Cdc42 and cell migration . Knockdown of EphB3 and EphB4 restores contact inhibition of locomotion to PC-3 cells . Conversely , homotypic collisions between two cancer cells results in contact inhibition of locomotion , mediated by EphA-Rho-Rho kinase ( ROCK ) signalling . Thus , the migration of cancer cells can switch from restrained to invasive , depending on the Eph-receptor profile of the cancer cell and the reciprocal ephrin ligands expressed by neighbouring cells .
An epithelial cell line , referred to as A163 , was established from breast carcinoma derived from a patient with a strong family history of breast cancer but no known breast cancer susceptibility mutation . A163 was propagated in a serum-free culture medium including the epidermal growth factor . Immunophenotypic characterization demonstrated a mixed luminal and basal-like phenotype . When epidermal growth factor was excluded from the culture medium , A163 entered a quiescent period followed by a period of increased cell proliferation in a subpopulation of the cells . The epidermal growth factor-independent subpopulation retained the basal-like phenotype of the parental cell line . Karyotype and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis showed an amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor on 7q in A163-S1 only , resulting in high expression of total and phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor . The A163-S1 sub-line piles up in culture , indicating a loss of contact inhibition . When grown on transwell filters , A163 shows basal expression of P63 and cytokeratin 14 , whereas A163-S1 expresses P63 ubiquitously , and has lost the basal specific expression of cytokeratin 14 , indicating a loss of polarity . Furthermore , when cultured in reconstituted basement membrane matrix , A163 form polarized normal like acini . In contrast , A163-S1 form large disorganized structures with lack of polarity . These cell lines may prove useful to understand molecular changes in breast cancer progression , in particular basal-like breast cancer subtype with bad prognosis and no current treatment options .
C-reactive protein is produced in response to cytokines such as interleukin ( IL)-6 . It is known that increased plasma IL-6 levels induce increased hepatic and intratumoral production of C-reactive protein . Cyclooxygenase enzyme-2 is induced by various stimuli , including inflammation and various growth factors . Expression of these two markers has not been well studied in clear cell renal cell carcinoma . The objective of this study is to correlate the expression of C-reactive protein and cyclooxygenase enzyme-2 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma with pathologic parameters . A search of the surgical pathology and consultation files at our institution was performed for nephrectomy specimens with clear cell renal cell carcinoma from 2007 to 2008 . Immunohistochemical stains for C-reactive protein and cyclooxygenase enzyme-2 were performed . Staining intensity was graded as 0 , 1+ , 2+ , and 3+ . The staining intensity was then correlated with pathologic stage and Fuhrman nuclear grade for each case . A total of 110 cases were identified . Strong expression of C-reactive protein was associated with higher Fuhrman nuclear grade and pathologic stage , and the strength of correlation was statistically significant ( p = 0.01 and p = 0.001 ) , respectively . However , cyclooxygenase enzyme-2 expression did not show statistically significant correlation with both pathologic stage and Fuhrman nuclear grade ( p = 0.1 and p = 0.15 ) , respectively . To our knowledge , this is the largest study to date correlating the expression of both C-reactive protein and cyclooxygenase enzyme-2 in tissue with pathologic parameters in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma , which could have significant prognostic and therapeutic implications .
BACKGROUND Adult human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSC ) have been shown to home to sites of carcinoma and affect biological processes , including tumour growth and metastasis . Previous findings have been conflicting and a clear understanding of the effects of hMSCs on cancer remains to be established . Therefore , we set out to investigate the impact of hMSCs on the oestrogen receptor positive , hormone-dependent breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 . RESULTS In this study , we show the effects of hMSCs on cancer cells are mediated through a secreted factor(s) which are enhanced by cancer cell-hMSC contact/communication . In addition to enhanced proliferation when in co-culture with hMSCs , MCF-7 cells were found to have increased migration potential in vitro . Inhibition of ER signalling by the pure anti-oestrogen ICI 182,780 decreased the effect of hMSCs on MCF-7 cell proliferation and migration supporting a role for ER signalling in the hMSC/MCF-7 cell interaction . Additionally , hMSCs have been shown to secrete a wide variety of growth factors and chemokines including stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( SDF-1 ) . This coupled with the knowledge that SDF-1 is an ER-mediated gene linked with hormone-independence and metastasis led to the investigation of the SDF-1/CXCR4 signalling axis in hMSC-MCF-7 cell interaction . Experiments revealed an increase in SDF-1 gene expression both in vivo and in vitro when MCF-7 cells were cultured with hMSCs . SDF-1 treatment of MCF-7 cells alone increased proliferation to just below that seen with hMSC co-culture . Additionally , blocking SDF-1 signalling using a CXCR4-specific inhibitor decreased hMSC induced proliferation and migration of MCF-7 . However , the combined treatment of ICI and AMD3100 reduced MCF-7 cell proliferation and migration below control levels , indicating targeting both the ER and CXCR4 pathways is effective in decreasing the hMSCs induction of MCF-7 cell proliferation and migration . CONCLUSIONS The sum of these data reveals the relationship between tumour microenvironment and tumour growth and progression . Better understanding of the mechanisms involved in this tumour stroma cell interaction may provide novel targets for the development of treatment strategies for oestrogen receptor positive , hormone-independent , and endocrine-resistant breast carcinoma .
Multiple myeloma is characterized by the clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells ( multiple myeloma cells [ MMCs] ) , in the bone marrow . Osteolytic bone lesions are detected in 80% of patients because of increased osteoclastic bone resorption and reduced osteoblastic bone formation . MMCs are found closely associated with sites of increased bone resorption . Osteoclasts strongly support MMC survival in vitro . To further elucidate the mechanisms involved in osteoclast/MMC interaction , we have identified 552 genes overexpressed in osteoclasts compared with other bone marrow cell subpopulations . Osteoclasts express specifically genes coding for 4 CCR2-targeting chemokines and genes coding for MMC growth factors . An anti-CCR2 monoclonal antibody blocked osteoclast chemoattractant activity for MMC , and CCR2 chemokines are also MMC growth factors , promoting mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in MMC . An anti-insulin growth factor-1 receptor monoclonal antibody completely blocked the osteoclast-induced survival of MMC suppressing both osteoclast and MMC survival . Specific a proliferation-inducing ligand or IL-6 inhibitors partially blocked osteoclast-induced MMC survival . These data may explain why newly diagnosed patients whose MMC express high levels of CCR2 present numerous bone lesions . This study displays additional mechanisms involved in osteoclast/MMC interaction and suggests using CCR2 and/or insulin growth factor-1 targeting strategies to block this interaction and prevent drug resistance .
Many tumors contain heterogeneous populations of cells , only some of which exhibit increased tumorigenicity and resistance to anticancer therapies . Evidence suggests that these aggressive cancer cells , often termed " cancer stem cells " or " cancer stem-like cells " ( CSCs ) , rely upon developmental signaling pathways that are important for survival and expansion of normal stem cells . Here we report that , in analogy to embryonic mammary epithelial biology , estrogen signaling expands the pool of functional breast CSCs through a paracrine FGF/FGFR/Tbx3 signaling pathway . Estrogen or FGF9 pretreatment induced CSC properties of breast cancer cell lines and freshly isolated breast cancer cells , whereas cotreatment of cells with tamoxifen or a small molecule inhibitor of FGFR signaling was sufficient to prevent the estrogen-induced expansion of CSCs . Furthermore , reduction of FGFR or Tbx3 gene expression was able to abrogate tumorsphere formation , whereas ectopic Tbx3 expression increased tumor seeding potential by 100-fold . These findings demonstrate that breast CSCs are stimulated by estrogen through a signaling pathway that similarly controls normal mammary epithelial stem cell biology .
Osteoblastic bone metastases are the most common metastases produced by human prostate cancers ( PCa ) . Deregulated activity of Wnt growth factors resulting from overexpression of the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 ( DKK-1 ) is known to contribute to formation of the osteoblastic component of PCa skeletal bone metastases . In this study , we report that DKK-1 knockdown in osteolytic human PCa cells unexpectedly delays the development of both soft tissue and osseous lesions . PCa cells deficient in DKK-1 expression did not increase canonical Wnt signaling in target osteoblast cell lines ; however , DKK-1 knockdown PCa cells exhibited increased expression of the CDK inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1) and a 32% increase in G(1) arrest compared with control cells . Ablating p21(CIP1/WAF1) in PCa cells deficient in DKK-1 was sufficient to rescue tumor growth . Collectively , our findings demonstrate that DKK-1 overexpression supports tumor growth in part by restricting expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1) through a mechanism independent of canonical Wnt signaling .
It has been demonstrated that growth factors produced by breast cancer cells stimulate aromatase expression in both breast cancer and adjacent adipose fibroblasts and stromal cells . However , whether these growth factors affect aromatase activity by other mechanisms still remain unclear . In the current study , MCF-7aro and T47Daro aromatase transfected breast carcinoma cells were used to explore the mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of aromatase activity by growth factor pathways . Our study reveals that PI3K/Akt and MAPK inhibitors suppressed aromatase activity in MCF-7aro cells . However , PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors stimulated aromatase activity in T47Daro cells . This is due to enhanced MAPK phosphorylation as compensation after the PI3K/Akt pathway has been blocked . IGF-1 treatment increased aromatase activity in both breast cancer cell lines . In addition , LTEDaro cells ( long-term estrogen deprived MCF-7aro cells ) which have enhanced MAPK activity , show higher aromatase activity compared to parental MCF-7aro cells , but the aromatase protein level remains the same . These results suggest that aromatase activity could be enhanced by growth factor signaling pathways via post-transcriptional mechanisms .
Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) remains a common malignant cancer worldwide . There is an urgent need to identify new molecular targets for the development of novel therapeutic approaches . Herein , we review the structure , function and biology of glypican-3 ( GPC3 ) and its role in human cancer with a focus on its potential as a therapeutic target for immunotherapy . GPC3 is a cell-surface protein that is over-expressed in HCC . Loss-of-function mutations of GPC3 cause Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome ( SGBS ) , a rare X-linked overgrowth condition . GPC3 binds Wnt and Hedgehog ( Hh ) signalling proteins . GPC3 is also able to bind basic growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 through its heparan sulphate glycan chains . GPC3 is a promising candidate for liver cancer therapy given that it shows high expression in HCC . An anti-GPC3 monoclonal antibody has shown anti-cancer activity in mice and its humanised IgG molecule is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in patients with HCC . There is also evidence that soluble GPC3 may be a useful serum biomarker for HCC .
A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of DNA repair after exposure to ionizing radiation represents a research priority aimed at improving the outcome of clinical radiotherapy . Because of the close association with DNA double strand break ( DSB ) repair , phosphorylation of the histone H2AX protein ( gammaH2AX ) , quantified by immunodetection , has recently been used as a method to study DSB induction and repair at low and clinically relevant radiation doses . However , the lack of consistency in literature points to the need to further validate the role of H2AX phosphorylation in DSB repair and the use of this technique to determine intrinsic radiosensitivity . In the present study we used human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells , characterized by a radiosensitive phenotype due to reduced levels of the Ku70 and Ku80 repair proteins , and investigated whether this repair-deficient cell line displays differences in the phosphorylation pattern of H2AX protein compared to repair-proficient MCF10A cells . This was established by measuring formation and disappearance of gammaH2AX foci after irradiating synchronized cell populations with ( 60)Co gamma-rays . Our results show statistically significant differences in the number of gammaH2AX foci between the repair-deficient and -proficient cell line , with a higher amount of gammaH2AX foci present at early times post-irradiation in the Ku-deficient cell line . However , the disappearance of those differences at later post-irradiation times questions the use of this assay to determine intrinsic radiosensitivity , especially in a clinical setting .
The radioprotective effects of dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) have been known for many years , and the suppression of hydroxyl ( OH ) radicals induced by ionizing radiation has been thought to be the main cause of this effect . However , the DMSO concentration used was very high , and might be toxic , in earlier studies . In the present study , we administered a lower , non-toxic concentration ( 0.5% , i.e. , 64 mM ) of DMSO before irradiation and examined its radioprotective effects . Colony formation assay and micronucleus assay showed significant radioprotective effects in CHO , but not in xrs5 , which is defective in the repair function of DNA double-strand breaks . The levels of phosphorylated H2AX and the formation of 53BP1 foci 15 minutes after irradiation , which might reflect initial DNA double-strand breaks , in DMSO-treated CHO cells were similar to those in non-treated cells , suggesting that the radioprotective effects were not attributable to the suppression of general indirect action in the lower concentration of DMSO . On the other hand , 2 hours after irradiation , the average number of 53BP1 foci , which might reflect residual DNA double-strand breaks , was significantly decreased in DMSO-treated CHO cells compared to non-treated cells . The results indicated that low concentration of DMSO exerts radioprotective effects through the facilitation of DNA double-strand break repair rather than through the suppression of indirect action .
BACKGROUND IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that signals via binding to a soluble or membrane bound receptor , while nitric oxide ( NO ) , an oxidative stress molecule , diffuses through the cell membrane without a receptor . Both mediators signal through different mechanisms , yet they are dependent on NFkappaB . We proposed that both mediators are co-induced and co-regulated in inflamed mammary epithelial cells . METHODS SCp2 mammary epithelial cells were treated with bacterial endotoxin ( ET ) for different time periods and analyzed for induction of IL-6 secretion and NO production by ELISA and Griess reaction , respectively . The expression of IL-6 and induced NO synthase ( iNOS ) was assayed by real time PCR and/or western immunoblots , and the activation of NFkappaB was assayed by immunobinding assay . To investigate the role of mammary cell microenvironment ( cell-substratum or interaction of mammary epithelial cell types ; critical to mammary development , function , and disease ) in modulation of the inflammatory response , SCp2 cells were cultured with or without extracellular matrix ( EHS ) or in coculture with their myoepithelial counterpart ( SCg6 ) , and assayed for ET-induced IL-6 and NO . RESULTS Endotoxin induced NFkappaB activation at 1 h after ET application . IL-6 secretion and NO production were induced , but with unexpected delay in expression of mRNA for iNOS compared to IL-6 . NFkappaB/p65 activation was transient but NFkappaB/p50 activation persisted longer . Selective inhibition of NFkappaB activation by Wedelolactone reduced ET-induced expression of IL-6 mRNA and protein but not iNOS mRNA or NO production , suggesting differences in IL-6 and iNOS regulation via NFkappaB . SCp2 cells in coculture with SCg6 but not in presence of EHS dramatically induced IL-6 secretion even in the absence of ET . ET-induced NO production was blunted in SCp2/SCg6 cocultures compared to that in SCp2 alone . CONCLUSIONS The differential regulation of IL-6 and iNOS together with the differential activation of different NFkappaB dimers suggest that IL-6 and iNOS are regulated by different NFkappaB dimers , and differentially regulated by the microenvironment of epithelial cells . The understanding of innate immune responses and inflammation in epithelia and linkage thereof is crucial for understanding the link between chronic inflammation and cancer in epithelial tissues such as the mammary gland .
We recently showed that Nox4 NADPH oxidase is highly expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and that it is activated by growth factors and plays a pro-survival , anti-apoptotic role . Here we investigate the mechanisms through which insulin-like growth factor I and serum ( FBS ) activate NADPH oxidase in pancreatic cancer ( PaCa ) cells . We show that in PaCa cells , NADPH oxidase is composed of Nox4 and p22(phox) catalytic subunits , which are both required for NADPH oxidase activity . Insulin-like growth factor I and FBS activate NADPH oxidase through transcriptional up-regulation of p22(phox) . This involves activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB mediated by Akt kinase . Up-regulation of p22(phox) by the growth factors results in increased Nox4-p22(phox) complex formation and activation of NADPH oxidase . This mechanism is different from that for receptor-induced activation of phagocytic NADPH oxidase , which is mediated by phosphorylation of its regulatory subunits . Up-regulation of p22(phox) represents a novel pro-survival mechanism through which growth factors and Akt inhibit apoptosis in PaCa cells .
Monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) to HER2 are currently used to treat breast cancer , but low clinical efficacy , along with primary and acquired resistance to therapy , commonly limit clinical applications . We previously reported that combinations of antibodies directed at non-overlapping epitopes of HER2 are endowed with enhanced antitumor effects , probably due to accelerated receptor degradation . Here , we extend these observations to three-dimensional mammary cell models , and compare the effects of single mAbs with the effects of antibody combinations . Collectively , our in vitro assays and computational image analyses indicate that combining mAbs against different epitopes of HER2 better inhibits invasive growth . Importantly , while growth factors are able to reduce intraluminal apoptosis and induce an invasive phenotype , combinations of mAbs better than single mAbs can reverse the growth factor-induced phenotypes of HER2-overexpressing spheroids . In conclusion , our studies propose that mAb combinations negate the biological effects of growth factors on invasive growth of HER2-overexpressing cells . Hence , combining mAbs offers a therapeutic strategy , potentially able to enhance clinical efficacy of existing antireceptor immunotherapeutics .
BACKGROUND Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells show prolonged survival in vivo , but rapidly die by spontaneous apoptosis in vitro , unless they are co-cultured with stromal cells or non-malignant leukocytes . The objective of this study was to characterize the survival-inducing cross-talk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with their microenvironment to identify novel therapeutic targets . DESIGN AND METHODS We analyzed and compared microarray-based expression profiles of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells before and after three different survival-inducing culture conditions : ( i ) stromal cell co-culture , ( ii ) stromal cell conditioned medium and ( iii ) high cell density cultures of unsorted peripheral blood mononuclear cells . Cytokine antibody arrays were applied to study the composition of soluble factors present in these cultures . RESULTS The different survival-supportive culture conditions induced distinct gene expression changes , the majority of which were common to all three conditions . Pathway analyses identified - in addition to known signaling networks in chronic lymphocytic leukemia - novel pathways , of which Toll-like receptor signaling , nuclear respiratory factor-2 ( NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress response , and signaling via triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 ( TREM1 ) were the most relevant . A high proportion of up-regulated genes were inflammatory cytokines , of which chemokine ( C-C motif ) ligand 2 ( CCL2 ) was shown to be induced in monocytes by the presence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro . In addition , increased serum levels of this chemokine were detected in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia . CONCLUSIONS Our data provide several lines of evidence that an inflammatory microenvironment is induced in survival-supportive cultures of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells which might be directly or indirectly involved in the prolonged survival of the malignant cells .
PURPOSE BMP-6 , which belongs to the TGF-beta superfamily , is a multifunctional molecule with distinct abilities in embryogenesis and organogenesis . Our recent research has implied that BMP-6 may suppress breast cancer metastasis . In the present study , we extended to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which BMP-6 exerts its anti-tumorigenic effect . METHODS The Boyden chamber assay was used to examine the ability of BMP-6 and HO-1 in MCF-7 malignant progress . RT-PCR , western blot , luciferase assay , and quantitative CHIP were used to determine the potential mechanism and signaling pathways by which BMP-6 and HO-1 function as anti-metastatic factors in MCF-7 cells . RESULTS The Boyden chamber assay showed that BMP-6 inhibited the migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells , which effect was significantly deprived by knockdown of HO-1 . We further demonstrated that BMP-6 treatment resulted in an activation of HO-1 transcription through the recruitment of Smad1/5 to the Smad-responsive element on its promoter . In addition , BMP-6-induced up-regulation of HO-1 exhibited an inhibitory effect on MMP-9 secretion in a paracrine action in MCF-7 cells . Overexpression of BMP-6 and HO-1 synergistically suppressed MMP-9 transcription , which effect was specifically mediated via the MAPK/p38/AP-1 signaling . However , blockade of HO-1 using ZnPPIX totally abolished BMP-6-regulated MMP-9 activation in MCF-7 cells . CONCLUSIONS These observations suggest a novel role of BMP-6/HO-1 cascade to relieve breast cancer metastasis by regulating the secretion of growth factors in tumor microenvironment .
PURPOSE Germline mutations in BRCA1 result in a strong predisposition to breast cancer , with frequent loss of heterozygosity of the remaining wild-type allele . The development of BRCA1 tumors is likely to depend on additional genetic alterations and gene expression changes which follow growth and DNA repair defects associated with BRCA1 deficiency . The identification of these modifications offers an opportunity to find surrogate markers of BRCA1 tumors . Here , we sought to identify differentially expressed proteins related to BRCA1 depletion . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We used isogenic HeLa cells either stably knocked-down or not for BRCA1 ( BRCA1(KD) ) and compared protein profiles of these cells by DIGE . RESULTS We detected increased levels of Replication protein A2 ( RPA2 ) in BRCA1(KD) cells as compared to control cells . RPA2 is an essential protein required for DNA replication and repair . We further demonstrated that depletion of RPA2 subunit delays growth of BRCA1(KD) respect to isogenic control cells . Strikingly , elevated levels of RPA2 were more frequently observed in BRCA1 tumors when triple-negative tumors from BRCA1 mutation carriers ( n=13 ) and non-carriers ( n=36 ) were stained in situ for RPA2 . CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE RPA2 up-regulation may thus be involved in the growth and/or survival of BRCA1 tumor cells and useful in immunohistochemical discrimination of triple-negative BRCA1 tumors .
BACKGROUND Epidemiologic data have shown that obesity independently increases colorectal cancer ( CRC ) risk , but the mechanisms are poorly understood . Obesity is an inflammatory state , and chronic colonic inflammation induces CRC . OBJECTIVE We conducted this proof-of-principle study to seek evidence of obesity-associated colorectal inflammation and to evaluate effects of diet-induced weight loss . DESIGN We measured inflammatory cytokines , gene arrays , and macrophage infiltration in rectosigmoid mucosal biopsies of 10 obese premenopausal women [ mean +/- SD body mass index ( in kg/m(2) ) : 35 +/- 3.5 ] before and after weight loss induced by a very-low-calorie diet . RESULTS Subjects lost a mean ( +/-SD ) of 10.1 +/- 1% of their initial weight . Weight loss significantly reduced fasting blood glucose , total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , and interleukin ( IL)-8 concentrations ( P < 0.05 ) . After weight loss , rectosigmoid biopsies showed a 25-57% reduction in TNF-alpha , IL-1beta , IL-8 , and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 concentrations ( P < 0.05 ) . T cell and macrophage counts decreased by 28% and 42% , respectively ( P < 0.05 ) . Gene arrays showed dramatic down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine pathways , prostaglandin metabolism , and the transcription factors STAT3 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ) and nuclear transcription factor kappaB . Weight loss reduced expression of FOS and JUN genes and down-regulated oxidative stress pathways and the transcription factors ATF ( activating transcription factor ) and CREB ( cyclic AMP response element-binding ) . CONCLUSIONS Our data show that diet-induced weight loss in obese individuals reduces colorectal inflammation and greatly modulates inflammatory and cancer-related gene pathways . These data imply that obesity is accompanied by inflammation in the colorectal mucosa and that diet-induced weight loss reduces this inflammatory state and may thereby lower CRC risk .
SWAP-70 , a phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate ( PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) ) binding protein , has been suggested to be involved in transformation of mouse embryo fibroblasts ( MEFs ) as well as membrane ruffling after growth factor stimulation of the cells . A mutant , SWAP-70-374 , was found to be able to bind to F-actin in vitro , whereas wild-type SWAP-70 failed to do so . This mutant was present at the plasma membrane without any stimulation while the wild-type protein was present only in the cytosol unless cells were stimulated with EGF . Expression of this mutant in MEFs resulted in morphologic transformation , fast growth , and loss of contact inhibition , suggesting that SWAP-70 with this mutation can transform the cells . ERK1/2 was activated in SWAP-70-374-transformed cells . Use of MEK inhibitors revealed that the ERK1/2 pathway does not affect the cell growth of MEFs but is responsible for loss of contact inhibition . To investigate the function of SWAP-70 further , drugs that can inhibit SWAP-70-dependent cell responses were screened . Among various drugs , sanguinarine was found to inhibit transformation of MEFs by SWAP-70-374 . This drug was able to inhibit SWAP-70-mediated membrane ruffling as well , suggesting that its effect was closely related to the SWAP-70 signaling pathway . These results suggest that SWAP-70-374 can activate some signaling pathways , including the ERK1/2 pathway , to transform MEFs .
Melanoma progression is associated with the expression of different growth factors , cytokines , and chemokines . Because TGFbeta1 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved not only in physiologic processes but also in cancer development , we analyzed in A375 human melanoma cells , the effect of TGFbeta1 on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) and interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) expression , two known factors responsible for melanoma progression . TGFbeta1 increased the expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 in A375 cells , an effect mediated by the cross-talk between Smad , PI3K ( phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT , and BRAF-MAPK ( mitogen activated protein kinase ) signaling pathways . Supernatants from TGFbeta1-treated A375 cells enhanced MCP-1-dependent migration of monocytes , which , in turn , expressed high levels of TGF,beta1 , bFGF , and VEGF mRNA . Moreover , these supernatants also inhibited functional properties of dendritic cells through IL-10-dependent mechanisms . When using in vitro , the TGFbeta1-blocking peptide P144 , TGFbeta1-dependent Smad3 phosphorylation , and expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 were inhibited . In vivo , treatment of A375 tumor-bearing athymic mice with P144 significantly reduced tumor growth , associated with a lower macrophage infiltrate and decreased intratumor MCP-1 and VEGF levels , as well as angiogenesis . Finally , in C57BL/6 mice with B16-OVA melanoma tumors , when administered with immunotherapy , P144 decreased tumor growth and intratumor IL-10 levels , linked to enhanced activation of dendritic cells and natural killer cells , as well as anti-OVA T-cell responses . These results show new effects of TGFbeta1 on melanoma cells , which promote tumor progression and immunosuppression , strongly reinforcing the relevance of this cytokine as a molecular target in melanoma .
The polycomb group family protein BMI-1 is overexpressed by and functions as an oncogene in many different human cancers . We have previously shown that BMI-1 promotes the tumorigenicity of Ewing sarcoma family tumors ( ESFTs ) and that this is mediated independently of CDKN2A repression . In this study , we have discovered that high levels of BMI-1 confer resistance to contact inhibition in ESFT cells . Using stable retroviral transduction , we evaluated the consequences of BMI-1 knockdown on the growth of CDKN2A wild-type and mutant ESFT cells in subconfluent and confluent conditions . Although knockdown of BMI-1 had no effect on proliferation in low-density cultures , at high cell densities it resulted in cell cycle arrest and death . The normal cell contact inhibition response is mediated , in large part , by the recently described Hippo pathway which functions to inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell death by inactivating the Yes-Associated Protein ( YAP ) . Significantly , we found that YAP levels , activity and expression did not diminish in confluent ESFT cells that expressed high levels of BMI-1 . In contrast , YAP expression and nuclear localization were reduced in confluent BMI-1 knockdown cells suggesting that silencing of BMI-1 restored contact inhibition by restoring normal activation of the Hippo-YAP growth-suppressor pathway . Importantly , knockdown of YAP in ESFT cells resulted in profound inhibition of cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation suggesting that stabilization and continued expression of YAP is critical for ESFT growth and tumorigenicity . Together , these studies reveal a previously unrecognized link between BMI-1 , contact inhibition and the Hippo-YAP pathway and suggest that resistance to contact inhibition in BMI-1 overexpressing cancer cells may be in part a result of Hippo inhibition and aberrant stabilization of YAP .
Extensive biochemical and structural analyses have been performed on the putative DNA repair proteins of hyperthermophilic archaea , in contrast to the few genetic analyses of the genes encoding these proteins . Accordingly , little is known about the repair pathways used by archaeal cells at high temperature . Here , we attempted to disrupt the genes encoding the potential repair proteins in the genome of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis . We succeeded in isolating null mutants of the hjc , hef , hjm , xpb , and xpd genes , but not the radA , rad50 , mre11 , herA , nurA , and xpg/fen1 genes . Phenotypic analyses of the gene-disrupted strains showed that the xpb and xpd null mutants are only slightly sensitive to ultraviolet ( UV ) irradiation , methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) and mitomycin C ( MMC ) , as compared with the wild-type strain . The hjm null mutant showed sensitivity specifically to mitomycin C. On the other hand , the null mutants of the hjc gene lacked increasing sensitivity to any type of DNA damage . The Hef protein is particularly important for maintaining genome homeostasis , by functioning in the repair of a wide variety of DNA damage in T. kodakaraensis cells . Deletion of the entire hef gene or of the segments encoding either its nuclease or helicase domain produced similar phenotypes . The high sensitivity of the Deltahef mutants to MMC suggests that Hef performs a critical function in the repair process of DNA interstrand cross-links . These damage-sensitivity profiles suggest that the archaeal DNA repair system has processes depending on repair-related proteins different from those of eukaryotic and bacterial DNA repair systems using homologous repair proteins analyzed here .
Bone is the second most common metastatic site in patients with renal cell carcinoma presenting with metastases ( mRCC ) at diagnosis . Complications of metastatic bone disease , including bone pain , fractures , spinal cord compression , and hypercalcaemia , are the primary cause of decline in the quality of life of patients with mRCC . Currently , treatment for mRCC bone metastases is generally palliative . Bisphosphonates are also used ; however , the efficacy of bisphosphonates in conjunction with targeted agents is currently unknown . As growth factors play a critical role in the development of bone metastases , there is a biological rationale for the use of targeted agents to treat them . We report here the case of two patients with mRCC with surgically unresectable sacral bone metastases treated with sunitinib , who are still alive with long-term stabilization of metastases of 48 and 31 months . Results suggest targeted agents such as sunitinib may be an effective treatment for bone metastases .
BACKGROUND Induction of osteolytic bone lesions in multiple myeloma is caused by an uncoupling of osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation . Current management of myeloma bone disease is limited to the use of antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphonates . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We tested the effects of daily administered parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) on bone disease and myeloma growth , and we investigated molecular mechanisms by analyzing gene expression profiles of unique myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma cells engrafted in SCID-rab and SCID-hu mouse models . PTH resulted in increased bone mineral density of myelomatous bones and reduced tumor burden , which reflected the dependence of primary myeloma cells on the bone marrow microenvironment . Treatment with PTH also increased bone mineral density of uninvolved murine bones in myelomatous hosts and bone mineral density of implanted human bones in nonmyelomatous hosts . In myelomatous bone , PTH markedly increased the number of osteoblasts and bone-formation parameters , and the number of osteoclasts was unaffected or moderately reduced . Pretreatment with PTH before injecting myeloma cells increased bone mineral density of the implanted bone and delayed tumor progression . Human global gene expression profiling of myelomatous bones from SCID-hu mice treated with PTH or saline revealed activation of multiple distinct pathways involved in bone formation and coupling ; involvement of Wnt signaling was prominent . Treatment with PTH also downregulated markers typically expressed by osteoclasts and myeloma cells , and altered expression of genes that control oxidative stress and inflammation . PTH receptors were not expressed by myeloma cells , and PTH had no effect on myeloma cell growth in vitro . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE We conclude that PTH-induced bone formation in myelomatous bones is mediated by activation of multiple signaling pathways involved in osteoblastogenesis and attenuated bone resorption and myeloma growth ; mechanisms involve increased osteoblast production of anti-myeloma factors and minimized myeloma induction of inflammatory conditions .
Our purpose in this randomized , double blind , placebo controlled study was to find out the possible effect of a polyphenolic pine bark extract , Pycnogenol(R) ( Pyc ) on the level of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine ( 8-oxoG ) as representative of oxidative damage to DNA and on the DNA repair ability of elderly people . According to our results , three months of Pyc administration had no effect on the level of oxidative damage to DNA or on repair ability , but we found a relationship between the level of 8-oxoG and repair ability of DNA in this group . To conclude , even if the positive effect of Pyc was not confirmed in the case of elderly people it is important to highlight the necessity of further investigations about the mechanisms of Pyc acting on different age groups .
Dentin matrix protein 1 ( DMP1 ) is a member of the small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein ( SIBLING ) family , a group of proteins initially described as mineralized extracellular matrices components . More recently , SIBLINGs have been implicated in several key steps of cancer progression , including angiogenesis . Although proangiogenic activities have been demonstrated for 2 SIBLINGs , the role of DMP1 in angiogenesis has not yet been addressed . We demonstrate that this extracellular matrix protein induced the expression of vascular endothelial cadherin ( VE-cadherin ) , a key regulator of intercellular junctions and contact inhibition of growth of endothelial cells that is also known to modulate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR-2 ) activity , the major high-affinity receptor for VEGF . DMP1 induced VE-cadherin and p27(Kip1) expression followed by cell-cycle arrest in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) in a CD44-dependent manner . VEGF-induced proliferation , migration , and tubulogenesis responses were specifically blocked on DMP1 pretreatment of HUVECs . Indeed , after VE-cadherin induction , DMP1 inhibited VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and Src-mediated signaling . However , DMP1 did not interfere with basic fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis . In vivo , DMP1 significantly reduced laser-induced choroidal neovascularization lesions and tumor-associated angiogenesis . These data enable us to put DMP1 on the angiogenic chessboard for the first time and to identify this protein as a new specific inhibitor of VEGF-induced angiogenesis .
Modeling the behavior of mammalian arachnoid cells is critical to understand hydrocephalus and other brain disorders involving abnormal flow of cerebrospinal fluid , yet relatively little is known about the physiology of arachnoid cells due to lack of a robust three-dimensional model system . Explanted primary cultures have been the only option to study transport across arachnoid cell membranes , but practical limitations of primary culture include slow growth , early senescence , and poor reproducibility . The purpose of this study was to create immortalized rat arachnoid cell lines to permit in vitro study of arachnoid granulations and properties of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) flow . We established and partially characterized two immortalized cell lines generated from primary rat arachnoid cells , using retroviral gene transfer of SV40 large T antigen ( SV40 LTAg ) either with or without human telomerase ( hTERT ) . The established cell lines stably express either SV40 LTAg alone , or SV40 LTAg and hTERT , and demonstrate high proliferative rate , contact inhibition at confluence , and stable expression of protein markers characteristic of native arachnoid cells over more than 160 passages .
Chemoprevention is one feasible approach to decreasing morbidity and mortality of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The present study aimed to explore the mechanisms of chemoprevention of NSCLC by Prunella vulgaris L . ( PV ) using a PV extract of 60% ethanol ( P-60 ) . In an A/J mouse model benzo[a]pyrene induction of lung tumors was significantly reduced difference by P-60 group . In addition , P-60 was found to have the ability to regulate cell cycle and induce apoptosis in SPC-A-1 cells . Therefore , we propose that P-60 has potential as a lung cancer chemopreventive agent .
BACKGROUND Nucleolin is one of the major proteins of the nucleolus , but it is also expressed on the cell surface where is serves as a binding protein for variety of ligands implicated in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis . Emerging evidence suggests that the cell-surface expressed nucleolin is a strategic target for an effective and nontoxic cancer therapy . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS By monitoring the expression of nucleolin mRNA , and by measuring the level of nucleolin protein recovered from the surface and nucleus of cells , here we show that the presence of nucleolin at the cell surface is dependent on the constant induction of nucleolin mRNA . Indeed , inhibitors of RNA transcription or translation block expression of surface nucleolin while no apparent effect is observed on the level of nucleolin in the nucleus . The estimated half-life of surface nucleolin is less than one hour , whereas that of nuclear nucleolin is more than 8 hours . Nucleolin mRNA induction is reduced markedly in normal fibroblasts that reach confluence , while it occurs continuously even in post-confluent epithelial tumor cells consistent with their capacity to proliferate without contact inhibition . Interestingly , cold and heat shock induce nucleolin mRNA concomitantly to enhanced mRNA expression of the heat shock protein 70 , thus suggesting that surface nucleolin induction also occurs in response to an environmental insult . At the cell surface , one of the main functions of nucleolin is to shuttle specific extracellular ligands by an active transport mechanism , which we show here to be calcium dependent . CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE Our results demonstrate that the expression of surface nucleolin is an early metabolic event coupled with tumor cell proliferation and stress response . The fact that surface nucleolin is constantly and abundantly expressed on the surface of tumor cells , makes them a preferential target for the inhibitory action of anticancer agents that target surface nucleolin .
BACKGROUND/AIMS Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) have been implicated in antitumor therapy for hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tumors . Cell-contact and soluble factors are demonstrated to play a role in the growth inhibition of tumor cells mediated by MSCs in vitro , while there is little clue about signaling pathways involved in the process . P38 MAPK has been implicated as a suppressor of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis . We here investigate whether p38 MAPK is involved in MSC-induced growth inhibition of leukemic tumor cells . Methods : We characterized the effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells ( UC-MSCs ) on proliferation , cell cycle and phosphorylation pattern of p38 MAPK in HL60 and K562 cells . SB203580 , a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK , or p38 MAPK-small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , were used to identify the role of p38 in growth suppression by UC-MSCs . We also investigated the expression of cell cycle regulators . RESULTS Treatment with UC-MSCs led to potent proliferation-inhibition of HL60 and K562 cells without inducing apoptosis . Growth inhibition by UC-MSCs was due to G0/G1 arrest . UC-MSCs increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in HL60 and K562 cells . Pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing ( through siRNA ) of p38 MAPK partially abrogated the proliferation-suppression and cell cycle arrest caused by UC-MSCs . UC-MSCs also modulated the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in HL60 and K562 cells while SB203580 reversed the effect . CONCLUSION Taken together , our findings indicate that p38 MAPK is critical for the growth inhibitory effect of UC-MSCs on leukemic tumor cells .
Background : Several polymorphisms in the DNA repair gene have been extensively studied in the association with various human cancers such as breast cancer . Material and methods : We investigated the association of polymorphisms in the DNA repair genes XRCC1-Arg399Gln , XRCC2-Arg188His and RAD51-135G/C with the breast cancer risk . Genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP assays in 220 patients with breast cancer and 220 age-matched healthy controls . Results : Our results demonstrated a significant positive association between the XRCC1 399Gln/Gln homozygous genotype and breast carcinoma , with an adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) of 2.08 [ 1.08-3.98 ] . The 399Gln allele variant was also associated with type I breast cancer ( OR = 1.41 [ 0.98-2.01 ] , p = 0.034 ) . The distributions of genotypes and alleles of the genes XRCC2 and RAD51 polymorphism were not significantly associated with the different stages of breast carcinoma ( p > 0.05 ) . Conclusion : These results suggest that 399Gln allele of XRCC1 Arg399Gln may be a risk factor for breast cancer in the Polish population .
Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) receptor agonists represent a new approach for the treatment of thrombocytopenia , which may develop as a consequence of immune thrombocytopenia , chemotherapy treatment , chronic hepatitis C infection , or myelodysplastic syndromes . There are concerns that use of certain growth factors can hasten disease progression in some types of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors . In this study , expression of MPL ( TPO-R ) mRNA was examined in tumor cell lines , patient tumor samples ( renal cell carcinoma , prostatic carcinoma , soft tissue and bony/cartilage sarcoma , colon cancer , and lymphoma ) , and normal tissues using microarray analysis and qRT-PCR . MPL mRNA is expressed at very low or undetectable levels compared with erythropoietin receptor ( EPOR ) , human epidermal growth factor ( ERBB2 ; HER2 ) , and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF1R ) in these patient samples . These data suggest TPO-R agonists will likely preferentially stimulate proliferation and differentiation of cells of megakaryocytic lineage , potentially demonstrating their utility for correcting thrombocytopenia in clinical settings .
BACKGROUND Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes are associated with ability to remove DNA lesions , and therefore may contribute to an individual's susceptibility to different types of cancer . Base excision repair ( BER ) , and nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) are the main DNA repair pathways . The present study was conducted to determine the frequency distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) selected for genes in these two pathways i.e . OGG1 Exon 7 ( C1245G ) , XPC Intron 9 ( PAT ) , and Exon 15 ( A33512C ) in a North Indian population in comparison with global populations . METHODS Genotyping was achieved by PCR-based analysis in 224 normal healthy , unrelated individuals of similar ethnicity . RESULTS Allelic frequencies in wild type of OGG1 Exon 7 C>G were 73% ( C ) ; XPC PAT D>I 75% ( D ) ; and XPC Exon 15 A>C 60.71.9% A. On the other hand , the variant allele frequency were 27% ( G ) in OGG1 Exon 7 C>G ; 25% ( I ) in XPC PAT ; and 28.1% ( C ) in XPC Exon 15 A>C . Major differences from other ethnic populations were observed . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that frequency distribution in these DNA repair genes exhibited a distinctive pattern in our population which could be attributed to ethnic variation . This could assist in high-risk screening of humans exposed to environmental carcinogens and cancer predisposition in different ethnic groups .
OBJECTIVES Despite the well-defined histological types of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , a given stage is often associated with wide-ranging survival rates and treatment outcomes . This disparity has led to an increased demand for the discovery and identification of new informative biomarkers . METHODS In the current study , we screened 81 NSCLC samples using Illumina whole-genome gene expression microarrays in an effort to identify differentially expressed genes and new NSCLC biomarkers . RESULTS We identified novel genes whose expression was upregulated in NSCLC , including SPAG5 , POLH , KIF23 , and RAD54L , which are associated with mitotic spindle formation , DNA repair , chromosome segregation , and dsDNA break repair , respectively . We also identified several novel genes whose expression was downregulated in NSCLC , including SGCG , NLRC4 , MMRN1 , and SFTPD , which are involved in extracellular matrix formation , apoptosis , blood vessel leakage , and inflammation , respectively . We found a significant correlation between RNA degradation and survival in adenocarcinoma cases . CONCLUSIONS Even though the follow-up time was too limited to draw final conclusions , we were able to show better prediction p values in a group selection based on molecular profiles compared to histology . The current study also uncovered new candidate biomarker genes that are likely to be involved in diverse processes associated with NSCLC development .
SCOPE In this study , we evaluated the efficacy of lycopene against the growth of prostate cancer in vivo . METHODS AND RESULTS Athymic nude mice were implanted subcutaneously with human androgen-independent prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells . They were supplemented with a low or a high dose of lycopene ( 4 and 16 mg/kg ) and a single dose of beta-carotene ( 16 mg/kg ) twice a week for 7 wk . At the end of the experiment , both lycopene and beta-carotene strongly inhibited the tumor growth , as evidenced by the decrease in tumor volume and tumor weight . High-dosage lycopene and beta-carotene significantly decreased the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in tumor tissues and increased the levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 in plasma . In addition , high-dosage lycopene supplementation significantly decreased the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) levels in plasma . In contrast , beta-carotene supplementation significantly increased the VEGF levels , as compared with tumor control group . CONCLUSION Lycopene and beta-carotene supplementation suppressed the growth of prostate tumor cells , and the effects are likely associated with reduction of proliferation ( attenuation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression ) and with interference of the insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling ( increased plasma insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 levels ) . Furthermore , the inhibition of VEGF by lycopene suggests that the antitumor mechanisms of lycopene also involve anti-angiogenesis .
Radiotherapy for head and neck tumors often results in persistent loss of function in salivary glands . Patients suffering from impaired salivary function frequently terminate treatment prematurely because of reduced quality of life caused by malnutrition and other debilitating side-effects . It has been previously shown in mice expressing a constitutively active form of Akt ( myr-Akt1 ) , or in mice pretreated with IGF1 , apoptosis is suppressed , which correlates with maintained salivary gland function measured by stimulated salivary flow . Induction of cell cycle arrest may be important for this protection by allowing cells time for DNA repair . We have observed increased accumulation of cells in G2/M at acute time-points after irradiation in parotid glands of mice receiving pretreatment with IGF1 . As p21 , a transcriptional target of the p53 family , is necessary for maintaining G2/M arrest , we analyzed the roles of p53 and p63 in modulating IGF1-stimulated p21 expression . Pretreatment with IGF1 reduces binding of DeltaNp63 to the p21 promoter after irradiation , which coincides with increased p53 binding and sustained p21 transcription . Our data indicate a role for DeltaNp63 in modulating p53-dependent gene expression and influencing whether a cell death or cell cycle arrest program is initiated .
Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) is the most common primary brain tumour in adults , with a median survival of months post-diagnosis . GBM usually recurs within 12 months post-resection , with poor prognosis . Thus , novel therapeutic strategies to target and kill GBM cells are urgently needed . The marked difference of tumour cells with respect to normal brain cells renders glioblastoma a good candidate for selective targeted therapies . Recent experimental strategies focus on over expressed cell surface receptors . Targeted toxins represent a new class of selective molecules composed by a potent protein toxin and a carrier ligand . Targeted toxins approaches against glioblastoma were under investigation in phase I and II clinical trials with several immunotoxins ( IT)/ligand toxins such as IL4-Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A ( IL4-PE , NBI-3001 ) , tumour growth factor fused to PE38 , a shorter PE variant , ( TGF)alpha-TP-38 , IL13-PE38 , and a transferrin-C diphtheriae toxin mutant ( Tf-CRM107 ) . In this work , we studied the effects of the plant ribosome-inactivating saporin and of its chimera transferrin-saporin against two different GBM cell lines . The data obtained here indicate that cell proliferation is affected by the toxin treatments but that different mechanisms are used , directly linked to the presence of an active or inactive p53 . A model is proposed for these alternative intracellular pathways .
E6-associated protein ( E6-AP ) is a dual function protein . It acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase enzyme and coactivator of steroid hormone receptors such as estrogen ( ERalpha ) and progesterone ( PR ) receptors . It promotes the degradation of ERalpha and PR through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway . Furthermore , it has been shown that the levels of E6-AP are inversely associated with that of ERalpha in human breast tumors . But the role of wild-type human E6-AP and its ubiquitin-protein ligase activity in mammary tumorigenesis is still unknown . To investigate this role , the authors utilized transgenic mice lines that specifically overexpress either the wild-type human E6-AP ( E6-AP(WT) ) or the ubiquitin-protein ligase defective E6-AP that contains C833S mutation ( E6-AP(C833S) ) in the mammary gland . To further substantiate the role of E6-AP in the development of breast tumorigenesis , it was also examined the expression of E6-AP in a large cohort of human breast cancer samples . The transgenic mice that overexpress wild-type E6-AP ( E6-AP(WT) ) fail to develop mammary tumors . Unlike the E6-AP(WT) mice , the E6-AP(C833S) mice that overexpress ubiquitin-protein ligase defective E6-AP protein develop mammary hyperplasia with a median latency of 18months . These observations suggest that the inactivation of the ubiquitin-protein ligase function of E6-AP is sufficient to initiate the process of mammary tumor development . Furthermore , the data also suggests that E6-AP exerts its effects on target cells by modulating the protein levels and functions of ERalpha and PR . In addition , it was found in human breast cancer patients that the level of E6-AP is decreased in invasive breast tumors compared to normal breast tissue . Moreover , the authors also show that the survival patterns for E6-AP negative patients were worse compared to E6-AP positive patients . Taken together , these data suggests that E6-AP may act as a tumor suppressor in breast .
Ultraviolet ( UV ) of sunlight is a complete carcinogen that can burn skin , enhance inflammation , and drive skin carcinogenesis . Previously , we have shown that sulforaphane ( SFN ) inhibited chemically induced skin carcinogenesis via nuclear factor ( erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 ( Nrf2 ) and others have shown that broccoli sprout extracts containing high SFN protected against UV-induced skin carcinogenesis in SKH-1 hairless mice . A recent study showed that there was no difference between Nrf2 knockout ( Nrf2 KO ) and Nrf2 wild-type ( WT ) BALB/C mice after exposing to high dose of UVB . Since Nrf2 plays critical roles in the anti-oxidative stress/anti-inflammatory responses , it is relevant to assess the role of Nrf2 for photoprotection against UV . In this context , the role of Nrf2 in UVB-induced skin inflammation in Nrf2 WT and Nrf2 KO C57BL/6 mice was studied . A single dose of UVB ( 300 mJ/cm(2) ) resulted in skin inflammation in both WT and Nrf2 KO ( -/- ) mice ( KO mice ) at 8 h and 8 d following UVB irradiation . In the WT mice inflammation returned to the basal level to a greater extent when compared to the KO mice . SFN treatment of Nrf2 WT but not Nrf2 KO mice restored the number of sunburn cells back to their basal level by 8 d after UVB irradiation . Additionally , UVB-induced short-term inflammatory biomarkers ( interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6 ) were increased in the KO mice and UVB-induced apoptotic cells in the KO mice were significantly higher as compared to that in the WT . Taken together , our results show that functional Nrf2 confers a protective effect against UVB-induced inflammation , sunburn reaction , and SFN-mediated photoprotective effects in the skin .
The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug tepoxalin on canine tumour cell growth and describe the changes associated with tepoxalin treatment . In vitro experiments were performed to assess tepoxalin-associated alterations in tumour cell growth . Clinically achievable tepoxalin concentrations did not significantly alter tumour cell growth in vitro . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) production and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha dose-dependently increased in vitro in the presence of tepoxalin . A canine osteosarcoma xenograft was used to determine in vivo effects of tepoxalin on tumour growth and angiogenesis . Despite increased VEGF in vitro , there was a significant growth delay associated with tepoxalin treatment . Normal dogs were administered tepoxalin to assess effects on systemic VEGF production , but not found to have significantly increased VEGF . These data suggest that tepoxalin may moderately inhibit tumour growth and may be administered as an analgesic to tumour-bearing dogs .
AIMS Three-month chronic systemic-to-pulmonary shunting in growing piglets has been reported as an early pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) model with preserved right ventricular ( RV ) function . We sought to determine whether prolonged shunting might be associated with more severe PAH and RV failure . METHODS AND RESULTS Fourteen growing piglets were randomized to a sham operation or the anastomosis of the left innominate artery to the pulmonary arterial trunk . Six months later , the shunt was closed and the animals underwent haemodynamic evaluation followed by tissue sampling for pathobiological assessment . Prolonged shunting had resulted in increased mean pulmonary artery pressure ( 22 +/- 2 versus 17 +/- 1 mmHg ) and pulmonary arteriolar medial thickness , while cardiac output was decreased . However , RV-arterial coupling was markedly deteriorated , with a decrease in the ratio of end-systolic to pulmonary arterial elastances ( Ees/Ea ) . Lung tissue expressions of endothelin-1 , angiopoietin-1 , and bone morphogenetic protein receptor-2 were similarly altered compared with previously observed after 3-month shunting . At the RV tissue level , pro-apoptotic ratio of Bax-to-Bcl-2 expressions and caspase-3 activation were increased , along with an increase in cardiomyocyte size , while expressions in voltage-gated potassium channels ( Kv1.5 and Kv2.1 ) and angiogenic factors ( angiopoietin-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor ) were decreased . Right ventricular expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ interleukin ( IL)-1alpha , IL-1beta , tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha) ] and natriuretic peptide precursors ( NPPA and NPPB ) were increased . There was an inverse correlation between RV Ees/Ea and pro-apoptotic Bax/Bcl-2 ratios . CONCLUSIONS Prolonged left-to-right shunting in piglets does not further aggravate pulmonary vasculopathy , but is a cause of RV failure , which appears related to an activation of apoptosis and inflammation .
Gliomas are the most common tumors in the central nervous system , the average survival time of patients with glioblastoma multiforme being about 1 year from diagnosis , in spite of harsh therapy . Aiming to study the transcriptional profiles displayed by glioma cells undergoing cisplatin treatment , gene expression analysis was performed by the cDNA microarray method . Cell survival and apoptosis induction following treatment were also evaluated . Drug concentrations of 12.5 to 300 muM caused a pronounced reduction in cell survival rates five days after treatment , whereas concentrations higher than 25 muM were effective in reducing the survival rates to However , the maximum apoptosis frequency was 20.4% for 25 muM cisplatin in cells analyzed at 72 h , indicating that apoptosis is not the only kind of cell death induced by cisplatin . An analysis of gene expression revealed 67 significantly ( FDR < 0.05 ) modulated genes : 29 of which down- and 38 up-regulated . These genes belong to several classes ( metabolism , protein localization , cell proliferation , apoptosis , adhesion , stress response , cell cycle and DNA repair ) that may represent several affected cell processes under the influence of cisplatin treatment . The expression pattern of three genes ( RHOA , LIMK2 and TIMP2 ) was confirmed by the real time PCR method .
BACKGROUND Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , a potent regulator of cellular homeostasis , is associated with aggressive tumor behavior . The mechanism by which EGFR inhibition functions is unclear , with controversial results demonstrating an effect on the tumor cells , endothelial cells , or pericytes . EGFR activation has been linked to the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , a known mitogen of angiogenesis , but the relationship between these factors and their effect on tumor vessel development is vague . We hypothesized that using an EGFR inhibitor on a human Ewing's sarcoma model would inhibit tumor growth by suppressing vessel proliferation . METHODS A cell proliferation assay was performed on the Ewing's sarcoma ( SK-NEP-1 ) cell line . Tumor cells were implanted intrarenally in athymic mice . Animals received daily gavage with vehicle or gefitinib 1 wk following implantation . Mice ( n = 12/cohort ) were euthanized 6 wk following implantation . Remaining mice were maintained without treatment for 2 wk . Vascular changes were assessed by angiography and immunohistochemically . EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) expression were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) . RESULTS Gefitinib suppressed in vitro cell growth with an IC(50) = 1.36 muM . Minimal tumor growth suppression was noted at 6 wk ( 6.01 <FFFD> 1.2 g in control versus 4.61 <FFFD> 0.9 g treated , P = 0.36 ) . After cessation of gefitinib , tumor growth was increased in both groups ( 7.37 <FFFD> 1.62 g versus 6.77 <FFFD> 1.53 g , P = 0.79 ) . Microvessel density was unchanged despite EGFR inhibition ( 161,000 <FFFD> 16,000 pixels versus 135,000 <FFFD> 18,000 pixels , P = 0.31 ) . At 6 wk , the vascular maturity index was similar in both groups ( 3.63 <FFFD> 1.12 versus 4.09 <FFFD> 1.71 , P = 0.83 ) . A downward trend in EGFR expression ( 49% of control ) and an upward trend in VEGF levels ( 50% of control ) occurred in the treated group . CONCLUSIONS EGFR expression was suppressed in cultured cells and xenograft tumors . Despite a cytotoxic effect on cell lines , gefitinib had little effect on tumor growth . No effects on the tumor vasculature were noted in the setting of EGFR suppression , suggesting that angiogenesis induced by SK-NEP-1 cells is refractory to EGFR inhibition . Interestingly , the resulting increase in VEGF expression following EGFR blockade , provides an alternative pro-angiogenic pathway promoting tumor survival .
p53 is a crucial tumor suppressor that is mutated or deleted in a majority of cancers . Exactly how p53 prevents tumor progression has proved elusive for many years ; however , this information is crucial to define targets for chemotherapeutic development that can effectively restore p53 function . Bioactive sphingolipids have recently emerged as important regulators of proliferative , apoptotic and senescent cellular processes . In this study , we demonstrate that the enzyme sphingosine kinase 1 ( SK1 ) , a critical enzyme in the regulation of the key bioactive sphingolipids ceramide , sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate ( S1P ) , serves as a key downstream target for p53 action . Our results show that SK1 is proteolysed in response to genotoxic stress in a p53-dependent manner. p53 null mice display elevation of SK1 levels and a tumor-promoting dysregulation of bioactive sphingolipids in which the anti-growth sphingolipid ceramide is decreased and the pro-growth sphingolipid S1P is increased . Importantly , deletion of SK1 in p53 null mice completely abrogated thymic lymphomas in these mice and prolonged their life span by Deletion of SK1 also significantly attenuated the formation of other cancers in p53 heterozygote mice . The mechanism of p53 tumor suppression by loss of SK1 is mediated by elevations of sphingosine and ceramide , which in turn were accompanied by increased expression of cell cycle inhibitors and tumor cell senescence . Thus , targeting SK1 may restore sphingolipid homeostasis in p53-dependent tumors and provide insights into novel therapeutic approaches to cancer .
Identification of the proteins that are associated with estrogen receptor ( ER ) status is a first step towards better understanding of the hormone-dependent nature of breast carcinogenesis . Although a number of gene expression analyses have been conducted , protein complement has not been systematically investigated to date . Because proteins are primary targets of therapeutic drugs , in this study , we have attempted to identify proteomic signatures that demarcate ER-positive and -negative breast cancers . Using highly enriched breast tumor cells , replicate analyses from 3 ERalpha+ and 3 ERalpha- human breast tumors resulted in the identification of 2,995 unique proteins with >=2 peptides . Among these , a number of receptor tyrosine kinases and intracellular kinases that are abundantly expressed in ERalpha+ and ERalpha- breast cancer tissues were identified . Further , label-free quantitative proteome analysis revealed that 236 proteins were differentially expressed in ERalpha+ and ERalpha- breast tumors . Among these , 141 proteins were selectively up-regulated in ERalpha+ , and 95 proteins were selectively up-regulated in ERalpha- breast tumors . Comparison of differentially expressed proteins with a breast cancer database revealed 98 among these have been previously reported to be involved in breast cancer . By Gene Ontology molecular function , dehydrogenase , reductase , cytoskeletal proteins , extracellular matrix , hydrolase , and lyase categories were significantly enriched in ERalpha+ , whereas selected calcium-binding protein , membrane traffic protein , and cytoskeletal protein were enriched in ERalpha- breast tumors . Biological process and pathway analysis revealed that up-regulated proteins of ERalpha+ were overrepresented by proteins involved in amino acid metabolism , proteasome , and fatty acid metabolism , while up-regulated proteins of ERalpha- were overrepresented by proteins involved in glycolysis pathway . The presence and relative abundance of 4 selected differentially abundant proteins ( liprin-alpha1 , fascin , DAP5 , and beta-arrestin-1 ) were quantified and validated by immunohistochemistry . In conclusion , unlike in vitro cell culture models , the in vivo signaling proteins and pathways that we have identified directly from human breast cancer tissues may serve as relevant therapeutic targets for the pharmacological intervention of breast cancer .
Programmed cell death 6 ( PDCD6 ) was originally found as a pro-apoptotic protein , but its molecular mechanism is not well understood . In this study , we have attempted to investigate the effects of PDCD6 on the inhibition of angiogenesis-mediated cell growth as a novel anti-angiogenic protein . Purified recombinant human PDCD6 inhibited cell migration in a concentration-time-dependent manner . We also found that overexpressed PDCD6 suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-induced proliferation , invasion , and capillary-like structure tube formation in vitro . PDCD6 suppressed phosphorylation of signaling regulators downstream from PI3K , including Akt , mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) , glycogen synthase kinase-3beta(GSK-3beta) , ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( p70S6K ) , and also decreased cyclin D1 expression . We found binding PDCD6 to VEGFR-2 , a key player in the PI3K/mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway . Taken together , these data suggest that PDCD6 plays a significant role in modulating cellular angiogenesis .
Glioma tumors are refractory to conventional treatment . Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive type of primary brain tumors in humans . In this study , we introduce oxidative stress-energy depletion ( OSED ) therapy as a new suggested treatment for glioblastoma . OSED utilizes D-amino acid oxidase ( DAO ) , which is a promising therapeutic protein that induces oxidative stress and apoptosis through generating hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) . OSED combines DAO with 3-bromopyruvate ( 3BP ) , a hexokinase II ( HK II ) inhibitor that interferes with Warburg effect , a metabolic alteration of most tumor cells that is characterized by enhanced aerobic glycolysis . Our data revealed that 3BP induced depletion of energetic capabilities of glioma cells. 3BP induced H2O2 production as a novel mechanism of its action . C6 glioma transfected with DAO and treated with D-serine together with 3BP-sensitized glioma cells to 3BP and decreased markedly proliferation , clonogenic power and viability in a three-dimensional tumor model with lesser effect on normal astrocytes . DAO gene therapy using atelocollagen as an in vivo transfection agent proved effective in a glioma tumor model in Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rats , especially after combination with 3BP . OSED treatment was safe and tolerable in SD rats . OSED therapy may be a promising therapeutic modality for glioma .
Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( PAI-1 ) is a serpin protein , a natural inhibitor of urokinase ( uPA ) and tissue plasminogen activators ( tPA ) . By inhibiting uPA it can block growth of the cancer tumors by suppressing angiogenesis , while when acting on tPA in the blood it can avert conversion of plasminogen to plasmin preventing lysis of the clot . Furthermore , blocking PAI-1 activity can protect against thrombosis . Thus PAI-1 makes great impact on human homeostasis and is desirable for clinical application . Wild-type PAI-1 ( wt-PAI-1 ) has a short span of activity with a t1/2 of h , being spontaneously converted into a latent form . An enormous effort has been made to create a more stable molecule with >600 PAI-1 variants constructed to study its structure-function relationship . In the present study , we evaluate the structure of the active recombinant VLHL-PAI-1 ( very long half life , active >700 h ) which is glycosylated similarly to wt-PAI-1 at N232 and N288 , with the extended reactive center loop , intact engineered -S-S-bridge ( Q174C , G323C ) that precludes latency without affecting structure , and can be controlled by a reducing agent to terminate activity at will . We have already proven its usefulness to control cancer in human cancer cells , as well as preventing clot lysis in human whole blood and plasma and in a mouse model . Our results demonstrate the potential therapeutic applications ( topical or systemic ) of this protein in the treatment of cancer , for the trauma patients to ward off an excessive blood loss , or for people with the PAI-1 deficiency , especially during surgery .
Genetic and molecular analyses mainly in Arabidopsis and in some other plants have demonstrated involvement of light signaling in cell cycle regulation . In this report , we show light-mediated activation of the promoter of AtPol\u03bb gene , a homolog of mammalian DNA polymerase \u03bb in Arabidopsis thaliana and an important component of DNA damage repair/recombination machinery in plants . Analyses of the light-mediated promoter activity using various deletion versions of AtPol\u03bb promoter in transformed Arabidopsis and tobacco ( Nicotiana tabaccum ) plants indicate that a 130-bp promoter region between -536 and -408 of AtPol\u03bb promoter is essential for light-induced regulation of AtPol\u03bb expression . DNA-protein interaction studies reveal that an ATCT-motif and AE-box light-responsive elements in the light-regulated promoter region confer light responsiveness of AtPol\u03bb promoter . DNA-binding analysis has identified a 63-kDa trans-acting protein factor which showed specific binding to ATCT-motif , while another trans-acting factor of kDa was found to bind specifically to both ATCT and AE-box sequences . The 52-kDa protein has been identified as B3-domain transcription factor by MALDI-TOF/MS analysis . Overall , our results provide novel information on the role of light signaling in regulation of expression of an important component of DNA repair machinery in plants .
Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor , a widely used drug to treat ulcers and gastroesophageal refluxdisease . We have evaluated colon cancer chemopreventive properties of omeprazole using azoxymethane ( AOM)-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci ( ACF ) in male F344 rats and analyzed cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in human colon cancer cells . Five-week-old male F344 rats were fed a control or experimental diet containing two doses of omeprazole ( 200 and 400ppm ) . After one week , all animals were s.c. injected with AOM ( 15mg/kg body weight , once weekly for two weeks ) . Rats continued on experimental diets for seven more weeks before being sacrificed . Colons were histopathologically evaluated for ACF . Human colon cancer HCT-116 and HCA-7 cells treated with omeprazole were evaluated for different markers associated with proliferation and apoptotic markers using Western blot technique . Rats fed with 200 and 400ppm of omeprazole significantly suppressed total colonic ACF formation ( P<0.001 ) and showed significant suppression of multi-crypt foci ( P<0.05-0.001 ) . Omeprazole produced significant dose-response effects on inhibition of multi-crypt foci ( >=4 ) . Omeprazole treatment in human colon cancer cell lines HCT-116 and HCA-7 cells resulted in induction of p21waf1/cip1 and decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 , Bcl-XL and survivin in a dose-dependent manner . Anticancer properties observed in colon cancer cell lines suggest that omeprazole may induce key signaling molecules of antiproliferation and inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins .
BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the most common liver cancer . Therapeutic results are usually unsatisfactory because liver tumors recur often . Immunologic factors may be related to the recurrence of HCC ; however , this possibility is mentioned only rarely . METHODS Thirty HCC patients undergoing hepatectomies were divided into 3 groups according to the diameters of their HCCs : group A ( n = 8 ) , diameter <=3 cm ; group B ( n = 8 ) , diameter >3 cm and <=5 cm ; and group C ( n = 14 ) , diameter >5 cm . T-lymphocytes from peripheral blood , nontumor liver tissue , and the HCC were analyzed . RESULTS The percentage of CD25+ in the CD4+ T cells did not differ between the peripheral blood and the nontumor liver tissue among the 3 groups . CD25+ cells were increased in the tumor tissue in group C patients ( range , 6-41% ; median , 22.9% ; P = .003 ) , compared to group A patients . The percentage of CD25+ in the CD4+ T cells in tumor tissue was positively correlated with tumor sizes ( r = 0.556 ) . These CD4+ CD25+ lymphocytes produced transforming growth factor-beta and interferon-gamma but not interleukin-10 , and were anergic to plate-coated monoclonal antibodies ( anti-CD3/anti-CD28 ) . The characteristics of these antibodies were comparable to those of regulatory T cells . When the infiltration lymphocytes including CD4+ CD25+ T cells were added to the mixed lymphocyte reaction activated by autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells , the proliferation of lymphocytes was inhibited . CONCLUSION The increase of CD4+ CD25+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment correlates with tumor sizes . These CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells appeared to suppress the immune response activated by dendritic cells .
Thyroid hormone ( T(3) ) mediates cellular growth , development , and differentiation by binding to the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor ( TR ) . Recent studies suggest that long-term hypothyroidism is associated with human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) independent from other major HCC risk factors . Dickkopf ( DKK ) 4 , a secreted protein , antagonizes the Wnt signal pathway . In this study , we demonstrate that T(3) may play a suppressor role by inducing DKK4 expression in HCC cells at both the messenger RNA ( mRNA ) and protein levels . DKK4 was down-regulated in 67.5% of HCC cancerous tissues . The decrease in DKK4 levels was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in TR protein levels in the matched cancerous tissues in 31% of tissues compared by immunoblotting with the adjacent noncancerous tissues . Further , TR and DKK4 expression levels were positively correlated in both normal and cancerous specimens by tissue array analysis . In function assays , stable DKK4 transfected into J7 or HepG2 cells decreased cell invasion in vitro . Conversely , knocking down DKK4 restores cell invasiveness . DKK4-expressing J7 clones showed increased degradation of beta-catenin , but down-regulation of CD44 , cyclin D1 , and c-Jun . To investigate the effect of DKK4 and TR on tumor growth in vivo , we established a xenograft of J7 cells in nude mice . J7-DKK4 and J7-TRalpha1 overexpressing mice , which displayed growth arrest , lower lung colony formation index , and smaller tumor size than in control mice , supporting an inhibitory role of DKK4 in tumor progression . CONCLUSION : Taken together , these data suggest that the TR/DKK4/Wnt/beta-catenin cascade influences the proliferation and migration of hepatoma cells during the metastasis process and support a tumor suppressor role of the TR .
Investigations toward the understanding of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) have been directed , so far , to the study of mechanisms leading to the disease . We believe that understanding why of smokers evade COPD and how this evasion is accomplished might be a fruitful endeavour that could advance knowledge of the development of the disease . Since the inflammatory infiltrate smokers develop seems to be the key element leading to the lung destruction in COPD , the understanding of the possible ways inflammation can be dampened , as well as its consequences , ought to be important . We review here some of the mechanisms by which inflammation is controlled : by the post-translational regulons , by the mechanisms preventing full activation of dendritic cells and by the regulatory T-cells . The potential role of the M2 alveolar macrophage phenotype and the newly described myeloid-derived suppressor cells is mentioned . We also point out that evasion comes at a price , as healthy smokers might be immunosuppressed to some extent and unable to prevent the development of cancer , certainly less so than in severe COPD , where immunity is heightened . Probably , the knowledge of the mechanisms of evasion from COPD could add significantly to the understanding of those leading to the disease .
Breast cancers amplified for the tyrosine kinase receptor Her-2/neu constitute of advanced breast cancer cases , and are characterized by hormone independence and aggressive growth , implicating this pathway in breast oncogenesis . The induction of Her-2/neu leads to tumor development in 60% of transgenic mice . We have previously examined the effects of estrogen in the MMTV-Her-2/neu background by generating the MMTV-Her-2/neu x aromatase double transgenic mouse strain . MMTV-Her-2/neu x aromatase mice developed fewer mammary tumors than the Her-2/neu parental strain . Our present data show the induction of several estrogen-related genes , including the tumor suppressors BRCA1 and p53 , and a decrease in several angiogenic factors . The phosphorylated forms of MAPK p42/44 and AKT were lower in the MMTV-Her-2/neu x aromatase double transgenic mice compared to the MMTV-Her-2/neu parental strain ; conversely , phospho-p38 levels were higher in the double transgenic strain . The ERbeta-selective antagonist THC reversed these changes . The regulation of these factors by ERbeta was confirmed in clones of MCF7 breast cancer cells overexpressing Her-2/neu in combination with ERbeta , suggesting that ERbeta may play a direct role in regulating MAPK and AKT pathways . In summary , the data suggest that ERbeta may play a major role in decreasing tumorigenesis and that it may affect breast cancer cell proliferation and survival by altering MAPK and AKT activation as well as modulation of tumor suppressor and angiogenesis factors . Treatment with selective ERbeta agonist may provide therapeutic advantages for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer .
Uncontrolled estrogen exposure can induce an imbalance in BCL2/BAX expression in endometrial cells , leading to precancerous lesions and type I endometrial adenocarcinoma . This study aimed to explore the mechanism underlying this phenomenon . We show that the activated estrogen receptor can suppress the expression of BAX by upregulating a group of microRNAs including hsa-let-7 family members and hsa-miR-27a , thereby promoting an increased BCL2/BAX ratio as well as enhanced survival and proliferation in the affected cells . These ER-regulated hsa-let-7 microRNAs can be detected in most hyperplastic endometria , suggesting their potential utility as indicators of estrogen over-exposure .
Inflammatory responses and associated products have been implicated in cancer metastasis . However , the relationship between these two processes is uncertain due to the lack of a suitable model . Taking advantage of localized and controllable inflammatory responses induced by biomaterial implantation and the capability of tissue scaffolds to release a wide variety of chemokines , we report a novel system for studying the molecular mechanisms of inflammation-mediated cancer metastasis . The animal model is comprised of an initial subcutaneous implantation of biomaterial microspheres which prompt localized inflammatory responses , followed by the transplantation of metastatic cancer cells into the peritoneal cavity or blood circulation . Histological results demonstrated that substantial numbers of B16F10 cells were recruited to the site nearby biomaterial implants . There was a strong correlation between the degree of biomaterial-mediated inflammatory responses and number of recruited cancer cells . Inflammation-mediated cancer cell migration was inhibited by small molecule inhibitors of CXCR4 but not by neutralizing antibody against CCL21 . Using chemokine-releasing scaffolds , further studies were carried out to explore the possibility of enhancing cancer cell recruitment . Interestingly , erythropoietin ( EPO ) releasing scaffolds , but not stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha-releasing scaffolds , were found to accumulate substantially more melanoma cells than controls . Rather unexpectedly , perhaps by indirectly reducing circulating cancer cells , mice implanted with EPO-releasing scaffolds had longer life span than other groups . These results suggest that chemokine-releasing scaffolds may potentially function as implantable cancer traps and serve as powerful tools for studying cancer distraction and even selective annihilation of circulating metastatic cancer cells .
Nitric oxide ( NO ) shows tumoricidal activity . We had previously reported that NO downregulates the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway , but upregulates the MEK/ERK pathway downstream of growth factor signaling . We hypothesized that NO donor and MEK inhibitor in combination synergistically inhibit the viability of cancer cells compared to either NO donor or MEK inhibitor alone . We determined the effects of S-nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO , NO-donor ) and U0126 ( MEK inhibitor ) on insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) signaling , proliferation and invasion in cancer cell lines . GSNO inhibits phosphorylation of IGF-I receptor ( IGF-IR ) , EGF receptor ( EGFR ) and Akt , but upregulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in MIAPaCa-2 and HCT-116 cells after stimulation by IGF-I and EGF . On the other hand , U0126 inhibits phosphorylation of ERK1/2 , but upregulates phosphorylation of IGF-IR and EGFR in MIAPaCa-2 and HCT-116 cells . The combination of GSNO and U0126 downregulates phosphorylation of IGF-IR , EGFR , Akt and ERK1/2 after stimulation by IGF-I and EGF . GSNO as well as U0126 , inhibits the proliferation of MIAPaCa-2 , HCT-116 , Panc-1 , MCF-7 , HT-29 and AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner . GSNO and U0126 in combination synergistically inhibit proliferation and invasion of cancer cells . These results indicate that the combined treatment of NO donor and MEK inhibitor may be promising in cancer therapy .
Numerous small potentially bioactive peptides are derived from the selective processing of the amino acid secretogranin II ( SgII ) precursor , but only the 31-42 amino acid segment termed secretoneurin ( SN ) is well-conserved from sharks to mammals . Both SNa and SNb paralogs have been identified in some teleosts , likely arising as a result of the specific genome duplication event in this lineage . Only one copy of the putative lamprey SgII ( 188 amino acids ) could be identified which gives rise to a divergent agnathan SN that contains the signature YTPQ-X-LA-X(7)-EL sequence typical of the central core of all known SN peptides . In rodent models , SN has regulatory effects on neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter release , and possesses therapeutic potential for the induction of angiogenesis . The wide distribution of SN in neuroendocrine neurons and pituitary cells suggests important endocrine roles . The clearest example of the endocrine action of SN is the stimulatory effects on pituitary luteinizing hormone release from goldfish pituitary and mouse LbetaT2 gonadotroph cells , indicative of an important role in reproduction . Several lines of evidence suggest that the SN receptor is most likely a G-protein coupled protein . Microarray analysis of SN effects on dispersed goldfish pituitary cells in vitro reveals novel SN actions that include effects on genes involved in notch signaling and the guanylate cyclase pathway . Intracerebroventricular injection of SN increases feeding and locomotory behaviors in goldfish . Given that SgII appeared early in vertebrate evolution , SN is an old peptide with emerging implications as a new multifunctional hormone .
Breast cancer is the malignant neoplasia with the highest incidence in women worldwide . Chronic oxidative stress and inflammation have been indicated as major mediators during carcinogenesis and cancer progression . Human studies have not considered the complexity of tumor biology during the stages of cancer advance , limiting their clinical application . The purpose of this study was to characterize systemic oxidative stress and immune response parameters in early ( ED ; TNM I and II ) and advanced disease ( AD ; TNM III and IV ) of patients diagnosed with infiltrative ductal carcinoma breast cancer . Oxidative stress parameters were evaluated by plasmatic lipoperoxidation , carbonyl content , thiobarbituric reactive substances ( TBARS ) , nitric oxide levels ( NO ) , total radical antioxidant parameter ( TRAP ) , superoxide dismutase , and catalase activities and GSH levels . Immune evaluation was determined by TNF-alpha , IL-1beta , IL-12 , and IL-10 levels and leukocytes oxidative burst evaluation by chemiluminescence . Tissue damage analysis included heart ( total CK and CKMB ) , liver ( AST , ALT , GGT ) , and renal ( creatinine , urea , and uric acid ) plasmatic markers . C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and iron metabolism were also evaluated . Analysis of the results verified different oxidative stress statuses occur at distinct cancer stages . ED was characterized by reduction in catalase , 8-isoprostanes , and GSH levels , with enhanced lipid peroxidation and TBARS levels . AD exhibited more pronounced oxidative status , with reduction in catalase activity and TRAP , intense lipid peroxidation and high levels of NO , TBARs , and carbonyl content . ED patients presented a Th2 immune pattern , while AD exhibited Th1 status . CRP levels and ferritin were increased in both stages of disease . Leukocytes burst impairment was observed in both the groups . Plasma iron levels were significantly elevated in AD . The data obtained indicated that oxidative stress enhancement and immune response impairment may be necessary to ensure cancer progression to advanced stages and may result from both host and tumor inflammatory mediators .
Nowadays , tobacco smoking is the cause of million deaths per year , counting 31% and 6% of all cancer deaths ( affecting 18 different organs ) in middle-aged men and women , respectively . Nicotine is the addictive component of tobacco acting on neuronal nicotinic receptors ( nAChR ) . Functional nAChR , are also present on endothelial , haematological and epithelial cells . Although nicotine itself is regularly not referred to as a carcinogen , there is an ongoing debate whether nicotine functions as a ' tumour promoter ' . Nicotine , with its specific binding to nAChR , deregulates essential biological processes like regulation of cell proliferation , apoptosis , migration , invasion , angiogenesis , inflammation and cell-mediated immunity in a wide variety of cells including foetal ( regulation of development ) , embryonic and adult stem cells , adult tissues as well as cancer cells . Nicotine seems involved in fundamental aspects of the biology of malignant diseases , as well as of neurodegeneration . Investigating the biological effects of nicotine may provide new tools for therapeutic interventions and for the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and tumour biology .
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) is an anti-inflammatory molecule . To study its biologic function in myeloid cells , dominant-negative PPARgamma ( dnPPARgamma ) was overexpressed in a myeloid-specific bitransgenic mouse model . In this bitransgenic system , overexpression of the dnPPARgamma-Flag fusion protein in myeloid-lineage cells abnormally elevated frequencies and total numbers of IL-7Ralpha(-)Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(-) , Lin(-)/Scal(+)/c-Kit(+) , common myeloid , and granulocyte-monocyte progenitor populations in the BM. dnPPARgamma overexpression led to up-regulation of IL-1beta , IL-6 , and TNFalpha in the blood plasma . As a result , CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) cells were systemically increased in association with activation of Stat3 , NF-kappaB , Erk1/2 , and p38 molecules . Myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) inhibited the proliferation and lymphokine production of wild-type CD4+ T cells in vitro . CD4+ T cells from doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice displayed reduced proliferation and lymphokine release . Both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations were decreased in doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice . Multiple forms of carcinoma and sarcoma in the lung , liver , spleen , and lymph nodes were observed in doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice . BM transplantation revealed that a myeloid-autonomous defect was responsible for MDSC expansion , immunosuppression , and tumorigenesis in these mice . These studies suggest that anti-inflammatory PPARgamma in myeloid-lineage cells plays a key role in controlling pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis , MDSC expansion , immunosuppression , and the development of cancer .
Endothelin plays important roles in various physiological functions including vascular constriction . Recent studies reported that the endothelin receptors ETA and ETB are highly expressed in lung and skin tumor tissues . In contrast , there are few reports on endothelin signalling in the proliferation of head and neck cancer . We found that both ETA and ETB endothelin receptors were overexpressed in tumor cells of tongue cancer samples by immunohistochemistry . ETA and ETB were expressed in cultured lingual and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( SCCs ) cell lines . When both cultured cell lines were treated with an ETA selective antagonist ( BQ123 ) or an ETB selective antagonist ( BQ788 ) , inhibition of cell growth was observed . Similar results were observed when SCCs were treated with specific siRNA for the suppression of ETA or ETB . Furthermore , inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase pathway by the treatments with ET receptor antagonists and siRNA was also observed . These results indicate that endothelin signalling may , in part , play important roles in cell growth in SCCs through the MAP kinase pathway .
Pituitary carcinoma occurs in of resected pituitary tumours and carries a poor prognosis ( mean survival <4 years ) , with standard chemotherapy regimens showing limited efficacy . Recent evidence suggests that temozolomide ( TMZ ) , an orally-active alkylating agent used principally in the management of glioblastoma , may also be effective in controlling aggressive/invasive pituitary adenomas/carcinomas . A low level of expression of the DNA-repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) predicts TMZ responsiveness in glioblastomas , and a similar correlation has been observed in the majority of aggressive pituitary adenomas/carcinomas reported to date . Here , we report a case of a silent pituitary corticotroph adenoma , which subsequently re-presented with Cushing's syndrome due to functioning hepatic metastases . The tumour exhibited low immunohistochemical MGMT expression in both primary ( pituitary ) and secondary ( hepatic ) lesions . Initial TMZ therapy ( 200 mg/m(2) for 5 days every 28 days-seven cycles ) resulted in marked clinical , biochemical [ >50% fall in adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH) ] and radiological [ partial RECIST ( response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ) response ] improvements . The patient then underwent bilateral adrenalectomy . However , despite reintroduction of TMZ therapy ( further eight cycles ) ACTH levels plateaued and no further radiological regression was observed . We review the existing literature reporting TMZ efficacy in pituitary corticotroph tumours , and highlight the pointers/lessons for treating aggressive pituitary neoplasia that can be drawn from experience of susceptibility and evolving resistance to TMZ therapy in glioblastoma . Possible strategies for mitigating resistance developing during TMZ treatment of pituitary adenomas/carcinomas are also considered .
Estrogen receptor ( ER ) and NF-kappaB are transcription factors with profound effects on breast cancer cell proliferation and survival . While many studies demonstrate that ER and NF-kappaB can repress each other , we previously identified a gene signature that is synergistically upregulated by these two factors in more aggressive luminal B breast tumors . Herein , we examine a novel mechanism of cross talk between ER and NF-kappaB that results in the upregulation of the antiapoptotic gene BIRC3 ( also known as cIAP2 ) . We demonstrate that NF-kappaB , acting through two response elements , is required for ER recruitment to an adjacent estrogen response element ( ERE ) in the BIRC3 promoter . This effect is accompanied by a major increase in NF-kappaB-dependent histone acetylation around the ERE . Interestingly , CBP , a histone acetyltransferase previously implicated in repressive interactions between ER and NF-kappaB , plays a permissive role by promoting histone acetylation and ER recruitment , as well as enhanced expression of BIRC3 . These findings suggest a new gene regulatory mechanism by which inflammation and NF-kappaB activation can influence ER recruitment to inherently inactive ER binding sites . This fine-tuning mechanism may explain how two factors that generally repress each other's activity may work together on certain genes to promote breast cancer cell survival and tumor progression .
Lanthanide(III) complexes [ Ln(pyphen)(acac)(2)(NO(3)) ] ( 1 , 2 ) , [ Ln(pydppz)(acac)(2)(NO(3)) ] ( 3 , 4 ) and [ La(pydppz)(anacac)(2)(NO(3)) ] ( 5 ) , where Ln is La(III) ( in 1 , 3 , 5 ) and Gd(III) ( in 2 , 4 ) , pyphen is 6-(2-pyridyl)-1,10-phenanthroline , pydppz is 6-(2-pyridyl)-dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine , anacac is anthracenylacetylacetonate and acac is acetylacetonate , were prepared , characterized and their DNA photocleavage activity and photocytotoxicity studied . The crystal structure of complex 2 displays a GdO(6)N(3) coordination . The pydppz complexes 3-5 show an electronic spectral band at nm in DMF . The La(III) complexes are diamagnetic , while the Gd(III) complexes are paramagnetic with seven unpaired electrons . The molar conductivity data suggest 1 : 1 electrolytic nature of the complexes in aqueous DMF . They are avid binders to calf thymus DNA giving K(b) in the range of 5.4 <FFFD> 10(4)-1.2 <FFFD> 10(6) M(-1) . Complexes 3-5 efficiently cleave supercoiled DNA to its nicked circular form in UV-A light of 365 nm via formation of singlet oxygen ( (1)O(2) ) and hydroxyl radical ( HO. ) species . Complexes 3-5 also exhibit significant photocytotoxic effect in HeLa cancer cells giving respective IC(50) value of 0.16(<FFFD>0.01) , 0.15(<FFFD>0.01) and 0.26<FFFD>(0.02) muM in UV-A light of 365 nm , while they are less toxic in dark with an IC(50) value of >3 muM . The presence of an additional pyridyl group makes the pydppz complexes more photocytotoxic than their dppz analogues . FACS analysis of the HeLa cells treated with complex 4 shows apoptosis as the major pathway of cell death . Nuclear localization of complex 5 having an anthracenyl moiety as a fluorophore is evidenced from the confocal microscopic studies .
Amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) altered metabolism , A\u03b2-overproduction/aggregation and oxidative stress are implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology . Based on our previous data indicating that administration of a polyphenol-rich ( PrB ) blueberry extract ( from wild Vaccinium angustifolium ) is memory enhancing in healthy mice and in order to delineate the neuroprotective mechanisms , this study investigated the antioxidant effects of PrB in H\u2082O\u2082-induced oxidative damage , A\u03b2 peptide fibrillogenesis and APP metabolism . PrB suppressed H\u2082O\u2082-initiated oxidation ( DCF assay ) and cell death ( MTT assay ) in SH-SY5Y cells . Protective effects were observed on Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells overexpressing APP770 carrying the mutation Val717Phe only at high concentrations , while further damage on HEK293 cells was induced after co-treatment with 250 microM H\u2082O\u2082 and PrB in comparison with H\u2082O\u2082 alone . Using the thioflavine T assay , blueberry polyphenols inhibited A\u03b2-aggregation ( 15 microg/mL ) in a time-dependent manner , while in the CHO(APP770) cells it had no effect on APP metabolism as assessed by western blot . The results suggest that blueberry polyphenols exhibit antioxidant and/or pro-oxidant properties according to the cellular environment and have no effect on APP metabolism .
Androgen deprivation is currently a standard-of-care , first-line therapy for prostate cancer in the United States . Although this regimen effectively regresses androgen-dependent disease , relapse often occurs in an androgen-independent manner and is associated with poor prognosis . Such castration-resistant prostate cancer represents a major clinical challenge , and the mechanisms underlying castration resistance are not fully understood . Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a key developmental process and has also been implicated in cancer metastasis and therapeutic resistance in recent years . However , the factors contributing to EMT in human cancers remain unclear . Here , we show that both normal mouse prostate tissue and human LuCaP35 prostate tumor explants display an EMT as well as increased stem cell-like features following androgen deprivation . Importantly , we observed similar changes in mesenchymal features in prostate tumors from patients treated with androgen-deprivation therapy . In addition , we have delineated a feedback loop involving the androgen receptor and the Zeb1 transcription factor that seems to mediate this transition . In summary , we show for the first time that androgen deprivation induces EMT in both normal prostate and prostate cancer , revealing a potentially important consequence of a standard-of-care treatment for prostate cancer . This finding could have significant implications for second-line treatment strategies in this clinical setting .
BCL6 is the product of a proto-oncogene implicated in the pathogenesis of human B-cell lymphomas . By binding specific DNA sequences , BCL6 controls the transcription of a variety of genes involved in B-cell development , differentiation and activation . BCL6 is overexpressed in the majority of patients with aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , the most common lymphoma in adulthood , and transgenic mice constitutively expressing BCL6 in B cells develop DLBCLs similar to the human disease . In many DLBCL patients , BCL6 overexpression is achieved through translocation ( or hypermutation of its promoter ( However , many other DLBCLs overexpress BCL6 through an unknown mechanism . Here we show that BCL6 is targeted for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation by a SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein ( SCF ) ubiquitin ligase complex that contains the orphan F-box protein FBXO11 ( refs 5 , 6 ) . The gene encoding FBXO11 was found to be deleted or mutated in multiple DLBCL cell lines , and this inactivation of FBXO11 correlated with increased levels and stability of BCL6 . Similarly , FBXO11 was either deleted or mutated in primary DLBCLs . Notably , tumour-derived FBXO11 mutants displayed an impaired ability to induce BCL6 degradation . Reconstitution of FBXO11 expression in FBXO11-deleted DLBCL cells promoted BCL6 ubiquitylation and degradation , inhibited cell proliferation , and induced cell death . FBXO11-deleted DLBCL cells generated tumours in immunodeficient mice , and the tumorigenicity was suppressed by FBXO11 reconstitution . We reveal a molecular mechanism controlling BCL6 stability and propose that mutations and deletions in FBXO11 contribute to lymphomagenesis through BCL6 stabilization . The deletions/mutations found in DLBCLs are largely monoallelic , indicating that FBXO11 is a haplo-insufficient tumour suppressor gene .
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor . Recent studies have reported the anti-tumor effects of the AhR in breast cancer . In this study , we investigated the anti-tumor effect of AhR activation based on the cancer stem cell hypothesis . We show that AhR activation suppressed mammosphere formation of MCF-7 cells and decreased the proportion of cells with high ALDH-1 ( aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 ) activity . In addition , we also demonstrate that AhR activation regulates self-renewal signaling by down-regulating Wnt/beta-catenin and Notch .
In cancer cells , the aberrant conversion of pyruvate into lactate instead of acetyl-CoA in the presence of oxygen is known as the Warburg effect . The consequences and mechanisms of this metabolic peculiarity are incompletely understood . Here we report that p53 status is a key determinant of the Warburg effect . Wild-type p53 expression decreased levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-2 ( Pdk2 ) and the product of its activity , the inactive form of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ( P-Pdc ) , both of which are key regulators of pyruvate metabolism . Decreased levels of Pdk2 and P-Pdc in turn promoted conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA instead of lactate . Thus , wild-type p53 limited lactate production in cancer cells unless Pdk2 could be elevated . Together , our results established that wild-type p53 prevents manifestation of the Warburg effect by controlling Pdk2 . These findings elucidate a new mechanism by which p53 suppresses tumorigenesis acting at the level of cancer cell metabolism .
D-type cyclins play a pivotal role in G(1)-S progression of the cell cycle , and their expression is frequently deregulated in cancer . Cyclin D1 has a half-life of only min as a result of its ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation , with various F-box proteins , including Fbxo4 , Fbxw8 , Skp2 , and Fbxo31 , having been found to contribute to its ubiquitylation . We have now generated Fbxo4-deficient mice and found no abnormalities in these animals . Cyclin D1 accumulation was thus not observed in Fbxo4(-/-) mouse tissues . The half-life of cyclin D1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) prepared from Fbxo4(-/-) , Fbxw8(-/-) , and Fbxo4(-/-) ; Fbxw8(-/-) mice also did not differ from that in wild-type MEFs . Additional depletion of Skp2 and Fbxo31 in Fbxo4(-/-) ; Fbxw8(-/-) MEFs by RNA interference did not affect cyclin D1 stability . Although Fbxo31 depletion in MEFs increased cyclin D1 abundance , this effect appeared attributable to upregulation of cyclin D1 mRNA . Furthermore , abrogation of the function of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein ( SCF ) complex or the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome ( APC/C ) complexes did not alter the half-life of cyclin D1 , whereas cyclin D1 degradation was dependent largely on proteasome activity . Our genetic analyses thus do not support a role for any of the four F-box proteins examined in cyclin D1 degradation during normal cell cycle progression . They suggest the existence of other ubiquitin ligases that target cyclin D1 for proteolysis .
Previous studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs ) enhance cell survival through upregulation and secretion of stanniocalcin-1 ( STC1 ) . This study shows that MSC-derived STC1 promotes survival of lung cancer cells by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation , reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , and shifting metabolism towards a more glycolytic metabolic profile . MSC-derived STC1 upregulated uncoupling protein 2 ( UCP2 ) in injured A549 cells in an STC1-dependent manner . Knockdown of UCP2 reduced the ability of MSCs and recombinant STC1 ( rSTC1 ) to reduce cell death in the A549 population. rSTC1-treated A549 cells displayed decreased levels of ROS , mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP ) , and increased lactate production , all of which were dependent on the upregulation of UCP2 . Our data suggest that MSCs can promote cell survival by regulating mitochondrial respiration via STC1 .
OBJECTIVE The HER2 receptor is involved in pathways essential for cell proliferation , and is an important predictive and prognostic factor in breast cancer . HER2 probably plays a critical role in many types of cancer , including urothelial carcinoma of the bladder ( UCB ) . Stage T1 UCB exhibits heterogeneous clinical behaviour , and the frequency of HER2 expression in such disease has not been thoroughly examined . The aim of this study was to use an immunohistochemical technique to evaluate the frequency of HER2 expression in a defined population-based cohort of patients registered as having primary stage T1 UCB . MATERIAL AND METHODS The initial study population comprised 285 patients registered as having primary stage T1 UCB . The original histological specimens were re-evaluated with regard to T stage and World Health Organization grade . Hospital records provided information on tumour size , multiplicity , possible presence of histologically proven recurrence and progression . The patients were followed for at least 5 years or until death . In tumours still considered stage T1 after re-evaluation , HER2 was investigated by immunohistochemistry of paraffin-embedded material and scored according to the guidelines used in breast cancer . RESULTS After histopathological re-evaluation , 201 patients were still T1 UCB and could be investigated regarding HER2 expression . HER2 overexpression was observed in 25 of those patients ( 12.4% ) . HER2 status was not significantly associated with recurrence or progression . CONCLUSIONS HER2 was overexpressed in 12.4% of the present cohort of patients with primary stage T1 UCB . There was no significant association between tumour HER2 status and prognosis .
Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR-TKIs ) show dramatic antitumor activity in a subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have an active mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene . On the other hand , some lung cancer patients with wild type EGFR also respond to EGFR-TKIs , suggesting that EGFR-TKIs have an effect on host cells as well as tumor cells . However , the effect of EGFR-TKIs on host microenvironments is largely unknown . A multiple organ metastasis model was previously established in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient mice using human lung cancer cells . This model was used to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of erlotinib , an EGFR-TKI , on multiple organ metastases induced by human small cell lung cancer cells ( SBC-5 cells ) that did not express EGFR . Although erlotinib did not have any effect on the proliferation of SBC-5 cells in vitro , it significantly suppressed bone and lung metastases in vivo , but not liver metastases . An immunohistochemical analysis revealed that , erlotinib significantly suppressed the number of osteoclasts in bone metastases , whereas no difference was seen in microvessel density . Moreover , erlotinib inhibited EGF-induced receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B expression in an osteoblastic cell line ( MC3T3-E1 cells ) . These results strongly suggested that erlotinib prevented bone metastases by affecting host microenvironments irrespective of its direct effect on tumor cells .
Prostate apoptosis response 4 ( Par-4 ) is a ubiquitously expressed proapoptotic tumor suppressor protein . Here , we show for the first time , that Par-4 is a novel substrate of caspase-3 during apoptosis . We found that Par-4 is cleaved during cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human normal and cancer cell lines . Par-4 cleavage generates a C-terminal fragment of kDa , and the cleavage of Par-4 is completely inhibited by a caspase-3 inhibitor , suggesting that caspase-3 is directly involved in the cleavage of Par-4 . Caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells do not show Par-4 cleavage in response to cisplatin treatment , and restoration of caspase-3 in MCF-7 cells produces a decrease in Par-4 levels , with the appearance of a cleaved fragment . Additionally , knockdown of Par-4 reduces caspase-3 activation and apoptosis induction . Site-directed mutagenesis reveals that Par-4 cleavage by caspase-3 occurs at an unconventional site , EEPD(131)vG . Interestingly , overexpression of wild-type Par-4 but not the Par-4 D131A mutant sensitizes cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis . Upon caspase-3 cleavage , the cleaved fragment of Par-4 accumulates in the nucleus and displays increased apoptotic activity . Overexpression of the cleaved fragment of Par-4 inhibits IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and blocks NF-kappaB nuclear translocation . We have identified a novel specific caspase-3 cleavage site in Par-4 , and the cleaved fragment of Par-4 retains proapoptotic activity .
Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) is a key signaling molecule in the elaboration of the inflammatory response . Data indicate that curcumin , a natural ingredient of the curry spice turmeric , acts as a NF-kappaB inhibitor and exhibits both anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties . Curcumin analogs with enhanced activity on NF-kappaB and other inflammatory signaling pathways have been developed including the synthetic monoketone compound 3,5-Bis(2-fluorobenzylidene)-4-piperidone ( EF24). 3,5-Bis(2-pyridinylmethylidene)-4-piperidone ( EF31 ) is a structurally-related curcumin analog whose potency for NF-kappaB inhibition has yet to be determined . To examine the activity of EF31 compared to EF24 and curcumin , mouse RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with EF31 , EF24 , curcumin ( 1-100 muM ) or vehicle ( DMSO 1% ) for 1h . NF-kappaB pathway activity was assessed following treatment with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( 1 mug/mL ) . EF31 ( IC(50) muM ) exhibited significantly more potent inhibition of LPS-induced NF-kappaB DNA binding compared to both EF24 ( IC(50) muM ) and curcumin ( IC(50) >50 muM ) . In addition , EF31 exhibited greater inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation as well as the induction of downstream inflammatory mediators including pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA and protein ( tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin-1beta , and interleukin-6 ) . Regarding the mechanism of these effects on NF-kappaB , EF31 ( IC(50) muM ) exhibited significantly greater inhibition of IkappaB kinase beta compared to EF24 ( IC(50) muM ) . Finally , EF31 demonstrated potent toxicity in NF-kappaB-dependent cancer cell lines while having minimal and reversible toxicity in RAW264.7 macrophages . These data indicate that EF31 is a more potent inhibitor of NF-kappaB activity than either EF24 or curcumin while exhibiting both anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities . Thus , EF31 represents a promising curcumin analog for further therapeutic development .
The innate immune response involves a variety of inflammatory reactions that can result in inflammatory disease and cancer if they are not resolved and instead are allowed to persist . The effective activation and resolution of innate immune responses relies on the production and posttranscriptional regulation of mRNAs encoding inflammatory effector proteins . The RNA-binding protein HuR binds to and regulates such mRNAs , but its exact role in inflammation remains unclear . Here we show that HuR maintains inflammatory homeostasis by controlling macrophage plasticity and migration . Mice lacking HuR in myeloid-lineage cells , which include many of the cells of the innate immune system , displayed enhanced sensitivity to endotoxemia , rapid progression of chemical-induced colitis , and severe susceptibility to colitis-associated cancer . The myeloid cell-specific HuR-deficient mice had an exacerbated inflammatory cytokine profile and showed enhanced CCR2-mediated macrophage chemotaxis . At the molecular level , activated macrophages from these mice showed enhancements in the use of inflammatory mRNAs ( including Tnf , Tgfb , Il10 , Ccr2 , and Ccl2 ) due to a lack of inhibitory effects on their inducible translation and/or stability . Conversely , myeloid overexpression of HuR induced posttranscriptional silencing , reduced inflammatory profiles , and protected mice from colitis and cancer . Our results highlight the role of HuR as a homeostatic coordinator of mRNAs that encode molecules that guide innate inflammatory effects and demonstrate the potential of harnessing the effects of HuR for clinical benefit against pathologic inflammation and cancer .
Primary charge separation dynamics in the reaction center ( RC ) of purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides and its P870 heterodimer mutants have been studied using femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy with 20 and 40fs excitation at 870nm at 293K . Absorbance increase in the 1060-1130nm region that is presumably attributed to P(A)(\u03b4+) cation radical molecule as a part of mixed state with a charge transfer character P*(P(A)(\u03b4+)P(B)(\u03b4-)) was found . This state appears at 120-180fs time delay in the wild type RC and even faster in H(L173)L and H(M202)L heterodimer mutants and precedes electron transfer ( ET ) to B(A) bacteriochlorophyll with absorption band at 1020nm in WT . The formation of the P(A)(\u03b4+)B(A)(\u03b4-) state is a result of the electron transfer from P*(P(A)(\u03b4+)P(B)(\u03b4-)) to the primary electron acceptor B(A) ( still mixed with P* ) with the apparent time delay of Next step of ET is accompanied by the 3-ps appearance of bacteriopheophytin a(-) ( H(A)(-) ) band at 960nm . The study of the wave packet formation upon 20-fs illumination has shown that the vibration energy of the wave packet promotes reversible overcoming of an energy barrier between two potential energy surfaces P* and P*(P(A)(\u03b4+)B(A)(\u03b4-)) at For longer excitation pulses ( 40fs ) this promotion is absent and tunneling through an energy barrier takes about 3ps . This article is part of a Special Issue entitled : Photosynthesis Research for Sustainability : from Natural to Artificial .
In aqueous media , photochemical excitation to S(1) of 3-phenylphenols 4-8 leads to deprotonation of the phenol OH , coupled with protonation of the benzyl alcohol and overall dehydration that delivers zwitterions 17-21 . The zwitterions react with nucleophiles ( CH(3)OH , CF(3)CH(2)OH and ethanolamine ) converting them in high quantum yields to the corresponding adducts and photosolvolysis products ( for photomethanolysis \u03a6 Zwitterions 20 and 21 were characterized by laser flash photolysis in CH(3)CN-H(2)O ( \u03c4 and 25 \u03bcs , respectively ) and the associated quenching rate constants with nucleophiles azide and ethanolamine determined . In vitro studies of antiproliferative activity of the photochemicaly generated QMs and zwitterions formed from 2- , 3- and 4-phenylphenols were carried out on three human cancer cell lines HCT 116 ( colon ) , MCF-7 ( breast ) , and H 460 ( lung ) . Irradiation of cells incubated with 3 , 6 , and 26 showed enhanced antiproliferative activity compared to the cells that were not irradiated .
The PML protein and PML nuclear bodies ( PML-NB ) are implicated in multiple cellular functions relevant to tumor suppression , including DNA damage response . In most cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia , the PML and retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RARA ) genes are translocated , resulting in expression of oncogenic PML-RAR\u03b1 fusion proteins . PML-NB fail to form normally , and promyelocytes remain in an undifferentiated , abnormally proliferative state . We examined the involvement of PML protein and PML-NB in homologous recombinational repair ( HRR ) of chromosomal DNA double-strand breaks . Transient overexpression of wild-type PML protein isoforms produced hugely enlarged or aggregated PML-NB and reduced HRR by suggesting that HRR depends to some extent upon normal PML-NB structure . Knockdown of PML by RNA interference sharply attenuated formation of PML-NB and reduced HRR by up to 20-fold . However , PML-knockdown cells showed apparently normal induction of H2AX phosphorylation and RAD51 foci after DNA damage by ionizing radiation . These findings indicate that early steps in HRR , including recognition of DNA double-strand breaks , initial processing of ends , and assembly of single-stranded DNA/RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments , do not depend upon PML-NB . The HRR deficit in PML-depleted cells thus reflects inhibition of later steps in the repair pathway . Expression of PML-RAR\u03b1 fusion proteins disrupted PML-NB structure and reduced HRR by up to 10-fold , raising the possibility that defective HRR and resulting genomic instability may figure in the pathogenesis , progression and relapse of acute promyelocytic leukemia .
Radiation combined with chemotherapy ( neo-CRT ) is increasingly the standard of care for the treatment of esophageal cancer , either as neoadjuvant therapy in multimodal protocols or as primary therapy . Unfortunately , of patients demonstrate little or no response to neo-CRT . Accordingly , understanding the molecular mechanisms of resistance to therapy may underpin significant advances through the identification of nonresponders either before or early in treatment . We previously identified the RNPC1 gene , which is important in stabilizing p21 , as being upregulated in the tumors of esophageal cancer patients who had a poor response to neo-CRT . We hypothesize that RNPC1 contributes to resistance to radiation therapy through a p21-mediated cell cycle accumulation/arrest mechanism . Analysis revealed that p53 and RNPC1 expression were highest in the JH-EsoAd1 cell line and lowest in OE19 cells . This was associated with accumulation of cells in G0/G1. p21 expression , which was highest in OE19 cells and lowest in OE33 cells , was associated with relative intrinsic sensitivity to radiation . OE33 cells were transfected with a plasmid ( pCMV6-AC-GFP ) encoding a C-terminal GFP-tagged RNPC1 , and overexpression was confirmed by qPCR and fluorescence microscopy . Overexpression of RNPC1-GFP resulted in significantly increased levels of the p21 transcript and protein through a direct physical interaction between the RNPC1 protein and the p21 transcript . Furthermore , RNPC1 overexpression led to significant G0/G1 cell cycle accumulation and significantly enhanced cellular resistance to radiation . We conclude that RNPC1 contributes to tumor resistance to radiotherapy , which likely occurs through a p21-mediated G0/G1 accumulation mechanism . Therefore , RNPC1 may represent a potential therapeutic target for enhancing tumor sensitivity to radiation .
BACKGROUND The receptor tyrosine kinase family includes many transmembrane proteins with diverse physiological and pathophysiological functions . The involvement of tyrosine kinase signaling in promoting a more aggressive tumor phenotype within the context of chemotherapeutic evasion is gaining recognition . The Ron receptor is a tyrosine kinase receptor that has been implicated in the progression of breast cancer and evasion of tamoxifen therapy . RESULTS Here , we report that Ron expression is correlated with in situ , estrogen receptor alpha ( ERalpha)-positive tumors , and is higher in breast tumors following neoadjuvant tamoxifen therapy . We also demonstrate that the majority of mammary tumors isolated from transgenic mice with mammary specific-Ron overexpression ( MMTV-Ron mice ) , exhibit appreciable ER expression . Moreover , genetic-ablation of ERalpha , in the context of Ron overexpression , leads to delayed mammary tumor initiation and growth , but also results in an increased metastasis . CONCLUSIONS Ron receptor overexpression is associated with ERalpha-positive human and murine breast tumors . In addition , loss of ERalpha on a Ron overexpressing background in mice leads to the development of breast tumors which grow slower but which exhibit more metastasis and suggests that targeting of ERalpha , as in the case of tamoxifen therapy , may reduce the growth of Ron overexpressing breast cancers but may cause these tumors to be more metastatic .
Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) results from a chromosomal translocation in hematopoietic stem or early progenitor cells that gives rise to the oncogenic BCR/ABL fusion protein . Clinically , CML has a chronic phase that eventually evolves into an accelerated stage and blast crisis . A CML-specific immune response is thought to contribute to the control of disease . Whether the immune system can also promote disease progression is not known . In the present study , we investigated the possibility that the TNF receptor family member CD27 is present on leukemia stem cells ( LSCs ) and mediates effects of the immune system on CML . In a mouse model of CML , BCR/ABL+ LSCs and leukemia progenitor cells were found to express CD27 . Binding of CD27 by its ligand , CD70 , increased expression of Wnt target genes in LSCs by enhancing nuclear localization of active beta-catenin and TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase ( TNIK ) . This resulted in increased proliferation and differentiation of LSCs . Blocking CD27 signaling in LSCs delayed disease progression and prolonged survival . Furthermore , CD27 was expressed on CML stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow of CML patients , and CD27 signaling promoted growth of BCR/ABL+ human leukemia cells by activating the Wnt pathway . Since expression of CD70 is limited to activated lymphocytes and dendritic cells , our results reveal a mechanism by which adaptive immunity contributes to leukemia progression . In addition , targeting CD27 on LSCs may represent an attractive therapeutic approach to blocking the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in CML .
The DNA damage response ( DDR ) cascade and ROS ( reactive oxygen species ) signaling are both involved in the induction of cell death after DNA damage , but a mechanistic link between these two pathways has not been clearly elucidated . This study demonstrates that ROS induction after treatment of cells with neocarzinostatin ( NCS ) , an ionizing radiation mimetic , is at least partly mediated by increasing histone H2AX . Increased levels of ROS and cell death induced by H2AX overexpression alone or DNA damage leading to H2AX accumulation are reduced by treating cells with the antioxidant N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine ( NAC ) , the NADP(H) oxidase ( Nox ) inhibitor DPI , expression of Rac1N17 , and knockdown of Nox1 , but not Nox4 , indicating that induction of ROS by H2AX is mediated through Nox1 and Rac1 GTPase . H2AX increases Nox1 activity partly by reducing the interaction between a Nox1 activator NOXA1 and its inhibitor 14-3-3zeta . These results point to a novel role of histone H2AX that regulates Nox1-mediated ROS generation after DNA damage .
Hypoxic events frequently occur in the aquatic environment in association with micro pollutants , including heavy metals . Only a few studies are however available on the uptake and biological responses of heavy metals under hypoxic conditions . To elucidate the phenomenon , mirror carp Cyprinus carpio L . ( 16.13-16.22 g ) were exposed chronically to dietary copper ( Cu ; 250 and 500 mg kg dry wt.(-1) ) for 30 d under normoxic ( 8.25 mg O(2) L(-1) ) and hypoxic ( mg O(2) L(-1) ) conditions and adopting an integrated approach , sub-lethal biomarker responses were determined at different levels of biological organisation . Level of oxidative DNA damage ( as determined by modified Comet assay ) showed strong significant difference following exposure to dietary Cu level under normoxic ( 1.6-fold ) as well as under hypoxic condition at both Cu levels ( 2.1 and 2.5-folds respectively ) . Significant difference was also observed for haematological parameters ( i.e. increased red and white blood cells , haematocrit value and haemoglobin concentration ) . Quantitative histology revealed alterations in tissues ( i.e. liver and gills ) for hypoxic and all dietary Cu treatment groups under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions suggesting a compensatory response to these organs ( p<0.05 ) . The order of Cu accumulation in tissues ( as determined by ICP-OES ) was liver>intestine>kidney>gill . Interestingly , SGR under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions reduced with elevating Cu levels ( p=0.019 ) . Overall , the results provide evidence for enhanced toxicological responses in fish following exposure to Cu either alone or in combination with hypoxic condition and lends support to the evolving viewpoint that many water quality guidelines should be revisited in terms of new ecotoxicological criteria .
Hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) is an organochlorine pesticide that acts as an endocrine disruptor in humans and rodents . The development of breast cancer strongly depends on endocrine conditions modulated by environmental factors . We have demonstrated that HCB is a tumor co-carcinogen in rats and an inducer of proliferation in MCF-7 cells , in an estrogen receptor alpha ( ERalpha)-dependent manner , and of migration in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line . In the present study , we examined HCB effect on c-Src/human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER1 ) and ERalpha signaling pathways in mammary glands and in N-nitroso-N-methylurea ( NMU)-induced mammary tumors in rats . Furthermore , we evaluated histopathological changes and serum hormone levels . Rats were separated into four groups : control , HCB ( 100 mg/kg b.w. ) , NMU ( 50 mg/kg b.w. ) and NMU-HCB . Our data show that HCB increases c-Src and HER1 activation , c-Src/HER1 association , and Y699-STAT5b and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in mammary glands . HCB also enhances Y537-ERalpha phosphorylation and ERalpha/c-Src physical interaction . In tumors , HCB also induces c-Src and HER1 activation , c-Src/HER1 association , as well as T308-Akt and Y699-STAT5b phosphorylation . In addition , the pesticide increases ERalpha protein content and decreases p-Y537-ERalpha levels and ERalpha/c-Src association in tumors . HCB increases serum 17-beta estradiol and prolactin contents and decreases progesterone , FSH and LH levels in rats without tumors , while the opposite effect was observed in rats with tumors . Taken together , our results indicate that HCB induces an estrogenic effect in mammary gland , increasing c-Src/HER1 and ERalpha signaling pathways . HCB stimulates c-Src/HER1 pathway , but decreases ERalpha activity in tumors , appearing to shift them towards a higher malignancy phenotype .
DNA repair is essential in maintaining genome integrity and defects in different steps of the process have been linked to cancer and aging . It is a long lasting question how DNA repair is spatially and temporarily organized in the highly compartmentalized nucleus and whether the diverse nuclear compartments regulate differently the efficiency of repair . Increasing evidence suggest the involvement of nuclear pore complexes in repair of double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) in yeast . Here , we show that the human nucleoporin 153 ( NUP153 ) has a role in repair of DSBs and in the activation of DNA damage checkpoints . We explore the mechanism of action of NUP153 and we propose its potential as a novel therapeutic target in cancers .
The cytotoxicities of highly efficient salan-Ti(IV) complexes toward a range of cell lines , including drug-resistant cells , are reported along with preliminary mechanistic insights . Five salan-Ti(IV) complexes were investigated toward eight different human and murine cancer-derived cell lines , including colon , ovarian , lung , cervical , pancreatic , leukemic , skin , and breast . The salan complexes are more active toward the cells analyzed than cisplatin and the known titanium compound ( bzac)(2 ) Ti(OiPr)(2) , and no cell line resistant to the salan complexes was identified . Moreover , the salan-Ti(IV) complexes are highly active toward both cisplatin-sensitive ( A2780 ) and cisplatin-resistant ( A2780CisR ) human ovarian cancer cell lines . Similarly , the salan complexes are cytotoxic toward multi-drug-resistant ( ABCB1-expressing ) mouse lymphoma cell lines HU-1 and HU-2 . Importantly , minimal or no activity was observed toward primary murine cells ( bone marrow , heart , liver , kidney , spleen , and lung ) , supporting selectivity for cancer cells . Additionally , the salan complexes maintain high cytotoxicity for up to 24 h following exposure to cell culture medium , whereas reference complexes ( bzac)(2 ) Ti(OiPr)(2) and Cp(2) TiCl(2) rapidly lose much of their activity upon exposure to medium , within h . The upregulation of p53 followed by cell-cycle arrest in G(1) phase is likely one mechanism of action of the salan complexes . Taken together , the results indicate that these compounds are selectively toxic to cancer cells and are able to circumvent two independent mechanisms of drug resistance , thus expanding the scope of their potential medicinal utility .
The aim of the present study was to investigate whether CBSCs [ (umbilical) cord blood stem cells ] can be a new source of DCs ( dendritic cells ) , which can generate more potent antigen-specific immune responses and anti-tumour effects . CBSCs and PBMCs ( peripheral blood mononuclear cells ) were collected , cultured and differentiated into DCs . Surface markers , secreting cytokines , antigen-presentation activity , antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity and cytotoxic killing effects induced by these two DC origins were evaluated and compared . CBSCs were expanded by ex vivo culture . The expression of surface markers in CBSC-derived DCs were higher than those in PBMC-derived DCs treated with LPS ( lipopolysaccharide ) . The CBSC-derived DCs mainly secreted IL ( interleukin)-6 , IL-10 and TNF ( tumour necrosis factor)-alpha , whereas PBMC-derived DCs mainly secreted IL-5 and IFN ( interferon)-gamma . The CBSC-derived DCs had better antigen-presentation abilities when stimulated with LPS or TNF-alpha , induced higher numbers of IFN-gamma-secreting antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells , as assessed using an ELISpot ( enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot ) assay , and stimulated more potent antigen-specific CTL ( cytotoxic T-cell ) activities ( P<0.01 , one-way ANOVA ) . CBSC-derived DCs had quicker and greater ERK ( extracellular-signal-regulated kinase ) and Akt phosphorylation , and weaker p38 phosphorylation , than PBMC-derived DCs when stimulated with LPS . In conclusion , CBSC-derived DCs have the ability to induce stronger antigen-specific immunity and more potent anti-tumour effects and therefore could be a good source of DCs for use in DC-based cancer vaccines and immunotherapy .
The ATM kinase and p53 are key tumor suppressor factors that control the genotoxic stress response pathway . The ATM substrate Mdm2 controls p53 activity by either targeting p53 for degradation or promoting its synthesis by binding the p53 mRNA . The physiological role and regulation of Mdm2's dual function toward p53 is not known . Here we show that ATM-dependent phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser395 is required for the p53 mRNA-Mdm2 interaction . This event also promotes SUMO-conjugation of Mdm2 and its nucleoli accumulation . Interfering with the p53 mRNA-Mdm2 interaction prevents p53 stabilization and activation following DNA damage . These results demonstrate how ATM activity switches Mdm2 from a negative to a positive regulator of p53 via the p53 mRNA .
G-quadruplex structures are an attractive target for the development of anticancer drugs , as their formation in human telomere induces a DNA damage response followed by apoptosis in cancer cells . However , the development of new anticancer drugs by means of structural-based drug design is hampered by a lack of accurate information on the exact G-quadruplex conformation adopted by the human telomeric DNA under physiological conditions . Several groups reported that , in a molecular crowded , cell-like environment , simulated by polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , the human telomeric DNA adopts the parallel G-quadruplex conformation . These studies have suggested that 40% ( w/v ) PEG concentration induces complete structural conversion from the other known human telomeric G-quadruplex conformations to the parallel G-quadruplex , thus simplifying the high structural polymorphism existing in the absence of PEG . In this study , we demonstrate that the structural conversion to the parallel G-quadruplex is not a complete reaction at physiological temperature . We report a complete kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of the conformational transitions involving the ( TTAGGG)(4)TT and ( TTAGGG)(8)TT human telomeric DNA sequences in K(+) solution containing PEG . Our data show that the hybrid-type and parallel conformations coexist at equilibrium in the presence of PEG at physiological temperature and the degree of the quadruplex interconversion depends on the PEG molecular weight . Further , we find that telomeric DNA folds in the parallel quadruplex in the seconds time scale , a much larger time scale than the one reported for the hybrid quadruplex folding ( The whole of our data allow us to predict the relative amount of each G-quadruplex conformation as a function of temperature and time . The effect of other crowding agents like Ficoll 400 and glycerol on the quadruplex interconversion has been also explored .
Prolactin ( PRL ) promotes the proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells in part via the transactivation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) , also known as Neu in rodents . A PRL receptor ( PRLR ) antagonist , G129R , has been developed , which indirectly inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 ( p-HER2 ) in human breast cancer cell lines . In this study , we investigate the effects of cancer-associated fibroblasts ( CAFs ) upon this molecular cross-talk using tumor cells and CAFs derived from spontaneous mammary tumors of female MMTV-neu transgenic mice . Tumors were resected and cultured as small tumor chunks ( mm3 ) or were cultured in monolayer . G129R reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu ( p-Neu ) in a dose-dependent manner ( IC50 mug/ml ) in tumor chunks , but had no effect on primary tumor epithelial cells grown in monolayer . Direct co-culture of mouse or human tumor epithelial cell lines with CAFs restored the epithelial cells ' response to G129R , similar to that observed in mouse tumor chunks . The addition of PRL , as expected , induced p-Neu in both the tumor chunk and co-culture models . The inhibitory effect of G129R was absent when CAFs were physically separated from mouse tumor epithelial cells using a transwell system , or when CAFs were replaced with normal fibroblasts in direct co-culture with human or mouse tumor epithelial cells . In vivo , G129R reduced p-Neu levels in primary mammary tumors of mice in a time- and dose-dependent manner . In conclusion , CAFs play a critical role in bridging the cross-talk between PRL and HER2/Neu in both mouse and human models of breast cancer . The inhibitory effects of G129R on p-Neu and on tumor growth are dependent upon interactions of tumor epithelial cells with CAFs .
This study shows the effect of pterostilbene on intracellular neutral lipid accumulation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells leading to growth arrest and autophagy . On exposing the breast cancer cells with 30 muM pterostilbene for 72 h there was almost 2-folds increase in neutral lipids and triglycerides . Also the phytochemical caused a 4-folds increase in the expression of adipogenic differentiation marker c/EBPalpha . Further , pterostilbene inhibited 3beta-hydroxylsterol-Delta(7)-reductase , the enzyme which catalyzes the last step conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol , and thereby causes the intracellular accumulation of the former sterol . These results were associated with over-expression of oxysterol binding protein homologue and liver X receptor ( LXR ) by Pterostilbene also caused a simultaneous increase in the expression autophagic marker proteins Beclin 1 and LC3 II ( microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 ) by approximately 6-folds , which leads to an alternative pathway of autophagy . These effects were observed in association with the loss of mitotic and metastatic potential of MCF-7 cells which was abolished in the presence of catalase ( ROS scavenger ) or 3MA ( autophagic inhibitor ) . Thus the present data shows that the long term exposure to pterostilbene causes growth arrest in MCF-7 cells which may be due to differentiation of the mammary carcinoma cells into normal epithelial cell like morphology and activation of autophagy .
Cancer cells universally increase glucose and glutamine consumption , leading to the altered metabolic state known as the Warburg effect ; one metabolic pathway , highly dependent on glucose and glutamine , is the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway . Increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway leads to increases in the post-translational addition of O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine ( O-GlcNAc ) to various nuclear and cytosolic proteins . A number of these target proteins are implicated in cancer , and recently , O-GlcNAcylation was shown to play a role in breast cancer ; however , O-GlcNAcylation in other cancers remains poorly defined . Here , we show that O-GlcNAc transferase ( OGT ) is overexpressed in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate epithelium and that OGT protein and O-GlcNAc levels are elevated in prostate carcinoma cell lines . Reducing O-GlcNAcylation in PC3-ML cells was associated with reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-2 , MMP-9 , and VEGF , resulting in inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis . OGT-mediated regulation of invasion and angiogenesis was dependent upon regulation of the oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1 , a key regulator of invasion and angiogenesis , as reducing OGT expression led to increased FoxM1 protein degradation . Conversely , overexpression of a degradation-resistant FoxM1 mutant abrogated OGT RNAi-mediated effects on invasion , MMP levels , angiogenesis , and VEGF expression . Using a mouse model of metastasis , we found that reduction of OGT expression blocked bone metastasis . Altogether , these data suggest that as prostate cancer cells alter glucose and glutamine levels , O-GlcNAc modifications and OGT levels become elevated and are required for regulation of malignant properties , implicating OGT as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cancer .
It is prevailingly thought that the antiestrogens tamoxifen and ICI 182 , 780 are competitive antagonists of the estrogen-binding site of the estrogen receptor-alpha ( ER-alpha ) . However , a plethora of evidence demonstrated both antiestrogens exhibit agonist activities in different systems such as activation of the membrane-initiated signaling pathways . The mechanisms by which antiestrogens mediate estrogen-like activities have not been fully established . Previously , a variant of ER-alpha , EP-alpha36 , has been cloned and showed to mediate membrane-initiated estrogen and antiestrogen signaling in cells only expressing ER-alpha36 . Here , we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiestrogen signaling in ER-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells that express high levels of endogenous ER-alpha36 . We found that the effects of both 4-hydoxytamoxifen ( 4-OHT ) and ICI 182 , 780 ( ICI ) exhibited a non-monotonic , or biphasic dose response curve ; antiestrogens at low concentrations , elicited a mitogenic signaling pathway to stimulate cell proliferation while at high concentrations , antiestrogens inhibited cell growth . Antiestrogens at l nM induced the phosphorylation of the Src-Y416 residue , an event to activate Src , while at 5 <FFFD>M induced Src-Y527 phosphorylation that inactivates Src . Antiestrogens at 1 nM also induced phosphorylation of the MAPK/ERK and activated the Cyclin D1 promoter activity through the Src/EGFR/STAT5 pathways but not at 5 <FFFD>M . Knock-down of ER-alpha36 abrogated the biphasic antiestrogen signaling in these cells . Our results thus indicated that ER-alpha36 mediates biphasic antiestrogen signaling in the ER-negative breast cancer cells and Src functions as a switch of antiestrogen signaling dependent on concentrations of antiestrogens through the EGFR/STAT5 pathway .
The published results on nanoparticles cytotoxicity and genotoxicity such as titanium dioxide nanoparticles ( TiO(2) NPs ) are inconsistent , and often conflicting and insufficient . Since different parameters may have impact on the toxicity results , there is need to lay stress on detailed characterization of NPs and the use of different testing conditions for assessment of NPs toxicity . In order to investigate whether dispersion procedures influence NP cytotoxicity and genotoxicity , we compared two protocols giving TiO(2) NP dispersions with different stability and agglomeration states . Detailed primary and secondary characteristics of both TiO(2) NP dispersions in culture media were carried out before toxicological testing ; TK6 human lymphoblast cells , EUE human embryonic epithelial cells and Cos-1 monkey kidney fibroblasts were used to assess cytotoxicity ( by trypan blue exclusion , proliferation activity and plating efficiency assays ) and genotoxicity ( by the comet assay ) . DNA strand breaks were detected by the alkaline comet assay . DNA oxidation lesions ( especially 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine , 8-oxoG ) were measured with a modified comet assay including incubation with specific repair enzyme formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase ( FPG ) . The TiO(2) NPs dispersion with large agglomerates ( 3 min sonication and no serum in stock solution ) induced DNA damage in all three cell lines , while the TiO(2) NPs dispersed with agglomerates less than 200 nm ( foetal serum in stock solution and sonication 15 min ) had no effect on genotoxicity . An increased level of DNA oxidation lesions detected in Cos-1 and TK6 cells indicates that the leading mechanism by which TiO(2) NPs trigger genotoxicity is most likely oxidative stress . Our results show that the dispersion method used can influence the results of toxicity studies . Therefore at least two different dispersion procedures should be incorporated into assessment of cyto- and genotoxic effects of NPs . It is important , when assessing the hazard associated with NPs , to establish standard testing procedures and thorough strategies to consider the diverse conditions relevant to possible exposures .
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy frequently resulted in acquired resistance of cancer cells . The underlying mechanism of such resistance is not fully understood especially the involvement of autophagy and autophagic cell death . This study thus investigated whether an alteration in autophagy could be responsible for cisplatin resistance in the long-term exposure lung carcinoma cells . The cisplatin resistant clone ( H460/cis ) of H460 cells was established by exposing the cells with gradually increasing concentrations of cisplatin until chemoresistance acquisition was elucidated by MTT , Hoechst 33342 staining and comet assays . Degree of autophagosome formation and level of LC3 marker were evaluated by acridine orange and western blot analysis , respectively . H460/cis cells exhibited irregular shape with resistant to cisplatin-induced apoptosis compared with H460 cells . Proteins analysis for LC3 indicated that the levels of LC3 in resistant cells were significantly lower than those in H460 cells . Moreover , autophagosome formation detected by acridine orange staining was dramatically reduced in the resistant cells , suggesting the role of autophagy in attenuating of cisplatin-induced cell death . Further , co-treatment of cisplatin with autophagy inducer , trifluorperazine , could resensitize H460/cis cells to cisplatin-induced cell death . Our findings reveal the novel mechanisms causing cisplatin resistance in lung carcinoma cells after long-term drug exposure regarding autophagy .
Polyphenol-enriched fractions from natural sources have been proposed to interfere with angiogenesis in pathological conditions . We recently reported that red propolis polyphenols ( RPP ) exert antiangiogenic activity . However , molecular mechanisms of this activity remain unclear . Here , we aimed at characterizing molecular mechanisms to explain the impact of RPP on endothelial cells ' ( EC ) physiology . We used in vitro and ex and in vivo models to test the hypothesis that RPP inhibit angiogenesis by affecting hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha ( HIF1alpha ) stabilization in EC . RPP ( 10 mg/L ) affected angiogenesis by reducing migration and sprouting of EC , attenuated the formation of new blood vessels , and decreased the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into CD31-positive cells . Moreover , RPP ( 10 mg/L ) inhibited hypoxia- or dimethyloxallylglycine-induced mRNA and protein expression of the crucial angiogenesis promoter vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) in a time-dependent manner . Under hypoxic conditions , RPP at 10 mg/L , supplied for 1-4 h , decreased HIF1alpha protein accumulation , which in turn attenuated VEGF gene expression . In addition , RPP reduced the HIF1alpha protein half-life from min to 38 min under hypoxic conditions . The reduced HIF1alpha protein half-life was associated with an increase in the von Hippel-Lindau ( pVHL)-dependent proteasomal degradation of HIF1alpha . RPP ( 10 mg/L , 4 h ) downregulated Cdc42 protein expression . This caused a corresponding increase in pVHL protein levels and a subsequent degradation of HIF1alpha . In summary , we have elucidated the underlying mechanism for the antiangiogenic action of RPP , which attenuates HIF1alpha protein accumulation and signaling .
Covalent bonding interactions between the Lewis acid and Lewis base functionalities have been probed in a series of " frustrated Lewis pairs " ( FLPs ) ( mainly substituted vinylene linked intramolecular phosphane-borane adducts ) , using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques and accompanying DFT calculations . Both the ( 11)B NMR isotropic chemical shifts and nuclear electric quadrupolar coupling parameters turn out to be extremely sensitive experimental probes for such interactions , revealing linear correlations with boron-phosphorus internuclear distances . The principal component V(zz) of the ( 11)B electric field gradient tensor is tilted slightly away ( from the boron-phosphorus internuclear vector , leading to an improved understanding of the remarkable reactivity of the FLPs . Complementary ( 31)P{(1)H}-CPMAS experiments reveal significant ( 31)P-(11)B scalar spin-spin interactions ( (1)J \u2248 50 Hz ) , evidencing covalent bonding interactions between the reaction centers . Finally , ( 11)B{(31)P} rotational echo double resonance ( REDOR ) experiments show systematic deviations from calculated curves based on the internuclear distances from X-ray crystallography . These deviations suggest non-zero contributions from anisotropic indirect spin-spin ( J anisotropy ) interactions , thereby offering additional evidence for covalent bonding .
The NF-kB family of transcription factors regulates important biological functions including cell growth , survival and the immune response . We found that Human Papillomavirus type 16 ( HPV-16 ) E7 and E6/E7 proteins inhibited basal and TNF-alpha-inducible NF-kB activity in human epithelial cells cultured from the cervical transformation zone , the anatomic region where most cervical cancers develop . In contrast , HPV-16 E6 regulated NF-kB in a cell type- and cell growth-dependent manner . NF-kB influenced immortalization of cervical cells by HPV16 . Inhibition of NF-kB by an IkB alpha repressor mutant increased colony formation and immortalization by HPV-16 . In contrast , activation of NF-kB by constitutive expression of p65 inhibited proliferation and immortalization . Our results suggest that inhibition of NF-kB by HPV-16 E6/E7 contributes to immortalization of cells from the cervical transformation zone .
High-grade gliomas ( HGG ) , are the most common aggressive brain tumours in adults . Inhibitors targeting growth factor signalling pathways in glioma have shown a low clinical response rate . To accurately evaluate response to targeted therapies further in vitro studies are necessary . Growth factor pathway expression using epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , mutant EGFR ( EGFRvIII ) , platelet derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) , C-Kit and C-Abl together with phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) expression and downstream activation of AKT and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 ( P70S6K ) was analysed in 26 primary glioma cultures treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) erlotinib , gefitinib and imatinib . Response to TKIs was assessed using 50% inhibitory concentrations ( IC(50) ) . Response for each culture was compared with the EGFR/PDGFR immunocytochemical pathway profile using hierarchical cluster analysis ( HCA ) and principal component analysis ( PCA ) . Erlotinib response was not strongly associated with high expression of the growth factor pathway components . PTEN expression did not correlate with response to any of the three TKIs . Increased EGFR expression was associated with gefitinib response ; increased PDGFR-alpha expression was associated with imatinib response . The results of this in vitro study suggest gefitinib and imatinib may have therapeutic potential in HGG tumours with a corresponding growth factor receptor expression profile .
Various endocrine disrupting chemicals ( EDCs ) are exogenous compounds found in the environment and have the potential to interfere with the endocrine system and hormonal regulation . Among EDCs , bisphenolA ( BPA ) and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenol)-ethane [ methoxychlor ( MXC) ] have estrogenic activity resulting in a variety of dysfunctions in the E2-mediated response by binding to estrogen receptors ( ERs ) , causing human health problems such as abnormal reproduction and carcinogenesis . In this study , we investigated the effects of BPA and MXC on cell proliferation facilitated by ER signaling in human breast cancer cells . MCF-7 cells are known to be ERalpha-positive and to be a highly E2-responsive cancer cell line ; these cells are , therefore , a useful invitro model for detecting estrogenic activity in response to EDCs . We evaluated cancer cell proliferation following BPA and MXC treatment using an MTT assay . We analyzed alterations in the expression of genes associated with the cell cycle in MCF-7 cells by semi-quantitative reverse-transcription PCR following treatment with BPA or MXC compared to EtOH . To determine whether BPA and MXC stimulate cancer cell growth though ER signaling , we co-treated the cells with agonists ( propyl pyrazoletriol , PPT ; and diarylpropionitrile , DPN ) or an antagonist ( ICI 182,780 ) of ER signaling and reduced ERalpha gene expression via siRNA in MCF-7 cells before treatment with EDCs . These studies confirmed the carcinogenicity of EDCs invitro . As a result , BPA and MXC induced the cancer cell proliferation by the upregulation of genes that promote the cell cycle and the downregulation of anti-proliferative genes , especially ones affecting the G1/S transition via ERalpha signaling . These collective results confirm the carcinogenicity of these EDCs invitro . Further studies are required to determine whether EDCs promote carcinogenesis invivo .
We have recently proposed a new model of cancer metabolism to explain the role of aerobic glycolysis and L-lactate production in fueling tumor growth and metastasis . In this model , cancer cells secrete hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) , initiating oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis in the tumor stroma . This , in turn , drives L-lactate secretion from cancer-associated fibroblasts . Secreted L-lactate then fuels oxidative mitochondrial metabolism ( OXPHOS ) in epithelial cancer cells , by acting as a paracrine onco-metabolite . We have previously termed this type of two-compartment tumor metabolism the " Reverse Warburg Effect, " as aerobic glycolysis takes place in stromal fibroblasts , rather than epithelial cancer cells . Here , we used MCT4 immuno-staining of human breast cancer tissue microarrays ( TMAs ; > 180 triple-negative patients ) to directly assess the prognostic value of the " Reverse Warburg Effect. " MCT4 expression is a functional marker of hypoxia , oxidative stress , aerobic glycolysis , and L-lactate efflux . Remarkably , high stromal MCT4 levels ( score = 2 ) were specifically associated with decreased overall survival ( < 18% survival at 10 y post-diagnosis ) . In contrast , patients with absent stromal MCT4 expression ( score = 0 ) , had 10-y survival rates of ( p-value < 10 ( -32 ) ) . High stromal levels of MCT4 were strictly correlated with a loss of stromal Cav-1 ( p-value < 10 ( -14 ) ) , a known marker of early tumor recurrence and metastasis . In fact , the combined use of stromal Cav-1 and stromal MCT4 allowed us to more precisely identify high-risk triple-negative breast cancer patients , consistent with the goal of individualized risk-assessment and personalized cancer treatment . However , epithelial MCT4 staining had no prognostic value , indicating that the " conventional " Warburg effect does not predict clinical outcome . Thus , the " Reverse Warburg Effect " or " parasitic " energy-transfer is a key determinant of poor overall patient survival . As MCT4 is a druggable-target , MCT4 inhibitors should be developed for the treatment of aggressive breast cancers , and possibly other types of human cancers . Similarly , we discuss how stromal MCT4 could be used as a biomarker for identifying high-risk cancer patients that could likely benefit from treatment with FDA-approved drugs or existing MCT-inhibitors ( such as , AR-C155858 , AR-C117977 , and AZD-3965 ) .
Ninety-three patients with completely resected peripheral non-small cell lung cancer , clinically diagnosed 2 cm or less in diameter , were retrospectively reviewed . Their preoperative computed tomography ( CT ) and positron emission tomography ( PET ) findings , carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) values , clinico-pathological features and postoperative outcomes were analysed . Ground-glass opacity ( GGO ) ratio( soft tissue density area of the tumor/maximum area of the tumor in diameter ) was measured . The overall survival rate at 3 years was 93.3% and the relapse-free survival rate at 3 years was 89.4% with a median follow-up period of 38.5 months . Patients with GGO ratio 0.25 or less had no lymph node ( LN ) involvement nor lymph vascular invasion . Only 2 of them ( 8% ) had vascular invasion . Fisher's exact probability test revealed CEA >= 5 ng/ ml as risk factor for LN involvement( p=0.0400 ) . Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that solid adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma recurred more frequently than adenocarcinoma with GGO ( p=0.0619 , odds ratio 4.969 , 95%CI 0.9242
BACKGROUND Epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is known to be associated with chemoresistance as well as increased invasion/metastasis . However , the relationship between EMT and resistance to an epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) -targeting drug in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) remains unknown . In this study , we investigated the acquisition of EMT by gefitinib in HNSCC cell line ( UMSCC81B ) . METHODS We isolated fibroblastoid variant ( 81B-Fb ) from gefitinib-resistant UMSCC81B-GR3 cells obtained after increasing the doses of gefitinib treatment in vitro and examined EMT and its underlying mechanism . RESULT 81B-Fb cells exhibited fibroblast-like morphology , increased motility , loss of E-cadherin , acquisition of vimentin and snail expression . In 81B-Fb cells , downregulation of EGFR , which is mediated by increased ubiquitination , and activation of downstream protein kinase B ( Akt ) , glycogen synthase kinase-beta ( GSK-3beta ) signalling and upregulation of snail expression were observed compared with UMSCC81B cells . LY294002 , but not U0126 , suppressed foetal bovine serum or heregulin-beta1-induced phosphorylation of Akt/GSK-3beta and snail expression together with the inhibition of 81B-Fb cell motility . Furthermore , forced expression of EGFR resulted in partial restoration of gefitinib sensitivity and reversal of EMT . CONCLUSION These results suggest that EMT in the gefitinib-resistant cells is mediated by the downregulation of EGFR and compensatory activation of Akt/GSK-3beta/snail pathway .
Treacher-Collins-Franceschetti syndrome ( TCS ) is an autosomal dominant craniofacial disorder characterised by midface hypoplasia , micrognathia , downslanting palpebral fissures , eyelid colobomata , and ear deformities that often lead to conductive deafness . A total of 182 patients with signs consistent with a diagnosis of TCS were screened by DNA sequence and dosage analysis of the TCOF1 gene . In all , 92 cases were found to have a pathogenic mutation by sequencing and 5 to have a partial gene deletion . A further case had a novel in-frame deletion in the alternatively spliced exon 6A of uncertain pathogenicity . The majority of the pathogenic sequence changes were found to predict premature protein termination , however , four novel missense changes in the LIS1 homology motif at the 5 ' end of the gene were identified . The partial gene deletions of different sizes represent of all the pathogenic TCOF1 mutations identified , indicating that gene rearrangements account for a significant proportion of TCS cases . This is the first report of gene rearrangements resulting in TCS . These findings expand the TCOF1 mutation spectrum indicating that dosage analysis should be performed together with sequence analysis , a strategy that is predicted to have a sensitivity of 71% for patients in whom TCS is strongly suspected .
The Warburg effect describes a heightened propensity of tumor cells to produce lactic acid in the presence or absence of O(2) . A generally held notion is that the Warburg effect is related to energy . Using whole-genome , proteomic MALDI-TOF-MS and metabolite analysis , we investigated the Warburg effect in malignant neuroblastoma N2a cells . The findings show that the Warburg effect serves a functional role in regulating acidic pericellular pH ( pHe ) , which is mediated by metabolic inversion or a fluctuating dominance between glycolytic-rate substrate level phosphorylation ( SLP ) and mitochondrial ( mt ) oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) to control lactic acid production . The results also show that an alkaline pHe caused an elevation in SLP/OXPHOS ratio ( approximately 98% SLP/OXPHOS ) ; while the ratio was approximately 56% at neutral pHe and approximately 93% in acidic pHe . Acidic pHe paralleled greater expression of mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS genes , such as complex III-V ( Uqcr10 , Atp5 and Cox7c ) , mt Fmc1 , Romo1 , Tmem 173 , Tomm6 , aldehyde dehydrogenase , mt Sod2 mt biogenesis component PPAR-\u03b3 co-activator 1 adjunct to loss of mt fission ( Mff ) . Moreover , acidic pHe corresponded to metabolic efficiency evidenced by a rise in mTOR nutrient sensor G\u03b2L , its downstream target ( Eif4ebp1 ) , insulin modulators ( Trib3 and Fetub ) and loss of catabolic ( Hadhb , Bdh1 and Pygl)/glycolytic processes ( aldolase C , pyruvate kinase , Nampt and aldose-reductase ) . In contrast , alkaline pHe initiated loss of mitofusin 2 , complex II-IV ( Sdhaf1 , Uqcrq , Cox4i2 and Aldh1l2 ) , aconitase , mitochondrial carrier triple repeat 1 and mt biosynthetic ( Coq2 , Coq5 and Coq9 ) . In conclusion , the Warburg effect might serve as a negative feedback loop that regulates the pHe toward a broad acidic range by altering lactic acid production through inversion of metabolic systems . These effects were independent of changes in O(2) concentration or glucose supply .
OBJECTIVES To investigate the immunoexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in a sample of oral leukoplakias ( OL ) and to determine the receptor ' s association with dysplasia , tobacco consumption , lesion site , and proliferation rate . Although EGFR should be overexpressed in some oral leukoplakias , the factors that may interfere with this expression and the influence of this receptor on epithelial proliferation have yet to be investigated . STUDY DESIGN Samples of oral leukoplakias ( 48 ) and of normal oral epithelium ( 10 ) were immunohistologically examined for expression of EGFR . Immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 , and p27 were also performed in leukoplakias . EGFR expression was associated with clinical and pathological features . RESULTS EGFR was positive in 62.5% of the leukoplakias and 50% of normal oral epithelium . The number of EGFR positive OL located in high-risk sites was significantly higher than EGFR positive OL located in low-risk sites . Most of the p27 negative leukoplakias were EGFR positive , and the p27 index in the parabasal layer was diminished in the presence of dysplasia . Positivity for EGFR was not associated with dysplasia , tobacco exposure , or Ki-67 . CONCLUSION EGFR is expressed in leukoplakia regardless of dysplasia , but EGFR positivity should be more frequent in lesions sited in areas of high cancer risk . The association between EGFR and p27 may represent an important mechanism in the control of cellular proliferation and malignant progression of oral epithelium and therefore warrants further investigation .
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in Europe and the United States , and the third leading cause of death from cancer in Europe . Survival of prostate cancer cells is dependent on the activation of androgen receptors ( AR ) , that are overexpressed in this tumor . Furthermore , of prostate cancer patients that respond to first-line androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) undergo rapid progression . This condition is defined as castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . Docetaxel-based regimens significantly improve overall survival ( OS ) in patients with CRPC and represent the only treatment strategy approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Recently , abiraterone ( second hormonal therapy ) and cabazitaxel ( new taxane ) have been shown to improve survival in patients with CRPC who progressed following docetaxel-based chemotherapy . Vaccine therapy has also been demonstrated to improve OS in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic CRPC . Additional therapeutic targets have been analyzed in prostate cancer , including apoptosis , angiogenic receptors , vitamin D and Src pathways . Several phase II studies are ongoing . The high frequency of prostate cancer-related metastatic bone disease has led to consider this pathway as a therapeutic target . To this end , several bone-targeted agents have been investigated , most notably zoledronic acid , which is highly effective at stabilizing the bone and preventing skeletal complications . More recently , a nuclear factor-beta ligand ( RANKL ) inhibitor , denosumab , has been developed for the treatment of bone metastases .
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with the high risk of colon cancer and a variety of other diseases . The active vitamin D metabolite 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) ( 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) ) regulates gene transcription via its nuclear receptor ( VDR ) , and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of gene expression have also been proposed . We have identified microRNA-22 ( miR-22 ) and several other miRNA species as 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) targets in human colon cancer cells . Remarkably , miR-22 is induced by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in a time- , dose- and VDR-dependent manner . In SW480-ADH and HCT116 cells , miR-22 loss-of-function by transfection of a miR-22 inhibitor suppresses the antiproliferative effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) . Additionally , miR-22 inhibition increases cell migration per se and decreases the antimigratory effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in both cell types . In silico analysis shows a significant overlap between genes suppressed by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and miR-22 putative target genes . Consistently , miR-22 inhibition abrogates the 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated suppression of NELL2 , OGN , HNRPH1 , RERE and NFAT5 genes . In 39 out of 50 ( 78% ) human colon cancer patients , miR-22 expression was found lower in the tumour than in the matched normal tissue and correlated directly with that of VDR . Our results indicate that miR-22 is induced by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in human colon cancer cells and it may contribute to its antitumour action against this neoplasia .
Chromosomal inversions are usually portrayed as simple two-breakpoint rearrangements changing gene order but not gene number or structure . However , increasing evidence suggests that inversion breakpoints may often have a complex structure and entail gene duplications with potential functional consequences . Here , we used a combination of different techniques to investigate the breakpoint structure and the functional consequences of a complex rearrangement fixed in Drosophila buzzatii and comprising two tandemly arranged inversions sharing the middle breakpoint : 2m and 2n . By comparing the sequence in the breakpoint regions between D. buzzatii ( inverted chromosome ) and D. mojavensis ( noninverted chromosome ) , we corroborate the breakpoint reuse at the molecular level and infer that inversion 2m was associated with a duplication of a kb segment and likely generated by staggered breaks plus repair by nonhomologous end joining . The duplicated segment contained the gene CG4673 , involved in nuclear transport , and its two nested genes CG5071 and CG5079 . Interestingly , we found that other than the inversion and the associated duplication , both breakpoints suffered additional rearrangements , that is , the proximal breakpoint experienced a microinversion event associated at both ends with a 121-bp long duplication that contains a promoter . As a consequence of all these different rearrangements , CG5079 has been lost from the genome , CG5071 is now a single copy nonnested gene , and CG4673 has a transcript kb shorter and seems to have acquired a more complex gene regulation . Our results illustrate the complex effects of chromosomal rearrangements and highlight the need of complementing genomic approaches with detailed sequence-level and functional analyses of breakpoint regions if we are to fully understand genome structure , function , and evolutionary dynamics .
Active avoidance by tumor cells from attack and elimination by immune cells is an emerging cancer hallmark that is achieved primarily through decreasing the levels of major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC-I ) at the cancer cells ' surface . Deficiencies in MHC-I antigen-restricted immunosurveillance may be intertwined with an altered , Warburg-like cancer cell-intrinsic metabolism , another emerging hallmark of cancer that involves a switch from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis to efficiently support large-scale biosynthetic programs that are required for active cell proliferation . We recently envisioned that intervention strategies aimed at reversing the bioenergetic signature of cancer cells ( e.g. , the antidiabetic biguanide metformin ) should correct oncogene ( e.g. , HER2)-driven MHC-I defects , thus preventing immune escape of oncogene transformants . First , we explored how metformin treatment impacted mitochondrial biogenesis in cultured breast cancer cells overexpressing the membrane tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 , the best-characterized downregulator of MHC-I . Metformin exposure was found to dose-dependently increase the expression levels of cytochrome c oxidase I and mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase , which are encoded by mitochondrial and nuclear DNA , respectively . Second , we explored whether metformin-enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis might significantly alter the MHC-I status in breast carcinoma cells . MHC-I expression , as assessed by flow cytometry using an anti-HLA-ABC monoclonal antibody , was fully restored ( up to upregulation ) in MHC-I-negative HER2 gene-amplified carcinoma cells . These findings may help delineate a previously unrecognized mechanism through which metformin ( and metformin-like drugs ) may enable a cancer patient's own immune system to mount an efficient anti-metastasis response that can prevent or delay disease recurrence . Restored antigenicity and immunogenicity of tumor cells may represent a previously unrecognized primary mode of action underlying the cancer-preventive effects of metformin .
The subtelomeric regions of organisms ranging from protists to fungi undergo a much higher rate of rearrangement than is observed in the rest of the genome . While characterizing these regions of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans , we have identified a recent gene amplification event near the right telomere of chromosome 3 that involves a gene encoding an arsenite efflux transporter ( ARR3 ) . The 3,177-bp amplicon exists in a tandem array of 2-15 copies and is present exclusively in strains with the C. neoformans var. grubii subclade VNI A5 MLST profile . Strains bearing the amplification display dramatically enhanced resistance to arsenite that correlates with the copy number of the repeat ; the origin of increased resistance was verified as transport-related by functional complementation of an arsenite transporter mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Subsequent experimental evolution in the presence of increasing concentrations of arsenite yielded highly resistant strains with the ARR3 amplicon further amplified to over 50 copies , accounting for up to of the whole genome and making the copy number of this repeat as high as that seen for the ribosomal DNA . The example described here therefore represents a rare evolutionary intermediate-an array that is currently in a state of dynamic flux , in dramatic contrast to relatively common , static relics of past tandem duplications that are unable to further amplify due to nucleotide divergence . Beyond identifying and engineering fungal isolates that are highly resistant to arsenite and describing the first reported instance of microevolution via massive gene amplification in C. neoformans , these results suggest that adaptation through gene amplification may be an important mechanism that C. neoformans employs in response to environmental stresses , perhaps including those encountered during infection . More importantly , the ARR3 array will serve as an ideal model for further molecular genetic analyses of how tandem gene duplications arise and expand .
Plitidepsin ( Aplidin ) , an antitumor agent of marine origin , presently is undergoing phase II/III clinical trials , and has shown promise for the treatment of lymphoma . Here , we describe the antitumor effects of plitidepsin alone and in combination with rituximab and investigated the effects of each drug and the combination on the cell cycle and mechanism of cell death . Several Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma ( DLCL ) lines and Burkitt cell lines were tested for sensitivity to plitidepsin and rituximab . All DLCL and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines were inhibited by plitidepsin in nanomolar concentrations , while rituximab sensitivity varied among different cell lines . Ramos and the RL cell lines proved sensitive to rituximab and were used to test the effects of each of the two drugs . The two agents exhibited synergism at all tested concentrations . For in vivo studies , irradiated athymic nude mice were engrafted with the Ramos lymphoma . Treatment was initiated when the tumors were cm in diameter , and toxic and therapeutic effects were monitored . In the in vivo study , additive effects of the combined two drugs , was demonstrated without an increase in host toxicity . The in vitro synergy and the in vivo additive antitumor effects without an increase in host toxicity with two relatively non-marrow suppressive agents encourages further development of this combination for treatment of aggressive B-cell lymphomas .
Whereas estrogen-estrogen receptor alpha ( ER ) signaling plays an important role in breast cancer growth , it is also necessary for the differentiation of normal breast epithelial cells . How this functional conversion occurs , however , remains unknown . Based on a genome-wide sequencing study that identified mutations in several breast cancer genes , we examined some of the genes for mutations , expression levels , and functional effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenesis . We present the data for C1orf64 or ER-related factor ( ERRF ) from 31 cell lines and 367 primary breast cancer tumors . Whereas mutation of ERRF was infrequent ( 1 of 79 or 1.3% ) , its expression was up-regulated in breast cancer , and the up-regulation was more common in lower-stage tumors . In addition , increased ERRF expression was significantly associated with ER and/or progesterone receptor ( PR ) positivity , which was still valid in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2)-negative tumors . In ER-positive tumors , ERRF expression was inversely correlated with HER2 status . Furthermore , higher ERRF protein expression was significantly associated with better disease-free survival and overall survival , particularly in ER- and/or PR-positive and HER2-negative tumors ( luminal A subtype ) . Functionally , knockdown of ERRF in two ER-positive breast cancer cell lines , T-47D and MDA-MB-361 , suppressed cell growth in vitro and tumorigenesis in xenograft models . These results suggest that ERRF plays a role in estrogen-ER-mediated growth of breast cancer cells and could , thus , be a potential therapeutic target .
Estrogens play essential roles in the progression of mammary and prostatic diseases . The transcriptional effects of estrogens are transduced by two estrogen receptors , ERalpha and ERbeta , which elicit opposing roles in regulating proliferation : ERalpha is proliferative while ERbeta is anti-proliferative . Exogenous expression of ERbeta in ERalpha-positive cancer cell lines inhibits cell proliferation in response to estrogen and reduces xenografted tumor growth in vivo , suggesting that ERbeta might oppose ERalpha's proliferative effects via formation of ERalpha/beta heterodimers . Despite biochemical and cellular evidence of ERalpha/beta heterodimer formation in cells co-expressing both receptors , the biological roles of the ERalpha/beta heterodimer remain to be elucidated . Here we report the identification of two phytoestrogens that selectively activate ERalpha/beta heterodimers at specific concentrations using a cell-based , two-step high throughput small molecule screen for ER transcriptional activity and ER dimer selectivity . Using ERalpha/beta heterodimer-selective ligands at defined concentrations , we demonstrate that ERalpha/beta heterodimers are growth inhibitory in breast and prostate cells which co-express the two ER isoforms . Furthermore , using Automated Quantitative Analysis ( AQUA ) to examine nuclear expression of ERalpha and ERbeta in human breast tissue microarrays , we demonstrate that ERalpha and ERbeta are co-expressed in the same cells in breast tumors . The co-expression of ERalpha and ERbeta in the same cells supports the possibility of ERalpha/beta heterodimer formation at physio- and pathological conditions , further suggesting that targeting ERalpha/beta heterodimers might be a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of cancers which co-express ERalpha and ERbeta .
Induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) generated by epigenetic reprogramming of personal somatic cells have limited therapeutic capacity for patients suffering from genetic disorders . Here we demonstrate restoration of a genomic mutation heterozygous for Pkd1 ( polycystic kidney disease 1 ) deletion ( Pkd1(+/-) to Pkd1(+/R+) ) by spontaneous mitotic recombination . Notably , recombination between homologous chromosomes occurred at a frequency of 1 per 10,000 iPSCs . Southern blot hybridization and genomic PCR analyses demonstrated that the genotype of the mutation-restored iPSCs was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type cells . Importantly , the frequency of cyst generation in kidneys of adult chimeric mice containing Pkd1(+/R+) iPSCs was significantly lower than that of adult chimeric mice with parental Pkd1(+/-) iPSCs , and indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice . This repair step could be directly incorporated into iPSC development programmes prior to cell transplantation , offering an invaluable step forward for patients carrying a wide range of genetic disorders .
Approximately 50% of human tumors have a mutation in TP53 . The pattern and spectra of TP53 mutations often differ between cancer types , perhaps due to different etiological factors . The Hupki ( human TP53 knock-in ) mouse embryo fibroblast ( HUF ) immortalization assay is useful for studying mutagenesis in the human TP53 gene by environmental carcinogens . Prior to initiating an immortalization assay , carcinogen treatment conditions must be optimized , which can require a large number of cells . As primary HUF cultures senesce within 2 weeks , restricting their use , we investigated whether immortalized HUFs retaining wild-type TP53 can be surrogates for primary HUFs in initial treatment optimization . DNA damage by eight compounds found in diesel exhaust , benzo[a]pyrene , 3-nitrobenzanthrone , 1-nitropyrene , 1,3-dinitropyrene , 1,6-dinitropyrene , 1,8-dinitropyrene , 6-nitrochrysene , and 3-nitrofluorene , was assessed by ( 32 ) P-postlabeling and the alkaline comet assay in primary HUFs and in an immortal HUF cell line J201 . For most compounds , higher levels of DNA adducts accumulated in J201 cells than in primary HUFs . This difference was not reflected in the comet assay or by cell viability changes . Experiments in three additional immortal HUF cell lines ( AAI49 , U56 , and E2-143 ) confirmed strong differences in DNA adduct levels compared with primary HUFs . However , these did not correlate with the protein expression of Nqo1 or Nat1/2 , or with gene expression of Cyp1a1 or Cyp1b1 . Our results show that using immortal HUFs as surrogates for primary HUFs in genotoxicity screening has limitations and that DNA adduct formation is the best measure of genotoxicity of the nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons tested in HUFs .
Electronic properties of DNA are believed to play a crucial role in many phenomena in living organisms , for example the location of DNA lesions by base excision repair ( BER ) glycosylases and the regulation of tumor-suppressor genes such as p53 by detection of oxidative damage . However , the reproducible measurement and modelling of charge migration through DNA molecules at the nanometer scale remains a challenging and controversial subject even after more than a decade of intense efforts . Here we show , by analysing 162 disease-related genes from a variety of medical databases with a total of almost 20,000 observed pathogenic mutations , a significant difference in the electronic properties of the population of observed mutations compared to the set of all possible mutations . Our results have implications for the role of the electronic properties of DNA in cellular processes , and hint at the possibility of prediction , early diagnosis and detection of mutation hotspots .
The covalent modification of proteins with ubiquitin is required for accurate cell division in all eukaryotes . Ubiquitylation depends on an enzymatic cascade , in which E3 enzymes recruit specific substrates for modification . Among human E3s , the SCF ( Skp1-cullin1-F-box ) and the APC/C ( anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome ) are known for driving the degradation of cell cycle regulators to accomplish irreversible cell cycle transitions . The cell cycle machinery reciprocally regulates the SCF and APC/C through various mechanisms , including the modification of these E3s or the binding of specific inhibitors . Recent studies have provided new insight into the intricate relationship between ubiquitylation and the cell division apparatus as they revealed roles for atypical ubiquitin chains , new mechanisms of substrate and E3 regulation , as well as extensive crosstalk between ubiquitylation enzymes . Here , we review these emerging regulatory mechanisms of ubiquitin-dependent cell cycle control and discuss how their manipulation might provide therapeutic benefits in the future .
Ubiquitylation is a reversible post-translational modification that has emerged as a key regulator of most complex cellular processes . It may rival phosphorylation in scope and exceed it in complexity . The dynamic nature of ubiquitylation events is important for governing protein stability , maintaining ubiquitin homeostasis and controlling ubiquitin-dependent signalling pathways . The human genome encodes active deubiquitylating enzymes ( DUBs , also referred to as deubiquitinases ) , which exhibit distinct specificity profiles towards the various ubiquitin chain topologies . As a result of their ability to reverse ubiquitylation , these enzymes control a broad range of key cellular processes . In this Commentary we discuss the cellular functions of DUBs , such as their role in governing membrane traffic and protein quality control . We highlight two key signalling pathways--the Wnt and transforming growth factor \u03b2 ( TGF-\u03b2 ) pathways , for which dynamic ubiquitylation has emerged as a key regulator . We also discuss the roles of DUBs in the nucleus , where they govern transcriptional activity and DNA repair pathways .
Xanthone exhibits several medicinal activities and especially it inhibits the growth of cancer cells . However , the use of xanthone is limited because of its low aqueous solubility and systemic toxicity . In the present study xanthone was loaded into poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly[N-(2-hydroxypropyl ) methacrylamide-dilactate ] mPEG-b-p(HPMAm-Lac(2)) micelles in order to overcome these drawbacks . It was shown that xanthone could be loaded in these micelles up to 2 mg/mL with entrapment efficiency and loading capacity . The average particle diameter of the xanthone loaded mPEG-b-p(HPMAm-Lac(2)) micelles as determined by dynamic light scattering ranged from 84 to 112 nm . In vitro assays showed that xanthone in its free form as well as loaded in polymeric micelles had a high cytotoxicity towards both doxorubicin sensitive and , importantly , resistant cancer cells . On the other hand empty mPEG-b-p(HPMAm-Lac(2)) micelles did not show any cytotoxicity towards normal cells ( PBMCs ) . Interestingly , the cytostatic effect of xanthone towards normal cells was masked when loaded in the micelles . The mechanism of cell growth inhibition by xanthone-loaded polymeric micelles was mediated through induction of apoptosis , as evidenced from a subdiploid peak of propidium iodide stained cells using flow cytometric analysis . From the results of this study it can be concluded that xanthone has potent anticancer activity not only on sensitive but also on doxorubicin resistant cancer cell lines. mPEG-b-p(HPMAm-Lac(2)) micelles are therefore attractive delivery systems of xanthone for the treatment of cancer .
We have discovered that 3,3',5-triiodothyronine ( T3 ) inhibits binding of a PIP-box sequence peptide to proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) protein by competing for the same binding site , as evidenced by the co-crystal structure of the PCNA-T3 complex at 2.1 A resolution . Based on this observation , we have designed a novel , non-peptide small molecule PCNA inhibitor , T2 amino alcohol ( T2AA ) , a T3 derivative that lacks thyroid hormone activity . T2AA inhibited interaction of PCNA/PIP-box peptide with an IC(50) of mum and also PCNA and full-length p21 protein , the tightest PCNA ligand protein known to date . T2AA abolished interaction of PCNA and DNA polymerase delta in cellular chromatin . De novo DNA synthesis was inhibited by T2AA , and the cells were arrested in S-phase . T2AA inhibited growth of cancer cells with induction of early apoptosis . Concurrently , Chk1 and RPA32 in the chromatin are phosphorylated , suggesting that T2AA causes DNA replication stress by stalling DNA replication forks . T2AA significantly inhibited translesion DNA synthesis on a cisplatin-cross-linked template in cells . When cells were treated with a combination of cisplatin and T2AA , a significant increase in phospho(Ser(139))histone H2AX induction and cell growth inhibition was observed .
Arsenic trioxide ( As(2)O(3) ) has shown remarkable efficacy for the treatment of multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Histone deacetylases ( HDAC ) play an important role in the control of gene expression , and their dysregulation has been linked to myeloma . Especially , HDAC6 , a unique cytoplasmic member of class II , which mainly functions as alpha-tubulin deacetylase and Hsp90 deacetylase , has become a target for drug development to treat cancer due to its major contribution in oncogenic cell transformation . However , the mechanisms of action for As(2)O(3) have not yet been defined . In this study , we investigated the effect of As(2)O(3) on proliferation and apoptosis in human myeloma cell line and primary myeloma cells , and then we studied that As(2)O(3) exerts antimyeloma effects by inhibiting activity in the alpha-tubulin and Hsp90 through western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation . We found that As(2)O(3) acts directly on MM cells at relatively low concentrations of 0.5 <FFFD>M , which effects survival and apoptosis of MM cells . However , As(2)O(3) inhibited HDAC activity at the relatively high concentration and dose-dependent manner ( great than 4 <FFFD>M ) . Subsequently , we found that As(2)O(3) treatment in a dose- and time-dependent fashion markedly increased the level of acetylated alpha-tubulin and acetylated Hsp90 , and inhibited the chaperone association with IKKalpha activities and increased degradation of IKKalpha . Importantly , the loss of IKKalpha-associated Hsp90 occurred prior to any detectable loss in the levels of IKKalpha , indicating a novel pathway by which As(2)O(3) down-regulates HDAC6 to destabilize IKKalpha protein via Hsp90 chaperone function . Furthermore , we observed the effect of As(2)O(3) on TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB signaling pathway was to significantly reduced phosphorylation of Ser-536 on NF-kappaB p65 . Therefore , our studies provide an important insight into the molecular mechanism of anti-myeloma activity of As(2)O(3) in HDAC6-Hsp90-IKKalpha-NFkappaB signaling axis and the rationale for As(2)O(3) can be extended readily using all the HDAC associated diseases .
Although interferon ( IFN ) has been often used as immunotherapy for bladder cancer , its efficacy is rather unsatisfactory , demanding further improvement . Combination therapy is one of viable options , and grape seed proanthocyanidin ( GSP ) could be such an agent to be used with IFN because it has been shown to have anticancer activity . We thus investigated whether combination of IFN and GSP might enhance the overall antiproliferative effect on bladder cancer cells in vitro . Human bladder cancer T24 cells were employed and treated with the varying concentrations of recombinant IFN-alpha(2b) ( 0-100,000 IU/ml ) , GSP ( 0-100 mug/ml ) , or their combinations . IFN-alpha(2b) alone led to a growth reduction at 20,000 ( 20K ) IU/ml , which further declined to at >=50K IU/ml . Similarly , GSP alone induced a and growth reduction at 25 and >=50 mug/ml , respectively . When IFN-alpha(2b) and GSP were then combined , combination of 50K IU/ml IFN-alpha(2b) and 25 mug/ml GSP resulted in a drastic >95% growth reduction . Cell cycle analysis indicated that such an enhanced growth inhibition was accompanied by a G(1) cell cycle arrest . This was further confirmed by Western blot analysis revealing that expressions of G(1)-specific cell cycle regulators ( CDK2 , CDK4 , cyclin E and p27/Kip1 ) were distinctly modulated with such IFN-alpha(2b)/GSP treatment . Therefore , these findings support the notion that combination of IFN-alpha(2b) and GSP is capable of additively enhancing antiproliferative effect on T24 cells with a G(1) cell cycle arrest , implying an adjuvant therapeutic modality for superficial bladder cancer .
We have recently proposed a new two-compartment model for understanding the Warburg effect in tumor metabolism . In this model , glycolytic stromal cells produce mitochondrial fuels ( L-lactate and ketone bodies ) that are then transferred to oxidative epithelial cancer cells , driving OXPHOS and mitochondrial metabolism . Thus , stromal catabolism fuels anabolic tumor growth via energy transfer . We have termed this new cancer paradigm the " reverse Warburg effect, " because stromal cells undergo aerobic glycolysis , rather than tumor cells . To assess whether this mechanism also applies during cancer cell metastasis , we analyzed the bioenergetic status of breast cancer lymph node metastases , by employing a series of metabolic protein markers . For this purpose , we used MCT4 to identify glycolytic cells . Similarly , we used TO MM20 and COX staining as markers of mitochondrial mass and OXPHOS activity , respectively . Consistent with the " reverse Warburg effect, " our results indicate that metastatic breast cancer cells amplify oxidative mitochondrial metabolism ( OXPHOS ) and that adjacent stromal cells are glycolytic and lack detectable mitochondria . Glycolytic stromal cells included cancer-associated fibroblasts , adipocytes and inflammatory cells . Double labeling experiments with glycolytic ( MCT4 ) and oxidative ( TO MM20 or COX ) markers directly shows that at least two different metabolic compartments co-exist , side-by-side , within primary tumors and their metastases . Since cancer-associated immune cells appeared glycolytic , this observation may also explain how inflammation literally " fuels " tumor progression and metastatic dissemination , by " feeding " mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells . Finally , MCT4(+) and TO MM20(-) " glycolytic " cancer cells were rarely observed , indicating that the conventional " Warburg effect " does not frequently occur in cancer-positive lymph node metastases .
Proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) , a potential anticancer target , forms a homotrimer and is required for DNA replication and numerous other cellular processes . The purpose of this study was to identify novel small molecules that modulate PCNA activity to affect tumor cell proliferation . An in silico screen of a compound library against a crystal structure of PCNA and a subsequent structural similarity search of the ZINC chemical database were carried out to derive relevant docking partners . Nine compounds , termed PCNA inhibitors ( PCNA-Is ) , were selected for further characterization . PCNA-I1 selectively bound to PCNA trimers with a dissociation constant ( K(d) ) of to 0.4 muM . PCNA-Is promoted the formation of SDS-refractory PCNA trimers . PCNA-I1 dose- and time-dependently reduced the chromatin-associated PCNA in cells . Consistent with its effects on PCNA trimer stabilization , PCNA-I1 inhibited the growth of tumor cells of various tissue types with an IC(50) of muM , whereas it affected the growth of nontransformed cells at significantly higher concentrations ( IC(50) , muM ) . Moreover , uptake of BrdU was dose-dependently reduced in cells treated with PCNA-I1 . Mechanistically the PCNA-Is mimicked the effect of PCNA knockdown by siRNA , inducing cancer cell arrest at both the S and G(2)/M phases . Thus , we have identified a class of compounds that can directly bind to PCNA , stabilize PCNA trimers , reduce PCNA association with chromatin , and inhibit tumor cell growth by inducing a cell cycle arrest . They are valuable tools in studying PCNA function and may be useful for future PCNA-targeted cancer therapy .
The breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , an ATP binding cassette ( ABC ) efflux transporter , plays a role in multiple drug resistance ( MDR ) . Previous studies of the subcellular location of the ABC transporter P-glycoprotein indicated that this protein is expressed in nuclear membranes . This study examines the nuclear distribution of BCRP in seven human-derived glioblastoma ( GBM ) and astrocytoma cell lines . BCRP expression was observed in the nuclear extracts of 6/7 cell lines . Using the GBM LN229 cell line as a model , nuclear BCRP protein was detected by immunoblotting and confocal laser microscopy . Importantly , nuclear BCRP staining was found in a subpopulation of tumour cells in a human brain GBM biopsy . Mitoxantrone cytotoxicity in the LN229 cell line was determined with and without the BCRP inhibitor fumitremorgin C ( FTC ) and after downregulation of BCRP with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) . FTC inhibition of BCRP increased mitoxantrone cytotoxicity with a reduction in the IC50 and this effect was further potentiated in the siRNA-treated cells . In conclusion , BCRP is expressed in the nuclear extracts of select GBM and astrocytoma cell lines and in a human GBM tumour biopsy . Its presence in the nucleus of cancer cells suggests new role for BCRP in MDR .
Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in children . Several large-scale genomic studies have detailed their heterogeneity , defining multiple subtypes with unique molecular profiles and clinical behavior . Increased expression of the miR-183 cluster of microRNAs has been noted in several subgroups , including the most clinically aggressive subgroup associated with genetic amplification of MYC . To understand the contribution of miR-183 to the pathogenesis of this aggressive subtype of medulloblastoma , we analyzed global gene expression and proteomic changes that occur upon modulation of miRNAs in this cluster individually and as a group in MYC-amplified medulloblastoma cells . Knockdown of the full miR-183 cluster results in enrichment of genes associated with apoptosis and dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis . Conversely , there is a relative enrichment of pathways associated with migration , metastasis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition , as well as pathways associated with dysfunction of DNA repair in cells with preserved miR-183 cluster expression . Immunocytochemistry and FACS analysis confirm induction of apoptosis upon knockdown of the miR-183 cluster . Importantly , cell-based migration and invasion assays verify the positive regulation of cell motility/migration by the miR-183 cluster , which is largely mediated by miR-182 . We show that the effects on cell migration induced by the miR-183 cluster are coupled to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway through differential regulation of AKT1 and AKT2 isoforms . Furthermore , we show that rapamycin inhibits cell motility/migration in medulloblastoma cells and phenocopies miR-183 cluster knockdown . Thus , the miR-183 cluster regulates multiple biological programs that converge to support the maintenance and metastatic potential of medulloblastoma .
As part of our program to develop breast cancer specific therapeutic agents , we have synthesized a conjugate agent that is a conjugate of the steroidal anti-estrogen and the potent cytotoxin doxorubicin . In this effort , we employed a modular assembly approach to prepare a novel 11beta-substituted steroidal anti-estrogen functionalized with an azido-tetraethylene glycol moiety , which could be coupled to a complementary doxorubicin benzoyl hydrazone functionalized with a propargyl tetraethylene glycol moiety . Huisgen [ 3 + 2 ] cycloaddition chemistry gave the final hybrid that was evaluated for selective uptake and cytotoxicity in ER(+)-MCF-7 and ER(-)-MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines . The results demonstrated that the presence of the anti-estrogenic component in the hybrid compound was critical for selectivity and cytotoxicity in ER(+)-MCF-7 human breast cancer cells as the hybrid was more potent than doxorubicin in inhibition of cell proliferation and promoting cell death .
It has been shown that regulation of EGFR expression in prostate cancer cells is mostly at the transcriptional level. microRNA-133 ( miR-133 ) has long been recognized as a muscle-specific miRNA which may regulate myoblast differentiation and participate in many myogenic diseases . Recently , it has been reported that miR-133 is also involved in other tumors , such as bladder cancer , esophageal cancer and may regulate cell motility in these cancer cells . In the present study , we examined the expression and effects of miR-133 in two hormone-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines . The expression of miR-133a and miR-133b were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR . After transfection of miR-133a and miR-133b , cell viability assay , luciferase assay , western blot analysis , cell migration and invasion assay were conducted in Du145 and PC3 cells . In this study , we showed that miR-133a and miR-133b are expressed at the detection limit in two hormone-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines , PC3 and DU145 . Ectopic expression of miR-133 inhibited cell proliferation , migration and invasion in these cells . We also provide the first evidence that miR-133 may target EGFR . Our study provided the first glimpse of the functional role of miR-133 in two hormone-independent prostate cancer cell lines . These results may add to our knowledge on the molecular basis of prostate cancer progression .
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are small non-coding RNAs of nucleotides that function as negative regulators of gene expression by either inhibiting translation or inducing deadenylation-dependent degradation of target transcripts . Notably , deregulation of miRNAs expression is associated with the initiation and progression of human cancers where they act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors contributing to tumorigenesis . Abnormal miRNA expression may provide potential diagnostic and prognostic tumor biomarkers and new therapeutic targets in cancer . Recently , several miRNAs have been shown to initiate invasion and metastasis by targeting multiple proteins that are major players in these cellular events , thus they have been denominated as metastamiRs . Here , we present a review of the current knowledge of miRNAs in cancer with a special focus on metastamiRs . In addition we discuss their potential use as novel specific markers for cancer progression .
Immortalization ( senescence bypass ) is a critical rate-limiting step in the malignant transformation of mammalian somatic cells . Human cells must breach at least two distinct senescence barriers to permit unfettered clonal evolution during cancer development : ( 1 ) stress- or oncogene-induced premature senescence ( SIPS/OIS ) , mediated via the p16-Rb and/or ARF-p53-p21 tumour-suppressive pathways , and ( 2 ) replicative senescence triggered by telomere shortening . In contrast , because their telomerase is constitutively active , cells from small rodents possess only the SIPS/OIS barrier , and are therefore useful for studying SIPS/OIS bypass in isolation . Dermal fibroblasts from the Syrian hamster ( SHD cells ) are exceptionally resistant to spontaneous SIPS bypass , but it can be readily induced following exposure to a wide range of chemical and physical carcinogens . Here we show that a spectrum of carcinogen-specific mutational and epigenetic alterations involving the INK4A ( p16 ) , p53 and INK4B ( p15 ) genes are associated with induced SIPS bypass . With ionizing radiation , immortalization is invariably accompanied by efficient biallelic deletion of the complete INK4/CDKN2 locus . In comparison , SHD cells immortalized by the powerful polycyclic hydrocarbon carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene display transversion point mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53 coupled with INK4 alterations such as loss of expression of p15 . Epimutational silencing of p16 is the primary event associated with immortalization by nickel , a human non-genotoxic carcinogen . As SIPS/OIS bypass is a prerequisite for the immortalization of normal diploid human epithelial cells , our results with the SHD model will provide a basis for delineating combinations of key molecular changes underpinning this important event in human carcinogenesis .
BACKGROUND Cancer of the thyroid gland is rare in children and adolescents . A history of neck irradiation is a well-established risk factor for tumor development , and most previous reports focused on cases that were induced by radiation exposure . We present here a retrospective review of the clinical features , treatment , and long-term outcome of children and adolescents with papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) without a history of radiation exposure who were treated at our institution over a period of METHODS We retrospectively investigated 142 PTC patients without an irradiation history who were younger than 20years of age when treated from 1961 to 2005 ( 17 males and 125 females ; mean age=16.3+/-2.7years ; follow-up=21.8+/-12.0years ) . The clinicopathological results were evaluated using the medical records . Disease-free survival ( DFS ) and cause-specific survival ( CSS ) were assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test . Parametric analyses were performed using Student's t test and nonparametric analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test . RESULTS At diagnosis , three patients had distant lung metastasis and 33 had gross neck lymph node ( LN ) metastasis . All patients were treated with surgery ( hemi/partial thyroidectomy in 45 patients , subtotal thyroidectomy in 85 , total thyroidectomy in 12 , no LN dissection in 50 , central compartment dissection in 20 , and modified radical neck dissection in 72 ) , and postoperative external beam radiation therapy was administered to 59 . Postoperative ablative therapy using I(131) was not performed in this series . Recurrence was found for regional LN ( n=25 ) , lung ( n=9 ) , remnant thyroid ( n=5 ) , and others ( n=4 ) . DFS and CSS at 40years were 74.1 and 97.5% , respectively . DFS was significantly worse in patients aged <16years with a family history of thyroid cancer , preoperative neck gross LN metastasis , maximum tumor diameter , and extrathyroidal invasion . Preoperative gross neck LN metastasis and distant metastasis at diagnosis were significant factors for CSS . No other factors contributed to DFS and CSS . When the clinical features of children and adolescents were compared , the incidence of preoperative gross neck LN metastasis and distant metastasis at diagnosis and tumors with a maximum diameter >10mm were significantly higher in the children group than in the adolescent group . DFS was significantly shorter in the children group than in the adolescent group , but no significant difference was found in CSS between these two groups . CONCLUSIONS The prognosis of PTC in children and adolescents is excellent , regardless of the extent of thyroidectomy and LN dissection . We recommend that only children or adolescents with preoperative gross neck LN metastasis and distant metastasis at diagnosis should be subjected to postoperative ablative therapy .
Cigarette smoking is implicated in numerous diseases , including emphysema and lung cancer . The clinical expression of lung disease in smokers is not well explained by currently defined variations in gene expression or simple differences in smoking exposure . Alveolar macrophages play a critical role in the inflammation and remodeling of the lung parenchyma in smoking-related lung disease . Significant gene expression changes in alveolar macrophages from smokers have been identified . However , the mechanism for these changes remains unknown . One potential mechanism for smoking-altered gene expression is via changes in cytosine methylation in DNA regions proximal to gene-coding sequences . In this study , alveolar macrophage DNA from heavy smokers and never smokers was isolated and methylation status at 25,000 loci determined . We found differential methylation in genes from immune-system and inflammatory pathways . Analysis of matching gene expression data demonstrated a parallel enrichment for changes in immune-system and inflammatory pathways . A significant number of genes with smoking-altered mRNA expression had inverse changes in methylation status . One gene highlighted by this data was the FLT1 , and further studies found particular up-regulation of a splice variant encoding a soluble inhibitory form of the receptor . In conclusion , chronic cigarette smoke exposure altered DNA methylation in specific gene promoter regions in human alveolar macrophages .
Identification of molecular target(s) and mechanism(s) of silica-induced pulmonary toxicity is important for the intervention and/or prevention of diseases associated with exposure to silica . Rats were exposed to crystalline silica by inhalation ( 15 mg m(-3) , 6 h per day , 5 days ) and global gene expression profile was determined in the lungs by microarray analysis at 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 weeks following termination of silica exposure . The number of significantly differentially expressed genes ( >1.5-fold change and <0.01 false discovery rate P-value ) detected in the lungs during the post-exposure time intervals analyzed exhibited a steady increase in parallel with the progression of silica-induced pulmonary toxicity noticed in the rats . Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of a representative set of 10 genes confirmed the microarray findings . The number of biological functions , canonical pathways and molecular networks significantly affected by silica exposure , as identified by the bioinformatics analysis of the significantly differentially expressed genes detected during the post-exposure time intervals , also exhibited a steady increase similar to the silica-induced pulmonary toxicity . Genes involved in oxidative stress , inflammation , respiratory diseases , cancer , and tissue remodeling and fibrosis were significantly differentially expressed in the rat lungs ; however , unresolved inflammation was the single most significant biological response to pulmonary exposure to silica . Excessive mucus production , as implicated by significant overexpression of the pendrin coding gene , SLC26A4 , was identified as a potential novel mechanism for silica-induced pulmonary toxicity . Collectively , the findings of our study provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of crystalline silica-induced pulmonary toxicity in the rat . Published 2012 . This article is a US Government work and is in the public domain in the USA .
Cancer cells exhibit altered glucose metabolism characterized by a preference for aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect , and the cells resist matrix detachment-induced apoptosis , which is called anoikis , a barrier to metastasis . It remains largely unclear whether tumor metabolism influences anoikis and metastasis . Here we show that when detached from the matrix , untransformed mammary epithelial cells undergo metabolic reprogramming by markedly upregulating pyruvate dehydrogenase ( PDH ) kinase 4 ( PDK4 ) through estrogen-related receptor gamma ( ERR\u03b3 ) , thereby inhibiting PDH and attenuating the flux of glycolytic carbon into mitochondrial oxidation . To decipher the significance of this metabolic response , we found that depletion of PDK4 or activation of PDH increased mitochondrial respiration and oxidative stress in suspended cells , resulting in heightened anoikis . Conversely , overexpression of PDKs prolonged survival of cells in suspension . Therefore , decreased glucose oxidation following cell detachment confers anoikis resistance . Unlike untransformed cells , most cancer cells demonstrate reduced glucose oxidation even under attached conditions , and thus they inherently possess a survival advantage when suspended . Normalization of glucose metabolism by stimulating PDH in cancer cells restores their susceptibility to anoikis and impairs their metastatic potential . These results suggest that the Warburg effect , more specifically , diminished glucose oxidation , promotes anoikis resistance and metastasis and that PDKs are potential targets for antimetastasis therapy .
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT Previous studies have indicated that the levels of DNA damage induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by the alkylating drugs melphalan , cisplatin and carboplatin can serve as useful biomarkers predictive of the therapeutic response of cancer patients to these drugs . WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS In the present study we developed a quantitative PCR-based assay , for the measurement of DNA damage . The advantages of this methodology are based on : its far greater sensitivity ( about 250 times ) than the traditional Southern blot-based method ( the detection limit is lesions/10(6) nucleotides from the equivalent DNA of cells ) ; its simplicity and speed ( results obtained within its excellent reproducibility , with a coefficient of variance of 10-15% for different DNA preparations from similarly treated cells ; its requirement for only minute amounts of material , and ; the avoidance of radioisotope labeling . Moreover , emphasis was given to translate basic research findings into clinical practice through the validation of this assay for prediction of clinical outcome in multiple myeloma patients . AIM In order to develop and validate a simple , sensitive and rapid method for the quantitation of alkylating drug-induced DNA damage . METHODS HepG2 cells and blood samples were treated with alkylating drugs ( melphalan , cisplatin , carboplatin ) . Gene-specific damage was examined using Southern blot and a multiplex long quantitative PCR ( QPCR ) carried out in a 7\u2003kb fragment ( part of the p53 gene ) and a 0.5\u2003kb fragment ( part of the IFN-\u03b21 sequence ; internal standard ) . RESULTS The extent of PCR amplification of a p53 fragment was inversely proportional to the treatment concentrations of all anticancer drugs examined , indicating a dose-related inhibition by the DNA adducts formed . Parallel analysis of the same samples using both Southern blot and QPCR showed that the DNA adducts measured by QPCR corresponded to the interstrand cross-links in the case of melphalan , and to total drug-induced lesions in the case of the platinum drugs . The detection limit was lesions/10(6) nucleotides using DNA from cells . The method is about 250 times more sensitive than the Southern blot-based method and the reproducibility is excellent , with an intraday coefficient of variance ( CV ) of 5-9% and an interday CV of 4-12% . Application of the QPCR assay to ex vivo melphalan-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multiple myeloma patients , showed that the positive predictive value of this assay for clinical response to melphalan therapy was 92.9% . CONCLUSION The PCR-based assay developed in this study can be used for the selection of cancer patients more likely to benefit from therapeutic treatment with alkylating drugs .
The submandibular gland-derived tumor cell line SCA-9 is considered a useful tool to study the signaling pathways involved in proliferation , and their regulation , triggered by different stimuli . It is proposed that the non neuronal cholinergic system : acethylcholine , the enzymes that synthesize and degrade it , and the nicotinic and muscarinic receptors , play a key role in tumorigenesis . Here , we investigate the role of muscarinic receptors in SCA-9 cell proliferation , and the modulation of cholinergic signaling pathways exerted by the nuclear transcription factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) . The activation of cholinergic receptors by carbachol ( 10-9M ) increased cell proliferation ( P<0.001 ) . This was prevented by preincubating cells with the muscarinic antagonist atropine but not by mecamylamine , a nicotinic receptor blocker . Phospholipase C ( PLC)/nitric oxide synthase ( NOS)/arginase pathway is involved in this effect , since carbachol stimulated nitric oxide production , increased NOS2 and NOS3 expressions , urea production , and arginase II expression ( P<0.001 ) . Also , phospholipase A2 ( PLA2)/cyclooxygenase ( COX ) pathway is up-regulated in carbachol-induced SCA-9 cell proliferation , because prostaglandin E2 liberation ( P<0.001 ) is increased and COX-1 expression is turned up ( P<0.001 ) . Interactions between PLC/NOS/arginases and PLA2/COX pathways via its metabolites were detected . SCA-9 cells exhibit a constitutive activation of NF-kappaB , which regulates carbachol-induced NOS2 and 3 , arginase II and COX-1 expressions . In addition , protein kinase C is involved in the up-regulation of NOS2 and arginase II enzymes induced by carbachol via NF-kappaB . In conclusion , the activation of cholinergic receptors in SCA-9 tumor cells promotes proliferation via muscarinic effector enzymes , and reveals the participation of NF-kappaB at this step of tumorigenesis .
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors ( MPNSTs ) are sarcomas able to grow under conditions of metabolic stress caused by insufficient nutrients or oxygen . Both pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide ( PACAP ) and activity-dependent neuroprotective protein ( ADNP ) have glioprotective potential . However , whether PACAP/ADNP signaling is involved in the resistance to cell death in MPNST cells remains to be clarified . Here , we investigated the involvement of this signaling system in the survival response of MPNST cells against hydrogen peroxide ( H(2)O(2))-evoked death both in the presence of normal serum ( NS ) and in serum-starved ( SS ) cells . Results showed that ADNP levels increased time-dependently ( 6-48 h ) in SS cells . Treatment with PACAP38 ( 10(-9) to 10(-5) M ) dose-dependently increased ADNP levels in NS but not in SS cells . PAC(1)/VPAC receptor antagonists completely suppressed PACAP-stimulated ADNP increase and partially reduced ADNP expression in SS cells . NS-cultured cells exposed to H(2)O(2) showed significantly reduced cell viability ( % ) , increased p53 and caspase-3 , and DNA fragmentation , without affecting ADNP expression . Serum starvation significantly reduced H(2)O(2)-induced detrimental effects in MPNST cells , which were not further ameliorated by PACAP38 . Altogether , these finding provide evidence for the involvement of an endogenous PACAP-mediated ADNP signaling system that increases MPNST cell resistance to H(2)O(2)-induced death upon serum starvation .
Background : Green tea catechins possess a wide range of pharmacological properties , including antiviral , anti-infective , and immunostimulatory properties . They also have demonstrated inhibitory effects on a variety of enzymatic and metabolic pathways involved in cancer development . Catechins have been shown to have antiproliferative properties in various cell lines and may have direct virucidal effect . The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved a topical ointment formulation of sinecatechins , derived from green tea catechins and other tea components , for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts . The exact mechanism of action of sinecatechins in eradication of human papillomavirus-induced external genital and perianal warts is unknown , but may be due to one or more of the mechanisms mentioned . Objective : This study was conducted to investigate the growth inhibitory potential of the sinecatechins in human cervical carcinoma cell lines infected with human papillomavirus . Methods : The viability of tumor cell lines ( CaSki and SiHa infected with human papillomavirus-16 ; HeLa and C4-I infected with human papillomavirus-18 ) was investigated as one parameter in a short-term viability assay ( 48 hours ) . This was followed by a long-term clonogenic assay ( 12-23 days ) to determine the cytotoxic potential of sinecatechins as a parameter for cell viability and proliferation . This assay determined if the effect observed in the viability assay was due to retardation in cell proliferation or to a reduction of total cell number , leading to cell death . Results : Based on the data collected , sinecatechins inhibited cell growth in all four tumor cell lines by 50 percent ( GI(50) ) at concentrations ranging from 160 to 360<FFFD>M . C4-I cells were the most sensitive to treatment with sinecatechins , with a lower GI(50) ( Total GI was achieved in a 48-hour assay at 625<FFFD>M sinecatechins ( 40<FFFD>M for C4-I ) , with growth inhibitory potential detectable after one hour . Clonogenic assays confirmed the cytotoxic potential of sinecatechins with a reduction in clone numbers in a concentration-dependent fashion . Sinecatechins substantially reduced the number of surviving HeLa cells at a concentration of 200<FFFD>M , while surviving SiHa cells were almost totally eradicated with a concentration of 600<FFFD>M . Conclusion : Sinecatechins demonstrated growth inhibitory potential in all four human papillomavirus-infected tumor cell lines , which may be attributed to the induction of apoptosis , mediated by cell cycle deregulation . In addition , this antiproliferative effect may contribute to the overall cancer-preventative function and possible direct antiviral activity of sinecatechins that may contribute to external genital and perianal warts clearance .
The spatial chromatin organisation and molecular interactions within and between chromatin domains and chromosome territories ( CTs ) are essential for fundamental processes such as replication , transcription and DNA repair via homologous recombination . To analyse the distribution and interaction of whole CTs , centromeres , ( sub)telomeres and interstitial chromatin segments in endopolyploid nuclei , specific FISH probes from Arabidopsis thaliana were applied to 2-64C differentiated leaf nuclei . Whereas CTs occupy a distinct and defined volume of the nucleus and do not obviously intermingle with each other in 2-64C nuclei , sister chromatin segments within these CTs become more non-cohesive with increasing endopolyploidy . Centromeres , preferentially located at the nuclear periphery , may show ring- or half-moon like shapes in 2C and 4C nuclei . Sister centromeres tend to associate up to the 8C level . From 16C nuclei on , they become progressively separated . The higher the polyploidy level gets , the more separate chromatids are present . Due to sister chromatid separation in highly endopolyploid nuclei , the centromeric histone variant CENH3 , the 180-bp centromeric repeats and pericentromeric heterochromatin form distinct subdomains at adjacent but not intermingling positions . The ( sub)telomeres are frequently associated with each other and with the nucleolus and less often with centromeres . The extent of chromatid separation and of chromatin decondensation at subtelomeric chromatin segments varies between chromosome arms . A mainly random distribution and similar shapes of CTs even at higher ploidy levels indicate that in general no substantial CT reorganisation occurs during endopolyploidisation . Non-cohesive sister chromatid regions at chromosome arms and at the ( peri)centromere are accompanied by a less dense chromatin conformation in highly endopolyploid nuclei . We discuss the possible function of this conformation in comparison to transcriptionally active regions at insect polytene chromosomes .
OBJECTIVE Expression of N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 ( NDRG1)/Cap43 is a prognostic indicator of human malignancies according to the tumor type in which it occurs . We investigated how NDRG1/Cap43 could affect tumor growth and angiogenesis in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) in vivo using an animal experimental model , and also how it could affect tumor angiogenesis and prognosis in NSCLC patients . METHODS AND RESULTS Knockdown of NDRG1/Cap43 in lung cancer cells using a specific small interfering RNA resulted in growth rates in culture that were similar to those of counterpart control cells , but decreased tumor growth rates in vivo markedly . Stable NDRG1/Cap43 knockdown did not induce consistent changes in the expression of Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) family proteins and c-Met in two human lung cancer cell lines in vitro . However , cell lines with NDRG1/Cap43 knockdown showed markedly decreased production of the potent angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor-A and interleukin-8 . Cells with knockdown of NDRG1/Cap43 showed marked reduction of tumor-induced angiogenesis . Using immunohistochemistry , we examined 182 surgically resected specimens of NSCLC for expression of NDRG1/Cap43 and tumor angiogenesis . High microvessel density in the tumor was significantly associated with nuclear positivity for NDRG1/Cap43 in both adenocarcinoma ( p = 0.003 ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( p=0.041 ) . For both adenocarcinoma ( p = 0.031 ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( p=0.034 ) , the survival curve of patients negative for nuclear NDRG1/Cap43 expression differed significantly from that of patients who were positive . CONCLUSION Therefore , the expression of NDRG1/Cap43 may be predictive of tumor angiogenesis and poor prognosis in NSCLC .
In order to prevent photodestruction by high light , photosynthetic organisms have evolved a number of mechanisms , known as non-photochemical quenching ( NPQ ) , that deactivate the excited states of light harvesting pigments . Here we investigate the NPQ mechanism in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp . PCC 6803 mutant deficient in both photosystems . Using non-linear laser fluorimetry , we have determined molecular photophysical characteristics of phycocyanin and spectrally distinct forms of allophycocyanin for the cells in non-quenched and quenched states . Our analysis of non-linear fluorescence characteristics revealed that NPQ activation leads to an decrease in the relaxation times of both allophycocyanin fluorescence components , F660 and F680 , and a 5-fold decrease in the effective excitation cross-section of F680 , suggesting an emergence of a pathway of energy dissipation for both types of allophycocyanin . In contrast , NPQ does not affect the rates of singlet-singlet exciton annihilation . This indicates that , upon NPQ activation , the excess excitation energy is transferred from allophycocyanins to quencher molecules ( presumably 3'hydroxyechinenone in the orange carotenoid protein ) , rather than being dissipated due to conformational changes of chromophores within the phycobilisome core . Kinetic measurements of fluorescence quenching in the Synechocystis mutant revealed the presence of several stages in NPQ development , as previously observed in the wild type . However , the lack of photosystems in the mutant enhanced the magnitude of NPQ as compared to the wild type , and allowed us to better characterize this process . Our results suggest a more complex kinetics of the NPQ process , thus clarifying a multistep model for the formation of the quenching center .
Doxorubicin ( DOX ) is one of the most powerful and widely prescribed chemotherapeutic agents to treat divergent human cancers . However , the clinical use of DOX is restricted due to its severe cardiotoxic side-effects . There has been ongoing search for cardioprotectants against DOX toxicity . Inorganic nitrate has emerged as a bioactive compound that can be reduced into nitrite and nitric oxide in vivo and in turn plays a therapeutic role in diseases associated with nitric oxide insufficiency or dysregulation . In this review , we describe a novel concept of using dietary supplementation of inorganic nitrate to reduce DOX-induced cardiac cellular damage and dysfunction , based on our recent promising studies in a mouse model of DOX cardiotoxicity . Our data show that chronic oral ingestion of sodium nitrate , at a dose equivalent to of the Acceptable Daily Intake of the World Health Organization , alleviated DOX-induced left ventricular dysfunction and mitochondrial respiratory chain damage . Such cardioprotective effects were associated with reduction of cardiomyocyte necrosis/apoptosis , tissue lipid peroxidation , and mitochondrial H(2)O(2) generation following DOX treatment . Furthermore , proteomic studies revealed enhanced cardiac expression of mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme - peroxiredoxin 5 in the nitrate-treated animals . These studies suggest that inorganic nitrate could be an inexpensive therapeutic agent for long-term oral administration in preventing DOX-induced cardiac toxicity and myopathy during the prolonged pathological process . Future clinical trials in the cancer patients undergoing DOX chemotherapy are warranted to translate these experimental findings into an effective new therapy in preventing the DOX-induced cardiomyopathy .
Piceatannol is a stilbenoid , a metabolite of resveratrol found in red wine . Piceatannol and sera from rats orally given piceatannol were found to dose-dependently suppress both the proliferation and invasion of AH109A hepatoma cells in culture . Its antiproliferative effect was based on cell cycle arrest at lower concentration ( 25 muM ) and on apoptosis induction at higher concentration ( 100 muM ) . Piceatannol suppressed reactive oxygen species-potentiated invasive capacity by scavenging the intracellular reactive oxygen species . These results suggest that piceatannol , unlike resveratrol , has a potential to suppress the hepatoma proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction . They also suggest that the antioxidative property of piceatannol , like resveratrol , may be involved in its anti-invasive action . Subsequently , piceatannol was found to suppress the growth of solid tumor and metastasis in hepatoma-bearing rats . Thus , piceatannol may be a useful anticancer natural product .
Human NEIL2 , one of five oxidized base-specific DNA glycosylases , is unique in preferentially repairing oxidative damage in transcribed genes . Here we show that depletion of NEIL2 causes a 6-7-fold increase in spontaneous mutation frequency in the HPRT gene of the V79 Chinese hamster lung cell line . This prompted us to screen for NEIL2 variants in lung cancer patients ' genomic DNA . We identified several polymorphic variants , among which R103Q and R257L were frequently observed in lung cancer patients . We then characterized these variants biochemically , and observed a modest decrease in DNA glycosylase activity relative to the wild type ( WT ) only with the R257L mutant protein . However , in reconstituted repair assays containing WT NEIL2 or its R257L and R103Q variants together with other DNA base excision repair ( BER ) proteins ( PNKP , Pol\u03b2 , Lig III\u03b1 and XRCC1 ) or using NEIL2-FLAG immunocomplexes , an decrease in repair was observed with the R257L variant compared to WT or R103Q NEIL2 , apparently due to the R257L mutant's lower affinity for other repair proteins , particularly Pol\u03b2 . Notably , increased endogenous DNA damage was observed in NEIL2 variant ( R257L)-expressing cells relative to WT cells . Taken together , our results suggest that the decreased DNA repair capacity of the R257L variant can induce mutations that lead to lung cancer development .
PURPOSE The ability to accurately predict the likelihood of expansion of the CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene to a full mutation is of critical importance for genetic counseling of women who are carriers of premutation alleles ( 55-200 CGG repeats ) and who are weighing the risk of having a child with fragile X syndrome . The presence of AGG interruptions within the CGG repeat tract is thought to decrease the likelihood of expansion to a full mutation during transmission , thereby reducing risk , although their contribution has not been quantified . METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 267 premutation alleles for number and position of AGG interruptions , length of pure CGG repeats , and CGG repeat lengths present in the offspring of the maternal transmissions . In addition , we determined the haplotypes of four markers flanking the 5'-UTR locus in the premutation mothers . RESULTS We found that the presence of AGG interruptions significantly increased genetic stability , whereas specific haplotypes had a marginal association with transmission instability . CONCLUSION The presence of AGG interruptions reduced the risk of transmission of a full mutation for all maternal ( premutation ) repeat lengths below CGG repeats , with a differential risk ( 0 vs. 2 AGG ) exceeding 60% for alleles in the 70- to 80-CGG repeat range .
A variety of reduced-intensity conditionings have been used in the reported studies of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) for elderly patients with myeloid hematological malignancies . This study retrospectively analyzed the outcome of allogeneic HSCT for 10 patients aged 50 years or older with myeloid hematological malignancies after conditioning with fludarabine ( 125 mg/m(2) ) , melphalan ( 140 mg/m(2) ) and total body irradiation ( TBI ; 8 Gy ) . Median age of the patients was 56.5 years , and diagnoses included acute myelogenous leukemia , advance myelodysplastic syndrome , and secondary myelofibrosis . Sources of stem cells were bone marrow from sibling ( n=4 ) or unrelated donor ( n=6 ) . Both overall and disease-free survival rates were 40.0% ( 95% CI : 10.6 Causes of death were relapse ( n=2 ) , fungal infection ( n=2 ) , and secondary malignancies ( n=2 ) . Because of a high incidence of transplant-related mortality , further refinement of this conditioning is required .
BACKGROUND Brain-metastatic breast cancer ( BMBC ) is increasing and poses a severe clinical problem because of the lack of effective treatments and because the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown . Recent work has demonstrated that deregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) may correlate with BMBC progression . However , the exact contribution that EGFR makes to BMBC remains unclear . METHODS The role of EGFR in BMBC was explored by serial analyses in a brain-trophic clone of human MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells ( 231-BR cells ) . EGFR expression was inhibited by stable short-hairpin RNA transfection or by the kinase inhibitor erlotinib , and it was activated by heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) . Cell growth and invasion activities also were analyzed in vitro and in vivo . RESULTS EGFR inhibition or activation strongly affected 231-BR cell migration/invasion activities as assessed by an adhesion assay , a wound-healing assay , a Boyden chamber invasion assay , and cytoskeleton staining . Also , EGFR inhibition significantly decreased brain metastases of 231-BR cells in vivo . Surprisingly , changes to EGFR expression affected cell proliferation activities less significantly as determined by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay , an anchorage-independent growth assay , and cell cycle analysis . Immunoblot analysis suggested that EGFR drives cells ' invasiveness capability mainly through phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B and phospholipase C gamma downstream pathways . In addition , EGFR was involved less in proliferation because of the insensitivity of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway . CONCLUSIONS The current results indicated that EGFR plays more important roles in cell migration and invasion to the brain than in cell proliferation progression on 231-BR cells , providing new evidence of the potential value of EGFR inhibition in treating BMBC .
The Salmonella type III secretion system ( T3SS ) efficiently translocates heterologous proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells . This leads to an antigen-specific CD8 T-cell induction in mice orally immunized with recombinant Salmonella . Recently , we have used Salmonella's T3SS as a prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against a murine fibrosarcoma . In this study , we constructed a recombinant Salmonella strain translocating the immunogenic H-2D(b)-specific CD8 T-cell epitope VILTNPISM ( KDR2 ) from the murine vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) . VEGFR2 is a member of the tyrosine protein kinase family and is upregulated on proliferating endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature . After single orogastric vaccination , we detected significant numbers of KDR2-tetramer-positive CD8 T cells in the spleens of immunized mice . The efficacy of these cytotoxic T cells was evaluated in a prophylactic setting to protect mice from challenges with B16F10 melanoma cells in a flank tumor model , and to reduce dissemination of spontaneous pulmonary melanoma metastases . Vaccinated mice revealed a reduction of angiogenesis by 62% in the solid tumor and consequently a significant decrease of tumor growth as compared to non-immunized mice . Moreover , in the lung metastasis model , immunization with recombinant Salmonella resulted in a reduction of the metastatic melanoma burden by approximately 60% .
Fus1 , encoded by a 3p21.3 tumour suppressor gene , is down-regulated , mutated or lost in the majority of inflammatory thoracic malignancies . The mitochondrial localization of Fus1 stimulated us to investigate how Fus1 modulates inflammatory response and mitochondrial function in a mouse model of asbestos-induced peritoneal inflammation . Asbestos treatment resulted in a decreased Fus1 expression in wild-type ( WT ) peritoneal immune cells , suggesting that asbestos exposure may compromise the Fus1-mediated inflammatory response . Untreated Fus1(-/-) mice had an higher proportion of peritoneal granulocytes than Fus1(+/+) mice , pointing at ongoing chronic inflammation . Fus1(-/-) mice exhibited a perturbed inflammatory response to asbestos , reflected in decreased immune organ weight and peritoneal fluid protein concentration , along with an increased proportion of peritoneal macrophages . Fus1(-/-) immune cells showed augmented asbestos-induced activation of key inflammatory , anti-oxidant and genotoxic stress response proteins ERK1/2 , NFkappaB , SOD2 , gammaH2AX , etc . Moreover , Fus1(-/-) mice demonstrated altered dynamics of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression , such as IFNgamma , TNFalpha , IL-1A , IL-1B and IL-10 . ' Late ' response cytokine Ccl5 was persistently under-expressed in Fus1(-/-) immune cells at both basal and asbestos-activated states . We observed an asbestos-related difference in the size of CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) DN T cell subset that was expanded four-fold in Fus1(-/-) mice . Finally , we demonstrated Fus1-dependent basal and asbestos-induced changes in major mitochondrial parameters ( ROS production , mitochondrial potential and UCP2 expression ) in Fus1(-/-) immune cells and in Fus1-depleted cancer cells , thus supporting our hypothesis that Fus1 establishes its immune- and tumour-suppressive activities via regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis .
Neurofibromatosis type 2 patients develop schwannomas , meningiomas and ependymomas resulting from mutations in the tumor suppressor gene , NF2 , encoding a membrane-cytoskeleton adapter protein called merlin . Merlin regulates contact inhibition of growth and controls the availability of growth factor receptors at the cell surface . We tested if microtubule-based vesicular trafficking might be a mechanism by which merlin acts . We found that schwannoma cells , containing merlin mutations and constitutive activation of the Rho/Rac family of GTPases , had decreased intracellular vesicular trafficking relative to normal human Schwann cells . In Nf2-/- mouse Schwann ( SC4 ) cells , re-expression of merlin as well as inhibition of Rac or its effector kinases , MLK and p38(SAPK) , each increased the velocity of Rab6 positive exocytic vesicles . Conversely , an activated Rac mutant decreased Rab6 vesicle velocity . Vesicle motility assays in isolated squid axoplasm further demonstrated that both mutant merlin and active Rac specifically reduce anterograde microtubule-based transport of vesicles dependent upon the activity of p38(SAPK) kinase . Taken together , our data suggest loss of merlin results in the Rac-dependent decrease of anterograde trafficking of exocytic vesicles , representing a possible mechanism controlling the concentration of growth factor receptors at the cell surface .
Sustained release of copper ( Cu ) ions from Cu-containing intrauterine devices ( CuIUD ) is quite efficient for contraception . However , the tissue surrounding the CuIUD is exposed to toxic Cu ion levels . The objective for this study was to quantify the concentration dependent cytotoxic effects of Cu ions and correlate the toxicity due to Cu ion burst release for two popular T-shaped IUDs - TCu380A and TCu220C on L929 mouse fibroblasts . Fibroblasts were cultured in 98 well tissue culture plates and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphehyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay was used to determine their viability and proliferation as a function of time . For cell seeding numbers ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 , a maximum culture time of 48 h was identified for fibroblasts without significant reduction in cell proliferation due to contact inhibition . Thus , for Cu cytotoxicity assays , a cell seeding density of 50,000 and a maximum culture time of 48 h in 96 well plates were used. 24 h after cell seeding , culture media were replaced with Cu ion containing media solutions of different concentrations , including 24 and 72 h extracts from TCuIUDs and incubated for a further 24 h . Cell viability decreased with increasing Cu ion concentration , with 30 % and 100 % reduction for 40 \u03bcg/ml and 100 \u03bcg/ml respectively at 24 h . The cytotoxic effects were further evaluated using light microscopy , apoptosis and cell cycle analysis assays . Fibroblasts became rounded and eventually detached from TCP surface due to Cu ion toxicity . A linear increase in apoptotic cell population with increasing Cu ion concentration was observed in the tested range of 0 to 50 \u03bcg/ml . Cell cycle analysis indicated the arrest of cell division for the tested 25 to 50 \u03bcg/ml Cu ion treatments . Among the TCuIUDs , TCu220C having 265 mm(2) Cu surface area released 9.08 +/- 0.16 and 26.02 +/- 0.25 \u03bcg/ml , while TCu380A having 400 mm(2) released 96.7 +/- 0.11 and 159.3 +/- 0.15 \u03bcg/ml respectively following 24 and 72 h extractions . The effects of TCuIUD extracts on viability , morphology , apoptosis and cell cycle assay on L929 mouse fibroblasts cells , were appropriate for their respective Cu ion concentrations . Thus , a concentration of about 46 \u03bcg/ml ( \u03bcM ) was identified as the LD50 dose for L929 mouse fibroblasts when exposed for 24 h based on our MTT cell viability assay . The burst release of lethal concentration of Cu ions from TCu380A , especially at the implant site , is a cause of concern , and it is advisable to use TCuIUD designs that release Cu ions within cytotoxic limits yet therapeutic , similar to TCu220C .
AIM We studied expression of molecules of the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) pathway and its relation to vascularization , cell proliferation and patient outcome in recurring non-anaplastic meningioma . We studied 29 tumor specimens of 8 patients with recurring meningiomas and of 8 age- and gender-matched control patients with non-recurring meningiomas ( including meningothelial , transitional , fibroblastic and atypical subtypes ) using immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization . RESULTS VEGF protein , VEGF-mRNA , VEGF receptor ( VEGFR)-1 mRNA , VEGFR-2 mRNA and hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF)-1-alpha protein were expressed in 27/29 ( 93% ) , 20/27 ( 74% ) , 9/27 ( 33.3% ) , 12/27 ( 44.4% ) and 5/29 ( 17.2% ) specimens , respectively . VEGFR- 2 mRNA expression was found in 6/8 tumors extracted at first operation in patients with recurring tumors and in none of the control cases ( p = 0.007 ) . Microvessel density ( MVD ) and Ki-67 index values were generally higher in meningiomas with expression of angiogenic factors . The association of high Ki-67 index values with VEGF-mRNA expression was significant ( p = 0.04 ) . Time to recurrence was shorter in patients with high MVD than in patients with low MVD ( p = 0.027 ) . CONCLUSIONS High MVD correlates with unfavorable prognosis in our series of recurring meningioma . VEGF and its receptors are frequently expressed in meningiomas and seem important for tumor growth and recurrence . Thus , anti-VEGF therapy in aggressive meningioma seems rational from a pathobiological point of view .
We have identified a rare small ( kb unique sequence ) recurrent deletion in a previously linked attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) locus at 2q21.1 in five unrelated families with developmental delay ( DD)/intellectual disability ( ID ) , ADHD , epilepsy and other neurobehavioral abnormalities from 17 035 samples referred for clinical chromosomal microarray analysis . Additionally , a DECIPHER ( http://decipher.sanger.ac.uk ) patient 2311 was found to have the same deletion and presented with aggressive behavior . The deletion was not found in either six control groups consisting of 13 999 healthy individuals or in the DGV database . We have also identified reciprocal duplications in five unrelated families with autism , developmental delay ( DD ) , seizures and ADHD . This genomic region is flanked by large , complex low-copy repeats ( LCRs ) with directly oriented subunits of kb in size that have 97.7% DNA sequence identity . We sequenced the deletion breakpoints within the directly oriented paralogous subunits of the flanking LCR clusters , demonstrating non-allelic homologous recombination as a mechanism of formation . The rearranged segment harbors five genes : GPR148 , FAM123C , ARHGEF4 , FAM168B and PLEKHB2 . Expression of ARHGEF4 ( Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 4 ) is restricted to the brain and may regulate the actin cytoskeletal network , cell morphology and migration , and neuronal function . GPR148 encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor protein expressed in the brain and testes . We suggest that small rare recurrent deletion of 2q21.1 is pathogenic for DD/ID , ADHD , epilepsy and other neurobehavioral abnormalities and , because of its small size , low frequency and more severe phenotype might have been missed in other previous genome-wide screening studies using single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses .
Even when patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer undergo surgical resection at an early stage , recurrent disease often impairs the clinical outcome . There are numerous causes potentially responsible for a relapse of the disease , one of them being extensive angiogenesis . The balance of at least two systems , VEGF VEGFR and Ang Tie , regulates vessel formation . The aim of this study was to determine the impact of surgery on the plasma levels of the main angiogenic factors during the first month after surgery in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients . The study group consisted of 37 patients with stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer . Plasma concentrations of Ang1 , Ang2 , sTie2 , VEGF , and sVEGF R1 were evaluated by ELISA three times : before surgical resection and on postoperative days 7 and 30 . The median of Ang2 and VEGF concentrations increased on postoperative day 7 and decreased on day 30 . On the other hand , the concentration of sTie2 decreased on the 7th day after resection and did not change statistically later on . The concentrations of Ang1 and sVEGF R1 did not change after the surgery . Lung cancer resection results in proangiogenic plasma protein changes that may stimulate tumor recurrences and metastases after early resection .
Post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin ( Ub ) regulates a host of cellular processes , including protein quality control , DNA repair , endocytosis , and cellular signaling . In the ubiquitination cascade , a thioester-linked conjugate between the C-terminus of Ub and the active site cysteine of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ( E2 ) is formed . The E2 conjugate interacts with a ubiquitin ligase ( E3 ) to transfer Ub to a lysine residue on a target protein . The flexibly linked E2 conjugates have been shown to form a range of structures in solution . In addition , select E2 conjugates oligomerize through a noncovalent " backside " interaction between Ub and E2 components of different conjugates . Additional studies are needed to bridge the gap between the dynamic monomeric conjugates , E2 oligomers , and the mechanisms of ubiquitination . We present a new 2.35 A crystal structure of an oligomeric UbcH5c conjugate . The conjugate forms a staggered linear oligomer that differs substantially from the " infinite spiral " helical arrangement of the only previously reported structure of an oligomeric conjugate . Our structure also differs in intraconjugate conformation from other structurally characterized conjugates . Despite these differences , we find that the backside interaction mode is conserved in different conjugate oligomers and is independent of intraconjugate relative E2-Ub orientations . We delineate a common intraconjugate E2-binding surface on Ub . In addition , we demonstrate that an E3 CHIP ( carboxyl terminus of Hsp70 interacting protein ) interacts directly with UbcH5c oligomers , not only with conjugate monomers . These results provide insights into the conformational diversity of E2 conjugates and conjugate oligomers , and into their compatibility and interactions with E3s , which have important consequences for the ubiquitination process .
Heterodimeric hCG is one of the key hormones determining early pregnancy success . We have previously identified rare missense mutations in hCG\u03b2 genes with potential pathophysiological importance . The present study assessed the impact of these mutations on the structure and function of hCG by applying a combination of in silico ( sequence and structure analysis , molecular dynamics ) and in vitro ( co-immunoprecipitation , immuno- and bioassays ) approaches . The carrier status of each mutation was determined for 1086 North-Europeans [ 655 patients with recurrent miscarriage ( RM)/431 healthy controls from Estonia , Finland and Denmark ] using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism . The mutation CGB5 p.Val56Leu ( rs72556325 ) was identified in a single heterozygous RM patient and caused a structural hindrance in the formation of the hCG\u03b1/\u03b2 dimer . Although the amount of the mutant hCG\u03b2 assembled into secreted intact hCG was only 10% compared with the wild-type , a stronger signaling response was triggered upon binding to its receptor , thus compensating the effect of poor dimerization . The mutation CGB8 p.Pro73Arg ( rs72556345 ) was found in five heterozygotes ( three RM cases and two control individuals ) and was inherited by two of seven studied live born children . The mutation caused of secreted \u03b2-subunits to acquire an alternative conformation , but did not affect its biological activity . For the CGB8 p.Arg8Trp ( rs72556341 ) substitution , the applied in vitro methods revealed no alterations in the assembly of intact hCG as also supported by an in silico analysis . In summary , the accumulated data indicate that only mutations with neutral or mild functional consequences might be tolerated in the major hCG\u03b2 genes CGB5 and CGB8 .
Continuous exposure to high concentrations of hexavalent chromium [ Cr(VI) ] in drinking water results in intestinal tumors in mice but not rats . Concentration-dependent gene expression effects were evaluated in female F344 rat duodenal and jejunal epithelia following 7 and 90 days of exposure to 0.3-520 mg/L ( as sodium dichromate dihydrate , SDD ) in drinking water . Whole-genome microarrays identified 3269 and 1815 duodenal , and 4557 and 1534 jejunal differentially expressed genes at 8 and 91 days , respectively , with significant overlaps between the intestinal segments . Functional annotation identified gene expression changes associated with oxidative stress , cell cycle , cell death , and immune response that were consistent with reported changes in redox status and histopathology . Comparative analysis with B6C3F1 mouse data from a similarly designed study identified 2790 differentially expressed rat orthologs in the duodenum compared to 5013 mouse orthologs at day 8 , and only 1504 rat and 3484 mouse orthologs at day 91 . Automated dose-response modeling resulted in similar median EC50s in the rodent duodenal and jejunal mucosae . Comparative examination of differentially expressed genes also identified divergently regulated orthologs . Comparable numbers of differentially expressed genes were observed at equivalent Cr concentrations ( mug Cr/g duodenum ) . However , mice accumulated higher Cr levels than rats at >= 170 mg/L SDD , resulting in a increase in the number of differentially expressed genes . These qualitative and quantitative differences in differential gene expression , which correlate with differences in tissue dose , likely contribute to the disparate intestinal tumor outcomes .
OBJECTIVE Chemotherapy options for advanced endometrial cancer are limited and newer therapeutic agents are urgently needed . This study describes the therapeutic potential of 7 Methyl-indole ethyl isothiocyanate ( 7Me-IEITC ) in endometrial cancer cell lines . METHODS 7Me-IEITC was synthesized in our laboratory . The cell viability of 7Me-IEITC treated ECC-1 and KLE endometrial cancer cell was determined by MTS assay . Morphology and apoptosis were further confirmed by DAPI-staining and TUNEL assay . The measurement of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , mitochondrial transmembrane depolarization potential ( \u0394\u03a8m ) and cell cycle phase was determined by FACS analysis . Expression of proteins involved in apoptosis , survival and cell-cycle progression was analyzed by Western blotting . RESULTS 7Me-IEITC reduced the viability of the ECC-1 and KLE cancer cell-lines ( IC(50) \u03bcM ) in a dose dependent fashion. 7Me-IEITC treatment caused mitochondrial transmembrane potential reduction , elevated the production of ROS , leading to activation of apoptosis in endometrial cancer KLE and ECC-1 cells. 7Me-IEITC treatment activated Bad , suppressed Bcl2 phosphorylation followed by PARP-1 deactivation and caspase 3 and 7 activation. 7Me-IEITC treatment arrested the progression of KLE cells in S-phase and caused CDC25 and cyclin-D1 downregulation . Pre-treatment with ascorbic acid abrogated 7Me-IEITC induced apoptosis in ECC-1 and KLE cells , suggesting that 7Me-IEITC mediated cytotoxicity is primarily through ROS production . CONCLUSION 7Me-IEITC demonstrated promising cytotoxic effects in endometrial cancer cell line model .
Multiprotein complexes , called editosomes , catalyze the uridine insertion and deletion RNA editing that forms translatable mitochondrial mRNAs in kinetoplastid parasites . We have identified here two new U1-like zinc finger proteins that associate with editosomes and have shown that they are related to KREPB6 , KREPB7 , and KREPB8 , and thus we have named them Kinetoplastid RNA Editing Proteins , KREPB9 and KREPB10 . They are conserved and syntenic in trypanosomatids although KREPB10 is absent in Trypanosoma vivax and both are absent in Leishmania . Tandem affinity purification ( TAP)-tagged KREPB9 and KREPB10 incorporate into editosomes and/or subcomplexes thereof and preferentially associate with deletion subcomplexes , as do KREPB6 , KREPB7 , and KREPB8 . KREPB10 also associates with editosomes that are isolated via a chimeric endonuclease , KREN1 in KREPB8 RNA interference ( RNAi ) cells , or MEAT1 . The purified complexes have precleaved editing activities and endonuclease cleavage activity that appears to leave a 5 ' OH on the 3 ' product . RNAi knockdowns did not affect growth but resulted in relative reductions of both edited and unedited mitochondrial mRNAs . The similarity of KREPB9 and KREPB10 to KREPB6 , KREPB7 , and KREPB8 suggests they may be accessory factors that affect editing endonuclease activity and as a consequence may affect mitochondrial mRNA stability . KREPB9 and KREPB10 , along with KREPB6 , KREPB7 , and KREPB8 , may enable the endonucleases to discriminate among and accurately cleave hundreds of different editing sites and may be involved in the control of differential editing during the life cycle of T. brucei .
BACKGROUND Peritoneal transport status is important not only for prescription , but also as a prognostic index . Flt-1 and Flk-1 , the major vascular endothelial growth factor receptors involved in angiogenesis and hyperpermeability , may play a potent role in determining peritoneal transport characteristics . However , the relationship between them has not been studied to date . We hypothesized that Flt-1 and Flk-1 expression in the peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients could be closely related to baseline peritoneal transport status . METHODS Thirty-six new patients without a previous history of peritonitis were enrolled . Clinical parameters such as age , sex , height , weight , causes of renal failure , and residual renal function were assessed . Parietal peritoneal biopsies were obtained during implantation of peritoneal dialytic catheters . Flt-1 and Flk-1 were semi-quantitatively evaluated by immunohistochemical staining . Peritoneal microvascular density ( MVD ) was counted . Within 6 weeks after commencing peritoneal dialysis , a standard peritoneal equilibration test was performed , and the dialysate-to-plasma concentration ratio for creatinine at 4 h ( D4/P Cr ) was determined . The patients were divided into two groups based on the D4/P Cr : more than 0.65 ( Group H , n = 22 ) and less than or equal to 0.65 ( Group L , n = 14 ) . The 24-h peritoneal protein excretion ( PPE ) was assayed . Flt-1 and Flk-1 were correlated with peritoneal MVD , D4/P Cr , and PPE . RESULTS Flt-1 and Flk-1 were detected in the peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients . Flt-1 expression was similar between the two groups , but Flk-1 expression in Group H was significantly higher than that in Group L ( p = 0.001 ) . Flt-1 expression did not show significant correlations with peritoneal MVD , D4/P Cr , and PPE . However , Flk-1 expression showed significant correlations with the above three parameters ( p < 0.001 for all ) . CONCLUSIONS For the first time , the expressions of Flt-1 and Flk-1 in peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients were detected . Flk-1 expression in peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients is closely correlated with the number of peritoneal microvessels , peritoneal small solute transport rate , and PPE . Our findings strongly suggest that Flk-1 may be a crucial determinant of baseline peritoneal transport characteristics . Further interventional studies are needed .
BACKGROUND Studies comparing similar-sized species with disparate longevity may elucidate novel mechanisms that abrogate aging and prolong good health . We focus on the longest living rodent , the naked mole-rat . This mouse-sized mammal lives times longer than do mice and , despite high levels of oxidative damage evident at a young age , it is not only very resistant to spontaneous neoplasia but also shows minimal decline in age-associated physiological traits . OBJECTIVES We assess the current status of stress resistance and longevity , focusing in particular on the molecular and cellular responses to cytotoxins and other stressors between the short-lived laboratory mouse and the naked mole-rat . RESULTS Like other experimental animal models of lifespan extension , naked mole-rat fibroblasts are extremely tolerant of a broad spectrum of cytotoxins including heat , heavy metals , DNA-damaging agents and xenobiotics , showing LD(50) values between 2- and 20-fold greater than those of fibroblasts of shorter-lived mice . Our new data reveal that naked mole-rat fibroblasts stop proliferating even at low doses of toxin whereas those mouse fibroblasts that survive treatment rapidly re-enter the cell cycle and may proliferate with DNA damage . Naked mole-rat fibroblasts also show significantly higher constitutive levels of both p53 and Nrf2 protein levels and activity , and this increases even further in response to toxins . CONCLUSION Enhanced cell signaling via p53 and Nrf2 protects cells against proliferating with damage , augments clearance of damaged proteins and organelles and facilitates the maintenance of both genomic and protein integrity . These pathways collectively regulate a myriad of mechanisms which may contribute to the attenuated aging profile and sustained healthspan of the naked mole-rat . Understanding how these are regulated may be also integral to sustaining positive human healthspan well into old age and may elucidate novel therapeutics for delaying the onset and progression of physiological declines that characterize the aging process .
A new triphenylphosphine adduct of cyclopalladated ferrocenylpyridazine containing a chloride anion , 2a , has been synthesized from the reaction of the chloride-bridged palladacyclic dimer 1a with triphenylphosphine . The corresponding adducts 3a,b containing iodide anion have been readily prepared through anion exchange reactions of 2a,b with NaI in acetone . These complexes were characterized by elemental analysis , IR and 1H-NMR . Additionally , their crystal structures have been determined by X-ray diffraction and intermolecular C-H...X ( Cl , Br , I ) bonds were found in the crystals . The use of these palladacycles as catalysts for the Suzuki and Sonogashira reactions was examined . The complexes 2a,b exhibited higher catalytic activity than the corresponding 3a,b in the Suzuki reaction . However , the order of activity of adducts with varying halogen anions is 3a > 2a in the Sonogashira reaction .
Whole genome duplications ( WGDs ) are considered to have been a driving force in the generation of evolutionary diversity that is characteristic of higher eukaryotes . The ancestor of salmonids underwent two additional WGDs compared to mammals , one ( 3R ) at the base of the teleost radiation and another ( 4R ) in the common ancestor of extant salmonids . We have chosen the fatty acid binding protein ( fabp ) gene family as a model to study the fate of duplicated genes in teleosts following WGDs . As previously described for zebrafish , we identified two copies ( fabp7a and fabp7b ) of the brain-type fabp gene in several fish including rainbow smelt , but there was only a single transcript in northern pike , the closest relative of the salmonids , and two rather than the expected four fabp7 genes in Atlantic salmon , rainbow trout and grayling . A phylogenetic analysis revealed that a loss of the fabp7a gene occurred in the common ancestor of the northern pike and salmonids after it had diverged from the rainbow smelt , and that the 4R WGD then gave rise to the fabp7bI and fabp7bII observed in salmonids . This is supported by genetic mapping that placed the Atlantic salmon duplicated fabp7b genes on homeologous chromosomes . There was no evidence of neo-functionalization in the salmonid fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes based on dN/dS ratios and an examination of amino acid substitutions . Atlantic salmon fabp7bI and fabp7bII genes are both expressed broadly like fabp7b expression in northern pike . However , only Atlantic salmon fabp7bII , like its counterpart in northern pike and zebrafish , was expressed in the liver . A comparison of upstream of Atlantic salmon fabp7b gene duplicates revealed an insertion of 62bp in fabp7bI relative to fabp7bII . The presence of predicted transcription factor binding sites in this insertion sequence may explain the differential expression of the fabp7b gene duplicates in Atlantic salmon liver .
Surgery is the most effective therapy for cancer in the United States , but disease still recurs in more than 40% of patients within 5 years after resection . Chemotherapy is given postoperatively to prevent relapses ; however , this approach has had marginal success . After surgery , recurrent tumors depend on rapid neovascular proliferation to deliver nutrients and oxygen . Phosphatidylserine ( PS ) is exposed on the vascular endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment but is notably absent on blood vessels in normal tissues . Thus , PS is an attractive target for cancer therapy after surgery . Syngeneic mice bearing TC1 lung cancer tumors were treated with mch1N11 ( a novel mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets PS ) , cisplatin ( cis ) , or combination after surgery . Tumor relapses and disease progression were decreased 90% by combination therapy compared with a 50% response rate for cis alone ( P = .02 ) . Mice receiving postoperative mch1N11 had no wound-related complications or added systemic toxicity in comparison to control animals . Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the effects of mch1N11 were associated with a dense infiltration of inflammatory cells , particularly granulocytes . This strategy was independent of the adaptive immune system . Together , these data suggest that vascular-targeted strategies directed against exposed PS may be a powerful adjunct to postoperative chemotherapy in preventing relapses after cancer surgery .
The ligand-gated ion channels in the Cys-loop receptor superfamily mediate the effects of neurotransmitters acetylcholine , serotonin , GABA , and glycine . Cys-loop receptor signaling is susceptible to modulation by ligands acting through numerous allosteric sites . Here we report the discovery of a novel class of negative allosteric modulators of the 5-HT(3) receptors ( 5-HT(3)Rs ) . PU02 ( 6-[(1-naphthylmethyl)thio]-9H-purine ) is a potent and selective antagonist displaying IC(50) values of \u03bcM at 5-HT(3)Rs and substantially lower activities at other Cys-loop receptors . In an elaborate mutagenesis study of the 5-HT(3)A receptor guided by a homology model , PU02 is demonstrated to act through a transmembrane intersubunit site situated in the upper three helical turns of TM2 and TM3 in the ( +)-subunit and TM1 and TM2 in the ( -)-subunit . The Ser(248) , Leu(288) , Ile(290) , Thr(294) , and Gly(306) residues are identified as important molecular determinants of PU02 activity with minor contributions from Ser(292) and Val(310) , and we propose that the naphthalene group of PU02 docks into the hydrophobic cavity formed by these . Interestingly , specific mutations of Ser(248) , Thr(294) , and Gly(306) convert PU02 into a complex modulator , potentiating and inhibiting 5-HT-evoked signaling through these mutants at low and high concentrations , respectively . The PU02 binding site in the 5-HT(3)R corresponds to allosteric sites in anionic Cys-loop receptors , which emphasizes the uniform nature of the molecular events underlying signaling through the receptors . Moreover , the dramatic changes in the functional properties of PU02 induced by subtle changes in its binding site bear witness to the delicate structural discrimination between allosteric inhibition and potentiation of Cys-loop receptors .
The androgen receptor ( AR ) has a critical role in the growth and progression of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancers . To identify novel inhibitors of AR transactivation that block growth of prostate cancer cells , a luciferase-based high-throughput screen of small molecules was performed in cells stably expressing AR and a prostate-specific antigen ( PSA)-luciferase reporter . CPIC ( 1-(3-(2-chlorophenoxy) propyl)-1H-indole-3-carbonitrile ) was identified as a small molecule that blocks AR transactivation to a greater extent than other steroid receptors . CPIC inhibited AR-mediated proliferation of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines , with minimal toxicity in AR-negative cell lines . CPIC treatment also reduced the anchorage-independent growth of LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells . CPIC functioned as a pure antagonist by inhibiting the expression of AR-regulated genes in LAPC-4 cells that express wild-type AR and exhibited weak agonist activity in LNCaP cells that express the mutant AR-T877A . CPIC treatment did not reduce AR levels or alter its nuclear localization . We used chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify the site of action of CPIC . CPIC inhibited recruitment of androgen-bound AR to the PSA promoter and enhancer sites to a greater extent than bicalutamide . CPIC is a new therapeutic inhibitor that targets AR-mediated gene activation with potential to arrest the growth of prostate cancer .
Elevated aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells ( the Warburg effect ) may be attributed to respiration injury or mitochondrial dysfunction , but the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic significance remain elusive . Here we report that induction of mitochondrial respiratory defect by tetracycline-controlled expression of a dominant negative form of DNA polymerase \u03b3 causes a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis and increases ROS generation . We show that upregulation of NOX is critical to support the elevated glycolysis by providing additional NAD+ . The upregulation of NOX is also consistently observed in cancer cells with compromised mitochondria due to the activation of oncogenic Ras or loss of p53 , and in primary pancreatic cancer tissues . Suppression of NOX by chemical inhibition or genetic knockdown of gene expression selectively impacts cancer cells with mitochondrial dysfunction , leading to a decrease in cellular glycolysis , a loss of cell viability , and inhibition of cancer growth in vivo . Our study reveals a previously unrecognized function of NOX in cancer metabolism and suggests that NOX is a potential novel target for cancer treatment .
Contact-inhibition ubiquitously exists in non-transformed cells and explains the poor regenerative capacity of in vivo human retinal pigment epithelial cells ( RPE ) during aging , injury and diseases . RPE injury or degeneration may unlock mitotic block mediated by contact inhibition but may also promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) contributing to retinal blindness . Herein , we confirmed that EMT ensued in post-confluent ARPE-19 cells when contact inhibition was disrupted with EGTA followed by addition of EGF and FGF-2 because of activation of canonical Wnt and Smad/ZEB signaling . In contrast , knockdown of p120-catenin ( p120 ) unlocked such mitotic block by activating p120/Kaiso , but not activating canonical Wnt and Smad/ZEB signaling , thus avoiding EMT . Nuclear BrdU labeling was correlated with nuclear release of Kaiso through p120 nuclear translocation , which was associated with activation of RhoA-ROCK signaling , destabilization of microtubules . Prolonged p120 siRNA knockdown followed by withdrawal further expanded RPE into more compact monolayers with a normal phenotype and a higher density . This new strategy based on selective activation of p120/Kaiso but not Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling obviates the need of using single cells and the risk of EMT , and may be deployed to engineer surgical grafts containing RPE and other tissues .
Reversine is a small synthetic molecule that inhibits multiple mitotic kinases , including MPS1 as well as Aurora kinase A and B ( AURKA and AURKB ) . Here , we investigated the effects of reversine on p53-deficient vs p53-proficient cancer cells . We found that low doses ( <FFFD>M ) of reversine , which selectively inhibit MPS1 and hence impair the spindle assembly checkpoint , kill human TP53 ( -/- ) colon carcinoma cells less efficiently than their wild-type counterparts . In sharp contrast , high doses ( <FFFD>M ) of reversine induced hyperploidization and apoptosis to a much larger extent in TP53 ( -/- ) than in TP53 ( +/+ ) cells . Such a selective cytotoxicity could not be reproduced by the knockdown of MPS1 , AURKA and AURKB , neither alone nor in combination , suggesting that it involves multiple ( rather than a few ) molecular targets of reversine . Videomicroscopy-based cell fate profiling revealed that , in response to high-dose reversine , TP53 ( -/- ) ( but not TP53 ( +/+ ) ) cells undergo several consecutive rounds of abortive mitosis , resulting in the generation of hyperpolyploid cells that are prone to succumb to apoptosis upon the activation of mitotic catastrophe . In line with this notion , the depletion of anti-apoptotic proteins of the BCL-2 family sensitized TP53 ( -/- ) cells to the toxic effects of high-dose reversine . Moreover , the knockdown of BAX or APAF-1 , as well as the chemical inhibition of caspases , limited the death of TP53 ( -/- ) cells in response to high-dose reversine . Altogether , these results suggest that p53-deficient cells are particularly sensitive to the simultaneous inhibition of multiple kinases , including MPS1 , as it occurs in response to high-dose reversine .
High glycolysis , well known as " Warburg effect, " is frequently observed in a variety of cancers . Whether the deregulation of miRNAs contributes to the Warburg effect remains largely unknown . Because miRNA regulates gene expression at both mRNA and protein levels , we constructed a gene functional association network , which allows us to detect the gene activity instead of gene expression , to integratively analyze the microarray data for gene expression and miRNA expression profiling and identify glycolysis-related gene-miRNA pairs deregulated in cancer . Hexokinase 2 ( HK2 ) , coding for the first rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis , is among the top list of genes predicted and potentially regulated by multiple miRNAs including miR-143 . Interestingly , miR-143 expression was inversely associated with HK2 protein level but not mRNA level in human lung cancer samples. miR-143 , down-regulated by mammalian target of rapamycin activation , reduces glucose metabolism and inhibits cancer cell proliferation and tumor formation through targeting HK2 . Collectively , we have not only established a novel methodology for gene-miRNA pair prediction but also identified miR-143 as an essential regulator of cancer glycolysis via targeting HK2 .
PURPOSE Precise monitoring of active angiogenesis in neovascular eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) enables sensitive use of antiangiogenic drugs and reduces adverse side effects . So far , no in vivo imaging methods are available to specifically label active angiogenesis . Here , we report such a technique using fluorophore-labeled cationic liposomes ( CL ) detected with a standard clinical in vivo scanning laser ophthalmoscope ( SLO ) . METHODS C57Bl/6 mice underwent laser coagulations at day 0 ( d0 ) to induce choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) . Liposomes labeled with Oregon green , rhodamine ( Rh ) , or indocyanine green ( ICG ) were injected into the tail vein at various time points after laser coagulation , and their fluorescence was observed in vivo 60 min later using an SLO , or afterwards in choroidal flatmounts or cryosections . RESULTS SLO detected accumulated fluorescence only in active CNV lesions with insignificant background noise . The best signal was obtained with CL-ICG . Choroidal flatmounts and cryosections of the eye confirmed the location of retained CL in CNV lesions . Neutral liposomes , in contrast , showed no accumulation . CONCLUSIONS These results establish fluorophore-labeled CL as high affinity markers to selectively stain active CNV . This novel , non-invasive SLO imaging technique could improve risk assessment and indication for current intraocular antiangiogenic drugs in neovascular eye diseases , as well as monitor therapeutic outcomes . Labeling of angiogenic vessels using CL can be of interest not only for functional imaging in ophthalmology but also for other conditions where localization of active angiogenesis is desirable .
Recent advances allow multiplexed genome engineering in E. coli , employing easily designed oligonucleotides to edit multiple loci simultaneously . A similar technology in human cells would greatly expedite functional genomics , both by enhancing our ability to test how individual variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) are related to specific phenotypes , and potentially allowing simultaneous mutation of multiple loci . However , oligo-mediated targeting of human cells is currently limited by low targeting efficiencies and low survival of modified cells . Using a HeLa-based EGFP-rescue reporter system we show that use of modified base analogs can increase targeting efficiency , in part by avoiding the mismatch repair machinery . We investigate the effects of oligonucleotide toxicity and find a strong correlation between the number of phosphorothioate bonds and toxicity . Stably EGFP-corrected cells were generated at a frequency of with an optimized oligonucleotide design combining modified bases and reduced number of phosphorothioate bonds . We provide evidence from comparative RNA-seq analysis suggesting cellular immunity induced by the oligonucleotides might contribute to the low viability of oligo-corrected cells . Further optimization of this method should allow rapid and scalable genome engineering in human cells .
Breast cancer consists in a chronic inflammatory disease with multiple biological and clinical behaviors . Based on high throughput technologies data , this disease is currently classified according to the molecular expression of estrogen ( ER ) , progesterone ( PR ) and human epidermal growth factor ( HER-2 ) receptors . In this study , we defined the inflammatory profile of the main molecular subtypes of breast cancer patients : luminal ( ER and PR positive , HER-2 negative ) , HER-2 enriched ( HER-2 positive ) and triple negative ( ER , PR and HER-2 negative ) . Cytokines panel was assessed by measurement of TNF-alpha , TGF-beta , IL-1 , IL-10 and IL-12 plasmatic levels . Oxidative profile was assessed by determination of lipid peroxidation , total antioxidant capacity of plasma , malondialdehyde levels , carbonyl content and nitric oxide ( NO ) . Clinical data were correlated with inflammatory findings . Our findings demonstrated that patients bearing the luminal subtype displayed high TNF-alpha , TGF-beta and enhanced oxidative stress levels associated with reduced IL-12 . HER-2-enriched group exhibited higher levels of TNF-alpha , IL-12 and TGF-beta associated with enhanced oxidative stress . Triple-negative subtype exhibited the most aggressive profile of disease behavior , with reduction in both TNF-alpha and TGF-beta , with high levels of lipid peroxidation and NO . The clinical importance of our findings lies in the fact that the inflammatory status varies in distinct ways due to molecular subtype of breast cancer , opening potential therapeutic targets to future therapies .
The transcription factor MycN is the prototypical neuroblastoma oncogene and a potential therapeutic target . However , its strong expression caused by gene amplification in about 30% of neuroblastoma patients is a considerable obstacle to the development of therapeutic approaches aiming at eliminating its tumourigenic activity . We have previously reported that B-Myb is essentially required for transcription of the MYCN amplicon and have also shown that B-MYB and MYCN are engaged in a feed forward loop promoting the survival/proliferation of neuroblastoma cells . We postulated that pharmacological strategies breaking the B-MYB/MYCN axis should result in clinically desirable effects . Thus , we implemented a high throughput chemical screen , using a curated library of compounds from the National Cancer Institute , whose endpoint was the identification of small molecules that inhibited B-Myb . At the end of the screening , we found that the compounds pinafide , ellipticine and camptothecin inhibited B-Myb transcriptional activity in luciferase assays . One of the compounds , the topoisomerase-1 inhibitor camptothecin , is of considerable clinical interest since its derivatives topotecan and irinotecan are currently used as first and second line treatment agents for various types of cancer , including neuroblastoma . We found that neuroblastoma cells with amplification of MYCN are more sensitive than MYCN negative cells to camptothecin and topotecan killing . Campothecin and topotecan caused selective down-regulation of B-Myb and MycN expression in neuroblastoma cells . Notably , forced overexpression of B-Myb could antagonize the killing effect of topotecan and camptothecin , demonstrating that the transcription factor is a key target of the drugs . These results suggest that camptothecin and its analogues should be more effective in patients whose tumours feature amplification of MYCN and/or overexpression of B-MYB .
A simple reversed-phase HPLC method for measuring hepatic levels of acetaminophen- ( APAP- ) protein adduct following an overdose of APAP was developed . An aliquot of liver homogenate in phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 ( PBS ) was placed on a Nanosep centrifugal device , which was centrifuged to obtain a protein residue . This residue was incubated with a solution of p-aminobenzoic acid ( PABA ) , the internal standard , and bacterial protease in PBS , transferred to a Nanosep centrifugal device , and centrifuged . A 100\u2009\u03bcL portion of the filtrate was analyzed on a YMC-Pack ODS-AMQ C18 column , using 100\u2009mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate-methanol-acetic acid ( 100\u2009:\u20090.6\u2009:\u20090.1 ) as the mobile phase , a flow rate of 1\u2009mL/min , and photometric detection at 254\u2009nm . PABA and APAP-cystein-S-yl ( APAP-Cys ) eluted at and 22.7\u2009min , respectively . Method linearity , based on on-column concentrations of APAP-Cys , was observed over the range 0.078-40\u2009\u03bcg . Recoveries of APAP-Cys from spiked blank liver homogenates ranged from to 91% . Limits of detection and of quantification of APAP-Cys , based on column concentrations , were 0.06\u2009\u03bcg and 0.14\u2009\u03bcg , respectively . RSD values for interday and intraday analyses of a blank liver homogenate spiked with APAP-Cyst at three levels were , in all cases , \u22641.0% and <1.5% , respectively . The proposed method was found appropriate for comparing the antidotal properties of N-acetylcysteine and taurine in a rat model of APAP poisoning .
Targeting receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) degradation may be an interesting approach to reduce RTK cell signaling in cancer cells . Here we show that increasing E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B-lineage lymphoma ( c-Cbl ) expression using lentiviral infection decreased osteosarcoma cell replication and survival and reduced cell migration and invasion in murine and human osteosarcoma cells . Conversely , c-Cbl inhibition using short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) increased osteosarcoma cell growth and survival , as well as invasion and migration , indicating that c-Cbl plays a critical role as a bone tumor suppressor . Importantly , the anticancer effect of increasing c-Cbl expression in osteosarcoma cells was related mainly to the downregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRalpha ) . In a murine bone tumor model , increasing c-Cbl expression also reduced RTK expression , resulting in decreased tumor cell proliferation and survival and reduced tumor growth . Interestingly , increasing c-Cbl also markedly reduced lung metastasis in mice . Tissue microarray analysis revealed that low c-Cbl protein expression is associated with elevated EGFR and PDGFRalpha protein levels in human osteosarcoma with poor outcome . This study shows that increasing c-Cbl expression reduces osteosarcoma cell growth , survival , and metastasis in part through downregulation of RTKs , which supports the potential therapeutic interest of targeting c-Cbl in malignant bone diseases involving increased RTK .
Pyruvate constitutes a critical branch point in cellular carbon metabolism . We have identified two proteins , Mpc1 and Mpc2 , as essential for mitochondrial pyruvate transport in yeast , Drosophila , and humans . Mpc1 and Mpc2 associate to form an complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane . Yeast and Drosophila mutants lacking MPC1 display impaired pyruvate metabolism , with an accumulation of upstream metabolites and a depletion of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates . Loss of yeast Mpc1 results in defective mitochondrial pyruvate uptake , and silencing of MPC1 or MPC2 in mammalian cells impairs pyruvate oxidation . A point mutation in MPC1 provides resistance to a known inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier . Human genetic studies of three families with children suffering from lactic acidosis and hyperpyruvatemia revealed a causal locus that mapped to MPC1 , changing single amino acids that are conserved throughout eukaryotes . These data demonstrate that Mpc1 and Mpc2 form an essential part of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier .
Radiotherapy is commonly used for cancer treatment . However , it often results in side effects due to radiation damage in normal tissue , such as bone marrow ( BM ) failure . Adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPC ) reside in BM next to the endosteal bone surface , which is lined primarily by hematopoietic niche osteoblastic cells . Osteoblasts are relatively more radiation-resistant than HSPCs , but the mechanisms are not well understood . In the present study , we demonstrated that the stress response gene REDD1 ( regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1 ) was highly expressed in human osteoblast cell line ( hFOB ) cells after \u03b3 irradiation . Knockdown of REDD1 with siRNA resulted in a decrease in hFOB cell numbers , whereas transfection of PCMV6-AC-GFP-REDD1 plasmid DNA into hFOB cells inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) and p21 expression and protected these cells from radiation-induced premature senescence ( PS ) . The PS in irradiated hFOB cells were characterized by significant inhibition of clonogenicity , activation of senescence biomarker SA-\u03b2-gal , and the senescence-associated cytokine secretory phenotype ( SASP ) after 4 or 8 Gy irradiation . Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the stress response proteins p53 and nuclear factor \u03ba B ( NFkB ) interacted with REDD1 in hFOB cells . Knockdown of NFkB or p53 gene dramatically suppressed REDD1 protein expression in these cells , indicating that REDD1 was regulated by both factors . Our data demonstrated that REDD1 is a protective factor in radiation-induced osteoblast cell premature senescence .
OBJECTIVE Angiogenesis represents a key element in the pathogenesis of malignancy . There are no robust data on prognostic factors for overall survival ( OS ) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-targeted therapy . The present study was conducted to establish a prognostic model for patients using an oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer . METHODS Baseline characteristics and outcomes on 170 patients treated with FOLFIRI or XELOX plus anti-VEGF therapy-naive metastatic colorectal cancer were collected from three Turkey cancer centers . Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent prognostic factors for OS . RESULTS The median OS for the whole cohort was 19 months ( 95% CI , 14.3 to 23.6 months ) . Three of the seven adverse prognostic factors according to the Anatolian Society of Medical Oncology ( ASMO ) were independent predictors of short survival : serum lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) greater than the upper limit of normal ( ULN ; p<0.001 ) ; neutrophils greater than the ULN ( p<0.0014 ) ; and progression free survival ( PFS ) less than 6 months ( p =0.001 ) . CONCLUSION Serum LDH and neutrophil levels were the main prognostic factors in predicting survival , followed by PFS . This model validates incorporation of components of the ASMO model into patient care and clinical trials that use VEGF-targeting agents .
Profound disruptions of circadian rhythms and sleep/wake cycles constitute a major cause of institutionalization of AD patients . This study investigated whether a rodent model of AD , APP(NLH/NLH)/PS-1(P264L/264L) ( APPxPS1 ) mice , exhibits circadian alterations . The APPxPS1 mice were generated using CD-1/129 mice and Cre-lox knock-in technology to " humanize " the mouse amyloid ( A)\u03b2 sequence and create a presenilin-1 mutation identified in familial early-onset AD patients . APPxPS1 and WT mice of several ages ( 11 , and 15 months ) were monitored for circadian rhythms in wheel running , cage activity , and sleep:wake behavior . After rhythm assessment , the mice were euthanized at zeitgeber time ( ZT ) 2 or 10 ( i.e. , 2 or 10 h after lights-on ) and brains were dissected . Amyloid\u03b2 levels were measured in cortical samples and brain sections of the hypothalamus and hippocampus were prepared and used for in situ hybridization of circadian or neuropeptide genes . The most significant effects of the APPxPS1 transgenes were phase delays of h in the onset of daytime wakefulness bouts ( P<0.005 ) and peak wakefulness ( P<0.02 ) , potentially relevant to phase delays previously reported in AD patients . However , genotype did not affect the major activity peaks or phases of wheel running , wake , or general movement , which were bimodal with dominant dawn and dusk activity . Expression of Period 2 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus was affected by ZT ( P<0.0001 ) with a marginal interaction effect of age , genotype , and ZT ( P<0.08 ) . A separate analysis of the old animals indicated a robust interaction between ZT and genotype , as well as main effects of these parameters . Aging also altered sleep ( e.g. , bout length and amount of daytime sleep ) and the amount of wheel running and cage activity . In conclusion , the APPxPS1 knock-in mice exhibit some alterations in their sleep:wake rhythm and clock gene expression , but do not show robust , genotype-related changes in activity rhythms . The prominent daytime activity peaks shown by the background strain complicate the use of these APPxPS1 knock-in mice for investigations of circadian activity rhythms in AD . In addition to this unusual activity pattern , lack of hyperactivity differentiates the APPxPS1 knock-in mice from other transgenic AD models .
Cancer cells have elevated aerobic glycolysis that is termed the Warburg effect . But several tumor cells , including leukemic cells , also increase glutamine metabolism , which is initiated by glutaminase ( GLS ) . The microRNA ( miRNA ) miR-23 targets GLS mRNA and inhibits expression of GLS protein . Here we show that in human leukemic Jurkat cells the NF-kappaB p65 subunit binds to miR-23a promoter and inhibits miR-23a expression . Histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors release p65-induced inhibition . Jurkat cells growing in glutamine decrease proliferation due to cell accumulation in G0/G1 phase . Nevertheless , cells get used to this new source of energy by increasing GLS expression , which correlates with an increase in p65 expression and its translocation to the nucleus , leading to a higher basal NF-kappaB activity . Jurkat cells overexpressing p65 show increase basal GLS expression and proliferate faster than control cells in glutamine medium . Overexpressing miR-23a in leukemic cells impaired glutamine use and induces mitochondrial dysfunction leading to cell death . Therefore , p65 activation decreases miR-23a expression , which facilitates glutamine consumption allowing leukemic cells to use this alternative source of carbon and favoring their adaptation to the metabolic environment .
BACKGROUND The c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase is aberrantly activated in many solid tumors . In a prior study we showed that prostate cancer PC-3 cells exhibit constitutively activated c-Met without exogenous hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) ; however whether this characteristic is due to an endogenous HGF/c-Met autocrine loop remains controversial . In the current study we examined the response of PC-3 cells to an anti-HGF neutralizing antibody or a small molecule Met kinase inhibitor ( BMS-777607 ) . METHODS Cell scattering was tested by monitoring cell morphology after HGF stimulation . Cell migration was examined by both " wound-healing " and transwell assasy and invasion was detected by Matrigel-coated transwell assay . Proliferation , survival and anoikis were determined by MTT , colony formation and trypan blue exclusion assay , respectively . Gene and protein expression were assessed by real-time PCR and Western blot , respectively . RESULTS Although HGF mRNA could be detected in PC-3 cells , the molecular weight of secreted " HGF " protein was inconsistent with the functional recombinant HGF . Furthermore , conditioned medium from PC-3 cell cultures was ineffective at triggering either motogenic behavior or c-Met signaling in DU145 , another prostate cancer cell line expressing c-Met but lacking basal c-Met activation . PC-3 cells also were not responsive to the anti-HGF neutralizing antibody in experiments assessing proliferation , migration , or c-Met signaling . BMS-777607 treatment with micromolar doses nonetheless led to significant inhibition of multiple PC-3 cell functions including proliferation , clonogenicity , migration and invasion . At the molecular level , BMS-777607 suppressed autophosphorylated c-Met and downstream c-Src and Akt pathways . CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the constitutive c-Met activation in PC-3 is independent of autocrine stimulation . Because PC-3 cells were responsive to BMS-777607 but not the anti-HGF antibody , the findings also indicate that under circumstances where c-Met is constitutively hyperactive in the absence of functional HGF , targeting the c-Met receptor remains a viable therapeutic option to impede cancer progression .
Heart failure and arrhythmias occur at 3 to 5 times higher rates among individuals with diabetes mellitus , compared with age-matched , healthy individuals . Studies attribute these defects in part to alterations in the function of cardiac type 2 ryanodine receptors ( RyR2s ) , the principal Ca(2+)-release channels on the internal sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) . To date , mechanisms underlying RyR2 dysregulation in diabetes remain poorly defined . A rat model of type 1 diabetes , in combination with echocardiography , in vivo and ex vivo hemodynamic studies , confocal microscopy , Western blotting , mass spectrometry , site-directed mutagenesis , and [ (3)H]ryanodine binding , lipid bilayer , and transfection assays , was used to determine whether post-translational modification by reactive carbonyl species ( RCS ) represented a contributing cause . After 8 weeks of diabetes , spontaneous Ca(2+) release in ventricular myocytes increased Evoked Ca(2+) release from the SR was nonuniform ( dyssynchronous ) . Total RyR2 protein levels remained unchanged , but the ability to bind the Ca(2+)-dependent ligand [ (3)H]ryanodine was significantly reduced . Western blotting and mass spectrometry revealed RCS adducts on select basic residues . Mutation of residues to delineate the physiochemical impact of carbonylation yielded channels with enhanced or reduced cytoplasmic Ca(2+) responsiveness . The prototype RCS methylglyoxal increased and then decreased the RyR2 open probability . Methylglyoxal also increased spontaneous Ca(2+) release and induced Ca(2+) waves in healthy myocytes . Treatment of diabetic rats with RCS scavengers normalized spontaneous and evoked Ca(2+) release from the SR , reduced carbonylation of RyR2s , and increased binding of [ (3)H]ryanodine to RyR2s . From these data , we conclude that post-translational modification by RCS contributes to the heterogeneity in RyR2 activity that is seen in experimental diabetes .
Most ovarian cancers are estrogen-positive and hormonal treatments using anti-estrogens or aromatase inhibitors are under investigation for treating the tumors that are resistant to conventional therapies . In this study , the long-term effects of two anti-estrogens , namely 4-hydroxytamoxifen and fulvestrant ( or ICI182,780 ) , were investigated in ERalpha-positive BG1 epithelial ovarian cancer cells . To this aim , cells were grown in the presence of anti-estrogen concentrations that were sufficient to saturate the estrogen receptors , but were neither cytotoxic nor cytostatic as indicated by the absence of inhibition of cell proliferation . In these conditions and despite the lack of cytostatic effect of the drugs , long-term treatment ( 3 months ) with the pure anti-estrogen fulvestrant induced a specific , reproducible and irreversible inhibition of ERalpha expression . This inhibition was accompanied by loss of estrogen-induced cell proliferation and gene expression as indicated by the analysis of several estrogen-responsive genes . ERalpha down-regulation was not linked to deregulated expression of transcription factors which drive ERalpha transcription and did not involve DNA methylation or histone deacetylation . Altogether , these results demonstrate that non-cytotoxic concentrations of pure anti-estrogens affect estrogen signaling and might be relevant for the treatment for ovarian cancers .
We previously reported that hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) activated by angiotensin II ( AngII ) facilitate stromal fibrosis and tumor progression in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC ) . AngII has been known as a growth factor which can promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) in renal epithelial cells , alveolar epithelial cells and peritoneal mesothelial cells . However , in the past , the relationship between AngII and stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( SDF-1 ) in the microenvironment around cancer and the role of AngII on EMT of cancer cells has not been reported in detail . SDF-1 and its specific receptor , CXCR4 , are now receiving attention as a mechanism of cell progression and metastasis . In this study , we examined whether activated HSCs promote tumor fibrogenesis , tumor progression and distant metastasis by mediating EMT via the AngII/AngII type 1 receptor ( AT-1 ) and the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis . Two human ICC cell lines and a human HSC line , LI-90 , express CXCR4 . Significantly higher concentration of SDF-1alpha was released into the supernatant of LI-90 cells to which AngII had been added . SDF-1alpha increased the proliferative activity of HSCs and enhanced the activation of HSCs as a growth factor . Furthermore , addition of SDF-1alpha and AngII enhanced the increase of the migratory capability and vimentin expression , reduced E-cadherin expression , and translocated the expression of beta-catenin into the nucleus and cytoplasm in ICC cells . Co-culture with HSCs also enhanced the migratory capability of ICC cells . These findings suggest that SDF-1alpha , released from activated HSCs and AngII , play important roles in cancer progression , tumor fibrogenesis , and migration in autocrine and paracrine fashion by mediating EMT . Our mechanistic findings may provide pivotal insights into the molecular mechanism of the AngII and SDF-1alpha-initiated signaling pathway that regulates fibrogenesis in cancerous stroma , tumor progression and meta-stasis of tumor cells expressing AT-1 and CXCR4 .
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality underscoring the need for safe and effective chemopreventive strategies . Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is attractive in that it is an early critical event in HNSCC pathogenesis . However , current agents lack efficacy or have unacceptable toxicity . Several groups have demonstrated that the over-the-counter medication , polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) has remarkable chemopreventive efficacy against colon carcinogenesis . Importantly , we reported that this effect is mediated through EGFR internalization/degradation . In the current study , we investigated the chemopreventive efficacy of this agent against HNSCC , using both the well validated animal model 4-NQO ( 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide ) rat model and cell culture with the human HNSCC cell line SCC-25 . We demonstrated that daily topical application of 10% PEG-8000 in the oral cavity ( tongue and cavity wall ) post 4NQO initiation resulted in a significant reduction in tumor burden ( both , tumor size and tumors/tumor bearing rat ) without any evidence of toxicity . Immunohistochemical studies depicted decreased proliferation ( number of Ki67-positive cells ) and reduced expression of EGFR and its downstream effectors cyclin D1 in the tongue mucosa of 4NQO-rats treated with PEG . We showed that EGFR was also markedly downregulated in SCC-25 cells by PEG-8000 with a concomitant induction of G1-S phase cell-cycle arrest , which was potentially mediated through upregulated p21(cip1/waf1) . In conclusion , we demonstrate , for the first time , that PEG has promising efficacy and safety as a chemopreventive efficacy against oral carcinogenesis .
MDC1 ( NFBD1 ) and 53BP1 are critical mediators of the mammalian DNA damage response ( DDR ) at nuclear foci . Here we show by quantitative imaging assays that MDC1 and 53BP1 are similar in total copy number ( copies per focus ) , but differ substantially in dynamics at both replication-associated nuclear bodies in normal cells and DNA repair foci in ionizing radiation ( IR)-damaged cells . The majority of MDC1 ( is extremely mobile and under continuous exchange , with only a small fraction ( remaining immobile at foci irrespective of IR treatment . By contrast , 53BP1 has a smaller mobile fraction ( and a larger immobile fraction ( at nuclear bodies , and becomes more dynamic ( increase in mobile pool ) upon IR-induced DNA damage . More specifically , the dynamics of 53BP1 is dependent on a minimal foci-targeting region ( 1231-1709 ) , and differentially regulated by its N-terminus ( 1-1231 ) and C-terminal tBRCT domain ( 1709-1972 ) . Furthermore , MDC1 knockdown , or disruption of 53BP1-MDC1 interaction , reduced the number of 53BP1 molecules at foci by but only modestly affected 53BP1 retention . This novel in vivo evidence reveals distinct dynamics of MDC1 and 53BP1 at different types of nuclear structures , and shows that MDC1 directly recruits and retains a subset of 53BP1 for DNA repair .
In Salmonella enterica , the protein acetyltransferase ( Pat ) enzyme is part of the sirtuin-dependent acylation/deacylation system ( SDPADS ) that modulates the activity of several proteins via the acylation of lysine residues critical to their activities . Pat is a kDa protein with two distinct domains , an N-terminal acyl-CoA synthetase ( NDP-forming ) domain ( aa ) and a C-terminal acetyltransferase domain ( aa ) , with homology to proteins of the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase ( GNAT ) superfamily . Although the role of the GNAT-like domain is likely responsible for the catalytic activity of Pat , the role of the N-terminal domain remains unclear . Here we report the use of positive selection for identification of residues critical for Pat enzyme activity . This approach revealed seven residues that , when changed , resulted in drastic loss of Pat activity in vitro which caused a discernable loss-of-function phenotype . Five of the seven residues were located in the N-terminal region of Pat and two were located in the GNAT-like domain . Each single-amino-acid variant had a circular dichroism spectrum that differed from that of the wild-type Pat protein , suggesting that loss of enzymatic activity in the mutant proteins was likely due to an inability to acquire its biologically active fold .
Despite recent population data , the influence of dietary folate supplementation on colon cancer risk remains controversial . This study examines the effects of folate deficiency , in combination with choline , methionine , and vitamin B12 depletion , on intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice . Methyl donor sufficient ( MDS ) and deficient ( MDD ) diets were started at five or 10 weeks of age and tumors evaluated at 16 weeks . MDD suppressed intestinal tumor formation in Apc(Min/+) mice ( when started at five weeks of age . The protective effect was lost when MDD was initiated at 10 weeks of age , indicating an important time dependency on cancer suppression . Concomitant with cancer protection , MDD restricted body weight gain . Therefore , a second study was conducted in which MDS was given ad libitum or pair-fed with MDD . Although small intestinal tumors were reduced 54% in pair-fed MDS mice , MDD caused a further reduction ( 96% ) . In colon , although MDD did not affect tumor numbers , tumor size was reduced . Gene expression profiling of normal-appearing colonic mucosa after 11 weeks on MDD identified a total of 493 significantly downregulated genes relative to the MDS group . Pathway analysis placed many of these genes within general categories of inflammatory signaling and cell-cycle regulation , consistent with recently published human data obtained during folate depletion . Further studies are warranted to investigate the complex interplay of methyl donor status and cancer protection in high-risk populations .
Adults and children with high-risk CRLF2-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) respond poorly to current cytotoxic chemotherapy and suffer unacceptably high rates of relapse , supporting the need to use alternative therapies . CRLF2 encodes the thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP ) receptor , which activates cell signaling in normal lymphocytes on binding its ligand , TSLP . We hypothesized that aberrant cell signaling occurs in CRLF2-rearranged ALL and can be targeted by signal transduction inhibitors of this pathway . In a large number of primary CRLF2-rearranged ALL samples , we observed increased basal levels of pJAK2 , pSTAT5 , and pS6 . We thus characterized the biochemical sequelae of CRLF2 and JAK alterations in CRLF2-rearranged ALL primary patient samples via analysis of TSLP-mediated signal transduction . TSLP stimulation of these leukemias further induced robust JAK/STAT and PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling . JAK inhibition abrogated phosphorylation of JAK/STAT and , surprisingly , of PI3K/mTOR pathway members , suggesting an interconnection between these signaling networks and providing a rationale for testing JAK inhibitors in clinical trials . The PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors rapamycin , PI103 , and PP242 also inhibited activated signal transduction and translational machinery proteins of the PI3K/mTOR pathway , suggesting that signal transduction inhibitors targeting this pathway also may have therapeutic relevance for patients with CRLF2-rearranged ALL and merit further preclinical testing .
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is used for treatment of lymphoma . In an attempt to design an efficacious and safe prehematopoietic stem cell transplantation conditioning regimen , we investigated the cytotoxicity of the combination of busulfan ( B ) , melphalan ( M ) , and gemcitabine ( G ) in lymphoma cell lines in the absence or presence of drugs that induce epigenetic changes . Cells were exposed to drugs individually or in combination and analyzed by the MTT proliferation assay , flow cytometry , and Western blotting . We used drug concentrations ( 57 muM B , 1 muM M and 0.02 muM G ) , which individually did not have major effects on cell proliferation . Their combination resulted in 50% inhibition of proliferation . Reduction to almost half concentration ( 20 muM B , 0.7 muM M and 0.01 muM G ) did not have significant effects , but addition of the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( 0.6 muM ) to this combination resulted in a marked ( growth inhibition . The cytotoxicity of these combinations correlates with the activation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated-CHK2 pathway , phosphorylation of KRAB-associated protein-1 , epigenetic changes such as methylation and acetylation of histone 3 , and activation of apoptosis . The relevance of epigenetic changes is further shown by the induction of DNA methyltransferases in tumor cells with low constitutive levels of DNMT3A and DNMT3B . The addition of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine to ( BMG+suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ) further enhances cell killing . Overall , BMG combinations are synergistically cytotoxic to lymphoma cells . Epigenetic changes induced by suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine further enhance the cytotoxicity . This study provides a rationale for an ongoing clinical trial in our institution using ( BMG+suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ) as pre-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation conditioning for lymphoma .
To determine the threshold dose of beta-Naphthoflavone ( BNF ) that induces hepatocellular tumor promoting effects , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance ( TBARS ) formation , and drug-metabolizing enzymes that protect against ROS generation , two-stage liver carcinogenesis model was used . Partial hepatectomized rats ( n = 11 to 12 ) were fed diets containing 0 , 0.03 , 0.06 , 0.125 or 0.25% BNF for 6 weeks after an intraperitoneal injection of N-diethylnitrosamine ( DEN ) to initiate hepatocarcinogenesis . Histopathologically , glutathione S-transferase placental form ( GST-P)-positive foci significantly increased in rats given 0.25% BNF . No marked changes in ROS production and TBARS contents were observed between the BNF treated and DEN alone groups . Real-time RT-PCR showed that the expression of Cyp1a1 , Cyp1a2 , Cyp1b1 and Nqo1 significantly increased in the groups given 0.03% BNF or more , but Ugt1a6 , Akr7a3 and Gstm1 significantly increased in the groups given 0.125% BNF or more . Gpx2 and Yc2 significantly increased in the groups given 0.06% BNF or more and 0.25% BNF , respectively . Inflammation-related genes such as Ccl2 , Mmp12 , Serpine1 and Cox-2 significantly increased in the 0.25% BNF group . In immunohistochemistry , the number of cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2)-positive cells increased in rats given 0.25% BNF . These results suggest that 0.25% BNF is the threshold dose for liver tumor promotion , and the fact that inflammation-related genes and COX-2 protein increased in the 0.25% BNF group strongly suggests that inflammation is involved in the liver tumor promoting effect of BNF in rats .
Airway mucin secretion and MC ( mast cell ) degranulation must be tightly controlled for homoeostasis of the lungs and immune system respectively . We found the exocytic protein Munc18b to be highly expressed in mouse airway epithelial cells and MCs , and localized to the apical pole of airway secretory cells . To address its functions , we created a mouse with a severely hypomorphic Munc18b allele such that protein expression in heterozygotes was reduced by Homozygous mutant mice were not viable , but heterozygotes showed a reduction in stimulated release of mucin from epithelial cells and granule contents from MCs . The defect in MCs affected only regulated secretion and not constitutive or transporter-mediated secretion . The severity of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis was also reduced by showing that reduction of Munc18b expression results in an attenuation of physiological responses dependent on MC degranulation . The Munc18b promoter is controlled by INR ( initiator ) , Sp1 ( specificity protein 1 ) , Ets , CRE ( cAMP-response element ) , GRE ( glucocorticoid-response element ) , GATA and E-box elements in airway epithelial cells ; however , protein levels did not change during mucous metaplasia induced by allergic inflammation . Taken together , the results of the present study identify Munc18b as an essential gene that is a limiting component of the exocytic machinery of epithelial cells and MCs .
DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells are repaired primarily by homologous recombination ( HR ) . The mechanism by which HR is regulated in these cells , however , remains enigmatic . To gain insight into such regulatory mechanisms , we have asked how protein levels of Rad51 , a key component of HR , are controlled in mouse ES cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts ( MEFs ) . The Rad51 protein level is about 15-fold higher in ES cells than in MEFs . The level of Rad51 mRNA , however , is only higher , indicating that the differences in mRNA levels due to rates of transcription or mRNA stability are not sufficient to account for the large difference in the abundance of Rad51 protein . Comparison of Rad51 half-lives between ES cells and MEFs also did not explain the elevated level of Rad51 protein in the ES cells . A comparative assessment of the Rad51 translation level demonstrated that it is translated with much greater efficacy in ES cells than in MEFs . To determine whether this high level of translation in ES cells is a general phenomenon in these cells or whether it is a characteristic of specific proteins , such as those involved with recombination and cell cycle progression , we compared mechanisms that regulate the level of Pcna in ES cells with those that regulate Rad51 . The half-life of Pcna and its rate of synthesis were considerably different from those of Rad51 in ES cells , demonstrating that regulation of Rad51 abundance cannot be generalized to other ES cell proteins and not to proteins involved in DNA replication and cell cycle control . Finally , we show that only a small proportion of the abundant Rad51 protein population is activated under basal conditions in ES cells and recruited to DNA DSBs and/or stalled replication forks .
OBJECTIVE Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is a highly vascularized tumor in which neoangiogenesis contributes to growth and metastasis . We assessed the safety , efficacy , and potential biomarkers of activity of bevacizumab in patients with advanced HCC . METHODS In this phase II trial , eligible patients received bevacizumab , 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks . The disease-control rate at 16 weeks ( 16W-DCR ) was the primary endpoint . Circulating endothelial cells ( CECs ) and plasma cytokines and angiogenic factors ( CAFs ) were measured at baseline and throughout treatment . RESULTS The 16W-DCR was 42% ( 95% confidence interval , 27%-57% ) . Six of the 43 patients who received bevacizumab achieved a partial response ( objective response rate [ ORR ] , 14% ) . Grade 3-4 asthenia , hemorrhage , and aminotransferase elevation occurred in five ( 12% ) , three ( 7% ) , and three ( 7% ) patients , respectively . During treatment , placental growth factor markedly increased , whereas vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A dramatically decreased ( p < .0001 ) ; soluble VEGF receptor-2 ( p < .0001 ) and CECs ( p = .03 ) transiently increased on day 3 . High and increased CEC counts at day 15 were associated with the ORR ( p = .04 ) and the 16W-DCR ( p = .02 ) , respectively . Lower interleukin ( IL)-8 levels at baseline ( p = .01 ) and throughout treatment ( p <= .04 ) were associated with the 16W-DCR . High baseline IL-8 and IL-6 levels predicted shorter progression-free and overall survival times ( p <= .04 ) . CONCLUSION Bevacizumab is active and well tolerated in patients with advanced HCC . The clinical value of CECs , IL-6 , and IL-8 warrants further investigation .
In previous work , three suppressors of defective group I introns ( 7151 , 71N1 , 7120 ) were isolated from a mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that had a splicing-deficient chloroplast large subunit ( LSU ) rRNA intron . Genetic analysis indicated that the 7151 and 71N1 suppressor mutations each involved single nuclear loci , and that the 7151 mutation was dominant . Here we present genetic evidence that the 7120 suppressor also involves a single nuclear locus and that the mutation is dominant in vegetative diploids . Moreover , we have employed crosses with the S1D2 strain and molecular markers to map the 7120 and 71N1 suppressors . Based on an analysis of 800 progeny from 7120 x S1D2 , the 7120 suppressor is located in a region of kb on chromosome III that is devoid of recombination . The region contains at least 72 genes , about one-third of which ( i.e. , 22 ) are predicted to be organelle targeted . Similar analysis of 71N1 x S1D2 using 400 progeny also pointed to the recombination-deficient region of chromosome III , raising the possibility that these mutations could affect the same gene . These efforts lay the foundation for identifying the css ( chloroplast splicing suppressor ) gene(s) , which promotes splicing of multiple chloroplast group I introns .
Proliferating cells consume more glucose to cope with the bioenergetics and biosynthetic demands of rapidly dividing cells as well as to counter a shift in cellular redox environment . This study investigates the hypothesis that manganese superoxide dismutase ( MnSOD ) regulates cellular redox flux and glucose consumption during the cell cycle . A direct correlation was observed between glucose consumption and percentage of S-phase cells in MnSOD wild-type fibroblasts , which was absent in MnSOD homozygous knockout fibroblasts . Results from electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and flow cytometric assays showed a significant increase in cellular superoxide levels in S-phase cells , which was associated with an increase in glucose and oxygen consumption , and a decrease in MnSOD activity . Mass spectrometry results showed a complex pattern of MnSOD-methylation at both lysine ( 68 , 89 , 122 , and 202 ) and arginine ( 197 and 216 ) residues . MnSOD protein carrying a K89A mutation had significantly lower activity compared with wild-type MnSOD . Computational-based simulations indicate that lysine and arginine methylation of MnSOD during quiescence would allow greater accessibility to the enzyme active site as well as increase the positive electrostatic potential around and within the active site . Methylation-dependent changes in the MnSOD conformation and subsequent changes in the electrostatic potential around the active site during quiescence versus proliferation could increase the accessibility of superoxide , a negatively charged substrate . These results support the hypothesis that MnSOD regulates a " metabolic switch " during progression from quiescent through the proliferative cycle . We propose MnSOD as a new molecular player contributing to the Warburg effect .
To elucidate the function of MAS-related GPCR , member D ( MRGD ) in cancers , we investigated the in vitro and in vivo oncogenic function of MRGD using murine fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 in which MRGD is stably expressed . The expression pattern of MRGD in clinical samples was also analyzed . We found that overexpression of MRGD in NIH3T3 induced focus formation and multi-cellular spheroid formation , and promoted tumors in nude mice . In other words , overexpression of MRGD in NIH3T3 induced the loss of contact inhibition , anchorage-independent growth and in vivo tumorigenesis . Furthermore , it was found that the ligand of MRGD , beta-alanine , enhanced spheroid formation in MRGD-expressing NIH3T3 cells . From investigation of clinical cancer tissues , we found high expression of MRGD in several lung cancers by immunohistochemistry as well as real time PCR . Based on these results , MRGD could be involved in tumorigenesis and could also be a novel anticancer drug target .
CrtJ from Rhodobacter capsulatus is a regulator of genes involved in the biosynthesis of haem , bacteriochlorophyll , carotenoids as well as structural proteins of the light harvesting-II complex . Fluorescence anisotropy-based DNA-binding analysis demonstrates that oxidized CrtJ exhibits increase in binding affinity over that of reduced CrtJ . Liquid chromatography electrospray tandem ionization mass spectrometric analysis using DAz-2 , a sulfenic acid ( -SOH)-specific probe , demonstrates that exposure of CrtJ to oxygen or to hydrogen peroxide leads to significant accumulation of a sulfenic acid derivative of Cys420 which is located in the helix-turn-helix ( HTH ) motif . In vivo labelling with 4-(3-azidopropyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione ( DAz-2 ) shows that Cys420 also forms a sulfenic acid modification in vivo when cells are exposed to oxygen . Moreover , a Cys420 to Ala mutation leads to a reduction of DNA binding activity while a Cys to Ser substitution at position 420 that mimics a cysteine sulfenic acid results in a increase in DNA binding activity . These results provide the first example where sulfenic acid oxidation of a cysteine in a HTH-motif leads to differential effects on gene expression .
Contact inhibition of locomotion ( CIL ) is the process by which cells stop the continual migration in the same direction after collision with another cell . Highly invasive malignant cells exhibit diminished CIL when they contact stromal cells , which allows invasion of the tissue by tumors . We show that Nm23-H1 is essential for the suppression of Rac1 through inactivation of Tiam1 at the sites of cell-cell contact , which plays a pivotal role in CIL . U87MG cells show CIL when they contact normal glia . In spheroid confrontation assays U87MG cells showed only limited invasion of the glial population , but reduction of Nm23-H1 expression in U87MG cells abrogated CIL resulting in invasion . In U87MG cells , Nm23-H1 is translocated to the sites of contact with glia through association with \u03b1-catenin and N-cadherin . Mutants of Nm23-H1 , which lacked the binding ability with Tiam1 , or \u03b1-catenin did not restore CIL . Moreover , the expression of ephrin-B1 in tumor cells disrupted CIL and promoted invasion . As one mechanism , ephrin-B1 inhibits the association of Nm23-H1 with Tiam1 , which contributes for activation of Rac1 . These results indicate a novel function of Nm23-H1 to control CIL , and its negative regulation by ephrin-B1 .
BACKGROUND Metastatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the kidney is a rare malignant vascular tumor with a wide spectrum of behaviors . CASE REPORT We present the case of a 53-year-old male patient with tumor metastases which developed after radical nephrectomy . We describe the immunohistochemistry profile of the tumor and the successful long-term results of treatment with sunitinib , a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Also , we discuss the rationale for using this type of medication based on immunohistochemistry results . CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge , this is the first reported case of metastatic renal epithelioid hemangioendothelioma treated successfully with sunitinib .
Sirtuin proteins regulate diverse cellular pathways that influence genomic stability , metabolism and ageing . SIRT7 is a mammalian sirtuin whose biochemical activity , molecular targets and physiological functions have been unclear . Here we show that SIRT7 is an NAD(+)-dependent H3K18Ac ( acetylated lysine 18 of histone H3 ) deacetylase that stabilizes the transformed state of cancer cells . Genome-wide binding studies reveal that SIRT7 binds to promoters of a specific set of gene targets , where it deacetylates H3K18Ac and promotes transcriptional repression . The spectrum of SIRT7 target genes is defined in part by its interaction with the cancer-associated E26 transformed specific ( ETS ) transcription factor ELK4 , and comprises numerous genes with links to tumour suppression . Notably , selective hypoacetylation of H3K18Ac has been linked to oncogenic transformation , and in patients is associated with aggressive tumour phenotypes and poor prognosis . We find that deacetylation of H3K18Ac by SIRT7 is necessary for maintaining essential features of human cancer cells , including anchorage-independent growth and escape from contact inhibition . Moreover , SIRT7 is necessary for a global hypoacetylation of H3K18Ac associated with cellular transformation by the viral oncoprotein E1A . Finally , SIRT7 depletion markedly reduces the tumorigenicity of human cancer cell xenografts in mice . Together , our work establishes SIRT7 as a highly selective H3K18Ac deacetylase and demonstrates a pivotal role for SIRT7 in chromatin regulation , cellular transformation programs and tumour formation in vivo .
In the central nervous system , levels of extraneuronal dopamine are controlled primarily by the action of the dopamine transporter ( DAT ) . Multiple signaling pathways regulate transport activity , substrate efflux , and other DAT functions through currently unknown mechanisms . DAT is phosphorylated by protein kinase C within a serine cluster at the distal end of the cytoplasmic N terminus , whereas recent work in model cells revealed proline-directed phosphorylation of rat DAT at membrane-proximal residue Thr(53) . In this report , we use mass spectrometry and a newly developed phospho-specific antibody to positively identify DAT phosphorylation at Thr(53) in rodent striatal tissue and heterologous expression systems . Basal phosphorylation of Thr(53) occurred with a stoichiometry of and was strongly increased by phorbol esters and protein phosphatase inhibitors , demonstrating modulation of the site by signaling pathways that impact DAT activity . Mutations of Thr(53) to prevent phosphorylation led to reduced dopamine transport V(max) and total apparent loss of amphetamine-stimulated substrate efflux , supporting a major role for this residue in the transport kinetic mechanism .
OBJECTIVE Increases in plasma angiotensinogen ( Ang-N ) due to genetic polymorphisms or pharmacological stimuli like estrogen have been associated with a blood pressure ( BP ) rise , increased salt sensitivity and cardiovascular risk . The relationship between Ang-N , the resetting of the renin-angiotensin system , and BP still remains unclear . Angiotensin ( Ang ) II-induced genetic hypertension should respond to lisinopril treatment . METHODS A new transgenic rat line ( TGR ) with hepatic overexpression of native ( rat ) Ang-N was established to study high plasma Ang-N . The transgene contained a mutation producing Val(5)-Ang-II , which was measured separately from nontransgenic Ile-Ang-II in plasma and renal tissue . RESULTS Male homozygous TGR had increased plasma Ang-N ( systolic BP ( \u0394BP+26 mmHg ) , renin activity ( renin activity/concentration ( 5-fold ) , total Ang-II ( kidney 1.7-fold ) but decreased plasma renin concentrations ( -46% , kidney -85% ) and Ile(5)-Ang-I and II ( -93% , -94% ) vs. controls . Heterozygous TGR exhibited higher plasma Ang-N and 17 mmHg \u0394BP . Lisinopril decreased their SBP ( -23 vs. -13 mmHg in controls ) , kidney Ang-II/I ( vs. and Ile(5)-Ang-II ( -70 vs. -40% ) , and increased kidney renin and Ile(5)-Ang-I ( >2.5-fold vs. <2.5-fold ) . Kidney Ang-II remained higher and renin lower in TGR compared with controls . CONCLUSION High plasma Ang-N increases plasma and kidney Ang-II levels , and amplifies the plasma and renal Ang-II response to a given change in renal renin secretion . This enzyme-kinetic amplification dominates over the Ang-II mediated feedback reduction of renin secretion . High Ang-N levels thus facilitate hypertension via small increases of Ang II and may influence the effectiveness of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors .
Elevated phosphorylation of estrogen receptor alpha ( ERalpha ) at serines 118 ( S118 ) and 167 ( S167 ) is associated with favorable outcome for tamoxifen adjuvant therapy and may serve as surrogate markers for a functional ERalpha signaling pathway in breast cancer . It is possible that loss of phosphorylation at S118 and/or S167 could disrupt ERalpha signaling , resulting in aggressive ERalpha-independent breast cancer cells . To this end , MCF-7 breast cancer cells were stably transfected with an ERalpha-specific short hairpin RNA that reduced endogenous ERalpha . The resulting cell line was stably transfected with wild-type ERalpha ( ER-AB cells ) , or ERalpha containing serine to alanine mutation at S118 or S167 ( S118A cells and S167A cells , respectively ) . These stable cell lines expressed approximately equivalent ERalpha compared with parental MCF-7 cells and were evaluated for growth , morphology , migration/invasion , and ERalpha-regulated gene expression . S118A cells and S167A cells exhibited increased growth and migration/invasion in vitro . Forward- and side-scatter flow cytometry revealed that S167A cells were smaller in size , and both S118A and S167A cells exhibited less cellular complexity . S118A and S167A cells expressed pancytokeratin and membrane localization of beta-catenin and did not express vimentin , indicating retention of epithelial lineage markers . Expression of ERalpha-target genes and other genes regulated by ERalpha signaling or involved in breast cancer were markedly altered in both S118A and S167A cells . In summary , attenuated phosphorylation of ERalpha at S118 and S167 significantly affected cellular physiology and behavior in MCF-7 breast cancer cells , resulting in increased growth , migration/invasion , compromised expression of ERalpha target genes , and markedly altered gene expression patterns .
The protein nanopore Mycobacteria smegmatis porin A ( MspA ) , can be used to sense individual nucleotides within DNA , potentially enabling a technique known as nanopore sequencing . In this technique , single-stranded DNA electrophoretically moves through the nanopore and results in an ionic current that is nucleotide-specific . However , with a high transport velocity of the DNA within the nanopore , the ionic current cannot be used to distinguish signals within noise . Through extensive ( \u03bcs in total ) all-atom molecular dynamics simulations , we examine the effect of positively charged residues on DNA translocation rate and the ionic current blockades in MspA . Simulation of several arginine mutations show a fold reduction of DNA translocation speed without eliminating the nucleotide induced current blockages . Comparison of our results with similar engineering efforts on a different nanopore ( \u03b1-hemolysin ) reveals a nontrivial effect of nanopore geometry on the ionic current blockades in mutant nanopores .
BACKGROUND The 235delC mutation of GJB2 gene is considered as a risk factor for the non-syndromic hearing loss ( NSHL ) , and a significant difference in the frequency and distribution of the 235delC mutation has been described world widely . METHODS A systematic review was performed by means of a meta-analysis to evaluate the influence of the 235delC mutation on the risk of NSHL . A literature search in electronic databases using keywords " 235delC " , " GJB2 " associated with " carrier frequency " was conducted to include all papers from January 1999 to June 2011 . A total of 36 papers were included and there contained 13217 cases and 6521 controls derived from Oceania , American , Europe and Asian . RESULTS A remarkable heterogeneity between these studies was observed . The combined results of meta-analysis showed that the 235delC mutant increased the risk of NSHL ( OR = 7.9 , 95%CI 4.77 13.11 , P <0.00001 ) . Meanwhile , heterogeneity of genetic effect was also observed due to the ethnic specificity and regional disparity . Therefore , the stratified meta-analysis was subsequently conducted and the results indicated that the 235delC mutation was significantly correlated with the risk of NHSL in the East Asian and South-east Asian populations ( OR = 12.05 , 95%CI 8.33 P <0.00001 ) , but not significantly in the Oceania and European populations ( OR = 10.36 , 95%CI : 4.68 Z = 1.68 , P >0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS The 235delC mutation of GJB2 gene increased the risk of NHSL in the East Asian and South-east Asian populations , but non-significantly associated with the NSHL susceptibility in Oceania and European populations , suggesting a significant ethnic specificity of this NSHL-associated mutation .
BACKGROUND Detection of disease-causing mutations using Deep Sequencing technologies possesses great challenges . In particular , organizing the great amount of sequences generated so that mutations , which might possibly be biologically relevant , are easily identified is a difficult task . Yet , for this assignment only limited automatic accessible tools exist . FINDINGS We developed GenomeGems to gap this need by enabling the user to view and compare Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( SNPs ) from multiple datasets and to load the data onto the UCSC Genome Browser for an expanded and familiar visualization . As such , via automatic , clear and accessible presentation of processed Deep Sequencing data , our tool aims to facilitate ranking of genomic SNP calling . GenomeGems runs on a local Personal Computer ( PC ) and is freely available at http://www.tau.ac.il/ CONCLUSIONS GenomeGems enables researchers to identify potential disease-causing SNPs in an efficient manner . This enables rapid turnover of information and leads to further experimental SNP validation . The tool allows the user to compare and visualize SNPs from multiple experiments and to easily load SNP data onto the UCSC Genome browser for further detailed information .
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are small noncoding RNAs , 19-24 nucleotides in length , that regulate gene expression and are expressed aberrantly in most types of cancer . MiRNAs also have been detected in the blood of cancer patients and can serve as circulating biomarkers . It has been shown that secreted miRNAs within exosomes can be transferred from cell to cell and can regulate gene expression in the receiving cells by canonical binding to their target messenger RNAs . Here we show that tumor-secreted miR-21 and miR-29a also can function by another mechanism , by binding as ligands to receptors of the Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) family , murine TLR7 and human TLR8 , in immune cells , triggering a TLR-mediated prometastatic inflammatory response that ultimately may lead to tumor growth and metastasis . Thus , by acting as paracrine agonists of TLRs , secreted miRNAs are key regulators of the tumor microenvironment . This mechanism of action of miRNAs is implicated in tumor-immune system communication and is important in tumor growth and spread , thus representing a possible target for cancer treatment .
BACKGROUND Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation ( IR ) can lead to localized radiation injury of the skin and exposed cells suffer dsDNA breaks that may elicit cell death or stochastic changes . Little is known about the DNA damage response after high-dose exposure of the skin . Here , we investigate the cellular and DNA damage response in acutely irradiated minipig skin . METHODS AND FINDINGS IR-induced DNA damage , repair and cellular survival were studied in 15 cm(2) of minipig skin exposed in vivo to Co-60 \u03b3 rays . Skin biopsies of control and 4 h up to 96 days post exposure were investigated for radiation-induced foci ( RIF ) formation using \u03b3-H2AX , 53BP1 , and active ATM-p immunofluorescence . High-dose IR induced massive \u03b3-H2AX phosphorylation and high 53BP1 RIF numbers 4 h , 20 h after IR . As time progressed RIF numbers dropped to a low of <1% of keratinocytes at 28-70 days . The latter contained large RIFs that included ATM-p , indicating the accumulation of complex DNA damage . At 96 days most of the cells with RIFs had disappeared . The frequency of active-caspase-3-positive apoptotic cells was 17-fold increased 3 days after IR and remained >3-fold elevated at all subsequent time points . Replicating basal cells ( Ki67+ ) were reduced 3 days post IR followed by increased proliferation and recovery of epidermal cellularity after 28 days . CONCLUSIONS Acute high dose irradiation of minipig epidermis impaired stem cell replication and induced elevated apoptosis from 3 days onward . DNA repair cleared the high numbers of DBSs in skin cells , while RIFs that persisted in <1% cells marked complex and potentially lethal DNA damage up to several weeks after exposure . An elevated frequency of keratinocytes with persistent RIFs may thus serve as indicator of previous acute radiation exposure , which may be useful in the follow up of nuclear or radiological accident scenarios .
MYH7 mutations are found in of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) patients . Currently , mutational analysis is based on the sequencing of the coding exons and a few exon-flanking intronic nucleotides , resulting in omission of single-exon deletions and mutations in internal intronic , promoter , and 3 ' UTR regions . We amplified and sequenced large MYH7 fragments in 60 HCM patients without previously identified sarcomere mutations . Lack of aberrant PCR fragments excluded single-exon deletions in the patients . Instead , we identified several new rare intronic variants . An intron 26 single nucleotide insertion ( -5 insC ) was predicted to affect pre-mRNA splicing , but allele frequencies did not differ between patients and controls ( n = 150 ) . We found several rare promoter variants in the patients compared to controls , some of which were in binding sites for transcription factors and could thus affect gene expression . Only one rare 3 ' UTR variant ( c.*29T>C ) found in the patients was absent among the controls . This nucleotide change would not affect the binding of known microRNAs . Therefore , MYH7 mutations outside the coding exon sequences would be rarely found among HCM patients . However , changes in the promoter region could be linked to the risk of developing HCM . Further research to define the functional effect of these variants on gene expression is necessary to confirm the role of the MYH7 promoter in cardiac hypertrophy .
High resolution oligonucleotide array Comparative Genome Hybridization technology ( array-CGH ) has greatly assisted the recognition of the 1p36 contiguous gene deletion syndrome . The 1p36 deletion syndrome is considered to be one of the most common subtelomeric microdeletion syndromes and has an incidence of in 5000 live births , while respectively the " pure " 1p36 microduplication has not been reported so far . We present seven new patients who were referred for genetic evaluation due to Developmental Delay ( DD ) , Mental Retardation ( MR ) , and distinct dysmorphic features . They all had a wide phenotypic spectrum . In all cases previous standard karyotypes were negative . Array-CGH analysis revealed five patients with interstitial 1p36 microdeletion ( four de novo and one maternal ) and two patients with de novo reciprocal duplication of different sizes . These were the first reported " pure " 1p36 microduplication cases so far . Three of our patients carrying the 1p36 microdeletion syndrome were also found to have additional pathogenetic aberrations . These findings ( del 3q27.1 ; del 4q21.22-q22.1 ; del 16p13.3 ; dup 21q21.2-q21.3 ; del Xp22.12 ) might contribute to the patients ' severe phenotype , acting as additional modifiers of their clinical manifestations . We review and compare the clinical and array-CGH findings of our patients to previously reported cases with the aim of clearly delineating more accurate genotype-phenotype correlations for the 1p36 syndrome that could allow for a more precise prognosis .
Glycolysis is the initial step of glucose catabolism and is up-regulated in cancer cells ( the Warburg Effect ) . Such shifts toward a glycolytic phenotype have not been explored widely in other biological systems , and the molecular mechanisms underlying the shifts remain unknown . With proteomics , we observed increased glycolysis in disused human diaphragm muscle . In disused muscle , lung cancer , and H(2)O(2)-treated myotubes , we show up-regulation of the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme muscle-type phosphofructokinase ( PFKm , >2 fold , P<0.05 ) and accumulation of lactate ( >150% , P<0.05 ) . Using microRNA profiling , we identify miR-320a as a regulator of PFKm expression . Reduced miR-320a levels ( to \u223c50% of control , P<0.05 ) are associated with the increased PFKm in each of these diverse systems . Manipulation of miR-320a levels both in vitro and in vivo alters PFKm and lactate levels in the expected directions . Further , miR-320a appears to regulate oxidative stress-induced PFKm expression , and reduced miR-320a allows greater induction of glycolysis in response to H(2)O(2) treatment . We show that this microRNA-mediated regulation occurs through PFKm's 3 ' untranslated region and that Ets proteins are involved in the regulation of PFKm via miR-320a . These findings suggest that oxidative stress-responsive microRNA-320a may regulate glycolysis broadly within nature .
Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) is one of the most important mediators of angiogenesis . Single-chain ( sc)-VEGF protein containing an N-terminal Cys-tag has been designed for site-specific modification with a variety of imaging and therapeutic moieties . Site-specific labeling of scVEGF with thiol-reactive prosthetic group , N-[2-(4-(18)F-fluorobenzamido) ethyl ] maleimide ( [ (18)F]FBEM ) for positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging of VEFGR may provide a new tracer which has great potential for clinical translation.Methods : [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF was synthesized by site-specific conjugation of ( 18)F-FBEM to a thiol group in Cys-tag of scVEGF at room temperature . The functional activity after labeling was tested by immunofluorescence staining , cellular uptake and efflux . The tumor targeting and in vivo properties were evaluated by biodistribution and microPET studies in tumor-bearing mice.Results : The radiolabeling yield and specific activity of [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF were 20.6 <FFFD> 15.1% ( based on starting [ (18)F]FBEM , uncorrected , n = 5 ) and 58.8 <FFFD> 12.4 GBq/<FFFD>mol , respectively . Noninvasive microPET and direct tissue sampling experiments demonstrated that [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF had VEGFR specific tumor uptake in MDA-MB-435 , U87MG and 4T1 xenograft models . The optimal tumor uptake was achieved at 2 h p.i. , which can be partially , but significantly blocked by co-injection of non-labeled scVEGF protein . Overall , [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF showed VEGFR specific tumor uptake.Conclusion : The scVEGF was site-specifically labeled with ( 18)F via [ (18)F]FBEM prosthetic group and the tracer [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF exhibited high receptor binding affinity and tumor targeting efficacy . Further study of [ (18)F ] FBEM-scVEGF to evaluate angiogenesis in cancer and other disease types is warranted .
Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) induces an uncoordinated S-phase-like cellular environment coupled with multiple prophase-like events in cells replicating the virus . The EBV encoded Ser/Thr kinase BGLF4 has been shown to induce premature chromosome condensation through activation of condensin and topoisomerase II and reorganization of the nuclear lamina to facilitate the nuclear egress of nucleocapsids in a pathway mimicking Cdk1 . However , the observation that RB is hyperphosphorylated in the presence of BGLF4 raised the possibility that BGLF4 may have a Cdk2-like activity to promote S-phase progression . Here , we investigated the regulatory effects of BGLF4 on cell cycle progression and found that S-phase progression and DNA synthesis were interrupted by BGLF4 in mammalian cells . Expression of BGLF4 did not compensate Cdk1 defects for DNA replication in S. cerevisiae . Using time-lapse microscopy , we found the fate of individual HeLa cells was determined by the expression level of BGLF4 . In addition to slight cell growth retardation , BGLF4 elicits abnormal chromosomal structure and micronucleus formation in 293 and NCP-TW01 cells . In Saos-2 cells , BGLF4 induced the hyperphosphorylation of co-transfected RB , while E2F1 was not released from RB-E2F1 complexes . The E2F1 regulated activities of the cyclin D1 and ZBRK1 promoters were suppressed by BGLF4 in a dose dependent manner . Detection with phosphoamino acid specific antibodies revealed that , in addition to Ser780 , phosphorylation of the DNA damage-responsive Ser612 on RB was enhanced by BGLF4 . Taken together , our study indicates that BGLF4 may directly or indirectly induce a DNA damage signal that eventually interferes with host DNA synthesis and delays S-phase progression .
BACKGROUND Modern allotetraploid cotton contains an " A " and " D " genome from an ancestral polyploidy event that occurred approximately 1-2 million years ago . Diploid A- and D-genome species can be compared to the A- and D-genomes found within these allotetraploids to make evolutionary inferences about polyploidy . In this paper we present a comprehensive EST assembly derived from diploid and model allotetraploid cottons and demonstrate several evolutionary inferences regarding genic evolution that can be drawn from these data . RESULTS We generated a set of cotton expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) , comprising approximately 4.4 million Sanger and next-generation ( 454 ) transcripts supplemented by approximately 152 million Illumina reads from diploid and allotetraploid cottons . From the EST alignments we inferred 259,192 genome-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) . Molecular evolutionary analyses of protein-coding regions demonstrate that the rate of nucleotide substitution has increased among both allotetraploid genomes relative to the diploids , and that the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions has increased in one of the two polyploid lineages we sampled . We also use these SNPs to show that a surprisingly high percentage of duplicate genes ( show a signature of non-independent evolution in the allotetraploid nucleus , having experienced one or more episodes of nonreciprocal homoeologous recombination ( NRHR ) . CONCLUSIONS In this study we characterize the functional and mutational properties of the cotton transcriptome , produce a large genome-specific SNP database , and detect illegitimate genetic exchanges between duplicate genomes sharing a common allotetraploid nucleus . Our findings have important implications for our understanding of the consequences of polyploidy and duplicate gene evolution . We demonstrate that cotton genes have experienced an increased rate of molecular evolution following duplication by polyploidy , and that polyploidy has enabled considerable levels of nonreciprocal exchange between homoeologous genes .
OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to immunohistochemically evaluate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-1 , MMP- 2 , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase ( TIMP)-1 , TIMP-2 , and podoplanin in oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) . Immunohistochemical staining of podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessel density ( LVD ) was also assessed . STUDY DESIGN Forty cases of OSCC were analyzed by immunohistochemistry . RESULTS MMP-2 , MMP-10 , TIMP-1 , TIMP-2 , and podoplanin were detected in each of the 40 OSCC cases . The expression of MMP-2 was significantly correlated with histologic grade . The expression of podoplanin was positively correlated with gender and negatively correlated with tumor size . A significant positive correlation was also detected between LVD and the presence of lymph node metastases , gender , age , and diameter of the lymph node ( if involved ) , as well as histologic grade . CONCLUSIONS The results are suggestive of important roles that MMP-2 , MMP-10 , TIMP-2 , and podoplanin play in pathologic processes of OSCC , including invasion . Our findings also suggest that LVD may play a role in lymphatic metastasis and tumor progression .
Escherichia coli molecular hydrogen ( H(2) ) production was studied during mixed carbon ( glucose and glycerol ) fermentation at pH 6.5 . Wild type cells in the assays supplemented with glucose produced H(2) at fold lower level than cells grown on glucose only . When compared to the wild type , H(2) production in the assays added with glucose was decreased by fold in fhlA , hyfG and double fhlA hyfG mutants and by fold in hyaB , hybC , and double hyaB hybC mutants . However , in the assays with glycerol , no measurable H(2) production was detected . Taken together , these results suggest that during mixed carbon fermentation , H(2) could be produced with low efficiency via Hyd-3 and Hyd-4 . This is a novel finding for Hyd-4 activity at pH 6.5 . The insignificant decrease of H(2) production in the strains with defects in Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 was probably due to an interaction between the Hyd enzymes and their organization in the bacterial membrane . In the glucose assays , H(2) production in the wild type cells was inhibited fold by 0.3mM N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide ( DCCD ) , an inhibitor of the F(0)F(1)-ATPase . This inhibition was the same for fhlA and hyfG fhlA mutants but not hyaB , hybC , hyfG or hyaB hybC mutants . The results indicate that the FhlA protein coded by the fhlA gene might interact with the F(0)F(1)-ATPase . We propose that this interaction is mediated by mixed carbon fermentation .
Congenital gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) deficiency manifests as absent or incomplete sexual maturation and infertility . Although the disease exhibits marked locus and allelic heterogeneity , with the causal mutations being both rare and private , one causal mutation in the prokineticin receptor , PROKR2 L173R , appears unusually prevalent among GnRH-deficient patients of diverse geographic and ethnic origins . To track the genetic ancestry of PROKR2 L173R , haplotype mapping was performed in 22 unrelated patients with GnRH deficiency carrying L173R and their 30 first-degree relatives . The mutation's age was estimated using a haplotype-decay model . Thirteen subjects were informative and in all of them the mutation was present on the same kb haplotype whose population frequency is \u226410% . Thus , PROKR2 L173R represents a founder mutation whose age is estimated at approximately 9000 years . Inheritance of PROKR2 L173R-associated GnRH deficiency was complex with highly variable penetrance among carriers , influenced by additional mutations in the other PROKR2 allele ( recessive inheritance ) or another gene ( digenicity ) . The paradoxical identification of an ancient founder mutation that impairs reproduction has intriguing implications for the inheritance mechanisms of PROKR2 L173R-associated GnRH deficiency and for the relevant processes of evolutionary selection , including potential selective advantages of mutation carriers in genes affecting reproduction .
Phenotype-driven approaches to gene discovery using inbred mice have been instrumental in identifying genetic determinants of inherited blood dyscrasias . The recessive mutant scat ( severe combined anemia and thrombocytopenia ) alternates between crisis and remission episodes , indicating an aberrant regulatory feedback mechanism common to erythrocyte and platelet formation . Here , we identify a missense mutation ( G125V ) in the scat Rasa3 gene , encoding a Ras GTPase activating protein ( RasGAP ) , and elucidate the mechanism producing crisis episodes . The mutation causes mislocalization of RASA3 to the cytosol in scat red cells where it is inactive , leading to increased GTP-bound Ras . Erythropoiesis is severely blocked in scat crisis mice , and succumb during the second crisis ( d of age ) from catastrophic hematopoietic failure in the spleen and bone marrow . Megakaryopoiesis is also defective during crisis . Notably , the scat phenotype is recapitulated in zebrafish when rasa3 is silenced . These results highlight a critical , conserved , and nonredundant role for RASA3 in vertebrate hematopoiesis .
BACKGROUND The MYB superfamily constitutes one of the most abundant groups of transcription factors described in plants . Nevertheless , their functions appear to be highly diverse and remain rather unclear . To date , no genome-wide characterization of this gene family has been conducted in a legume species . Here we report the first genome-wide analysis of the whole MYB superfamily in a legume species , soybean ( Glycine max ) , including the gene structures , phylogeny , chromosome locations , conserved motifs , and expression patterns , as well as a comparative genomic analysis with Arabidopsis . RESULTS A total of 244 R2R3-MYB genes were identified and further classified into 48 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparative analysis with their putative orthologs , showed both gene loss and duplication events . The phylogenetic analysis showed that most characterized MYB genes with similar functions are clustered in the same subfamily , together with the identification of orthologs by synteny analysis , functional conservation among subgroups of MYB genes was strongly indicated . The phylogenetic relationships of each subgroup of MYB genes were well supported by the highly conserved intron/exon structures and motifs outside the MYB domain . Synonymous nucleotide substitution ( dN/dS ) analysis showed that the soybean MYB DNA-binding domain is under strong negative selection . The chromosome distribution pattern strongly indicated that genome-wide segmental and tandem duplication contribute to the expansion of soybean MYB genes . In addition , we found that\u2009 of soybean R2R3-MYB genes had undergone alternative splicing events , producing a variety of transcripts from a single gene , which illustrated the extremely high complexity of transcriptome regulation . Comparative expression profile analysis of R2R3-MYB genes in soybean and Arabidopsis revealed that MYB genes play conserved and various roles in plants , which is indicative of a divergence in function . CONCLUSIONS In this study we identified the largest MYB gene family in plants known to date . Our findings indicate that members of this large gene family may be involved in different plant biological processes , some of which may be potentially involved in legume-specific nodulation . Our comparative genomics analysis provides a solid foundation for future functional dissection of this family gene .
The Sleeping Beauty ( SB ) transposon is a nonviral , integrating vector system with proven efficacy in preclinical animal models , and thus holds promise for future clinical applications . However , SB has a close-to-random insertion profile that could lead to genotoxic effects , thereby presenting a potential safety issue . We evaluated zinc finger ( ZF ) DNA-binding domains ( DBDs ) for their abilities to introduce a bias into SB's insertion profile . E2C , that binds a unique site in the erbB-2 gene , mediated locus-specific transposon insertions at low frequencies . A novel ZF targeting LINE1 repeats , ZF-B , showed specific binding to an 18-bp site represented by copies in the human genome . We mapped SB insertions using linear-amplification ( LAM)-PCR and Illumina sequencing . Targeted insertions with ZF-B peaked at approximately fourfold enrichment of transposition around ZF-B binding sites yielding overall frequency of insertion into LINE1 . A decrease in the ZF-B dataset with respect to transposon insertions in genes was found , suggesting that LINE1 repeats act as a sponge that " soak up " a fraction of SB insertions and thereby redirect them away from genes . Improvements in ZF technology and a careful choice of targeted genomic regions may improve the safety profile of SB for future clinical applications .
Autism is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with complex genetic mechanism underlying its etiology . Recent studies revealed that a few single de novo copy number variants of genomic DNA ( copy number variants [ CNVs] ) are pathogenic and causal in some sporadic cases , adding support to the hypothesis that some sporadic autism might be caused by single rare mutation with large clinical effect . In this study , we report the detection of two novel private CNVs simultaneously in a male patient with autism . These two CNVs include a microduplication of Mb at chromosome 4q12-13.1 that was transmitted from his mother and a microdeletion of Mb at 5q32 that was transmitted from his father . Several genes such as LPHN3 , POU4F3 , SH3RF2 , and TCERG1 mapped to these two regions have psychiatric implications . However , the parents had only mild degree of attention deficit symptoms but did not demonstrate any obvious autistic symptoms or psychopathology . Our findings indicate that each of these two CNVs alone may not be pathogenic enough to cause clinical symptoms in their respective carriers , and hence they can be transmitted within each individual family . However , concomitant presence of these two CNVs might result in the clinical phenotypes of the affected patient reported here . Thus , our report of this family may represent an example to show that two hits of CNV and the presence of compound heterozygosity might be important mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of autism .
Thellungiella salsuginea , a close relative of Arabidopsis , represents an extremophile model for abiotic stress tolerance studies . We present the draft sequence of the T. salsuginea genome , assembled based on coverage to seven chromosomes with a coding capacity of at least 28,457 genes . This genome provides resources and evidence about the nature of defense mechanisms constituting the genetic basis underlying plant abiotic stress tolerance . Comparative genomics and experimental analyses identified genes related to cation transport , abscisic acid signaling , and wax production prominent in T. salsuginea as possible contributors to its success in stressful environments .
We demonstrate that reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) plays an important role in the process of apoptosis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) which is induced by the radiation of 900 MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic field ( RFEMF ) at a specific absorption rate ( SAR ) of W/kg when the exposure lasts longer than two hours . The apoptosis is induced through the mitochondrial pathway and mediated by activating ROS and caspase-3 , and decreasing the mitochondrial potential . The activation of ROS is triggered by the conformation disturbance of lipids , protein , and DNA induced by the exposure of GSM RFEMF . Although human PBMC was found to have a self-protection mechanism of releasing carotenoid in response to oxidative stress to lessen the further increase of ROS , the imbalance between the antioxidant defenses and ROS formation still results in an increase of cell death with the exposure time and can cause about 37% human PBMC death in eight hours .
BACKGROUND Cancer , much like most human disease , is routinely studied by utilizing model organisms . Of these model organisms , mice are often dominant . However , our assumptions of functional equivalence fail to consider the opportunity for divergence conferred by Million Years ( MY ) of independent evolution between these species . For a given set of human disease related genes , it is therefore important to determine if functional equivalency has been retained between species . In this study we test the hypothesis that cancer associated genes have different patterns of substitution akin to adaptive evolution in different mammal lineages . RESULTS Our analysis of the current literature and colon cancer databases identified 22 genes exhibiting colon cancer associated germline mutations . We identified orthologs for these 22 genes across a set of high coverage ( >6X ) vertebrate genomes . Analysis of these orthologous datasets revealed significant levels of positive selection . Evidence of lineage-specific positive selection was identified in 14 genes in both ancestral and extant lineages . Lineage-specific positive selection was detected in the ancestral Euarchontoglires and Hominidae lineages for STK11 , in the ancestral primate lineage for CDH1 , in the ancestral Murinae lineage for both SDHC and MSH6 genes and the ancestral Muridae lineage for TSC1 . CONCLUSION Identifying positive selection in the Primate , Hominidae , Muridae and Murinae lineages suggests an ancestral functional shift in these genes between the rodent and primate lineages . Analyses such as this , combining evolutionary theory and predictions - along with medically relevant data , can thus provide us with important clues for modeling human diseases .
Overexpression of the Candida albicans ATP-binding cassette transporter CaCdr1p causes clinically significant resistance to azole drugs including fluconazole ( FLC ) . Screening of a x 10(6) member D-octapeptide combinatorial library that concentrates library members at the yeast cell surface identified RC21v3 , a 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylbenzenesulphonyl derivative of the D-octapeptide D-NH(2) -FFKWQRRR-CONH(2) , as a potent and stereospecific inhibitor of CaCdr1p . RC21v3 chemosensitized Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains overexpressing CaCdr1p but not other fungal ABC transporters , the C. albicans MFS transporter CaMdr1p or the azole target enzyme CaErg11p , to FLC . RC21v3 also chemosensitized clinical C. albicans isolates overexpressing CaCDR1 to FLC , even when CaCDR2 was overexpressed . Specific targeting of CaCdr1p by RC21v3 was confirmed by spontaneous RC21v3 chemosensitization-resistant suppressor mutants of S. cerevisiae expressing CaCdr1p . The suppressor mutations introduced a positive charge beside , or within , extracellular loops 1 , 3 , 4 and 6 of CaCdr1p or an aromatic residue near the extracytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 5 . The mutations did not affect CaCdr1p localization or CaCdr1p ATPase activity but some increased susceptibility to the CaCdr1p substrates FLC , rhodamine 6G , rhodamine 123 and cycloheximide . The suppressor mutations showed that the drug-like CaCdr1p inhibitors FK506 , enniatin , milbemycin \u03b111 and milbemycin \u03b29 have modes of action similar to RC21v3 .
Archaeal and eukaryotic B-family DNA polymerases ( pols ) mainly replicate chromosomal DNA but stall at lesions , which are often bypassed with Y-family pols . In this study , a B-family pol Vent ( exo(-) ) from the euryarchaeon Thermococcus litoralis was studied with three types of DNA lesions-N(2)-alkylG , O(6)-alkylG , and an abasic ( AP ) site-in comparison with a model Y-family pol Dpo4 from Sulfolobus solfataricus , to better understand the effects of various DNA modifications on binding , bypass efficiency , and fidelity of pols . Vent ( exo(-) ) readily bypassed N(2)-methyl(Me)G and O(6)-MeG , but was strongly blocked at O(6)-benzyl(Bz)G and N(2)-BzG , whereas Dpo4 efficiently bypassed N(2)-MeG and N(2)-BzG and partially bypassed O(6)-MeG and O(6)-BzG . Vent ( exo(-) ) bypassed an AP site to an extent greater than Dpo4 , corresponding with steady-state kinetic data . Vent ( exo(-) ) showed 180- , and 300-fold decreases in catalytic efficiency ( k(cat)/K(m) ) for nucleotide insertion opposite an AP site , N(2)-MeG , and O(6)-MeG but and 5000-fold decreases opposite O(6)-BzG and N(2)-BzG , respectively , as compared to G , whereas Dpo4 showed little or only decreases opposite N(2)-MeG and N(2)-BzG but decreases opposite O(6)-MeG , O(6)-BzG , and the AP site . Vent ( exo(-) ) preferentially misinserted G opposite N(2)-MeG , T opposite O(6)-MeG , and A opposite an AP site and N(2)-BzG , while Dpo4 favored correct C insertion opposite those lesions . Vent ( exo(-) ) and Dpo4 both bound modified DNAs with affinities similar to unmodified DNA . Our results indicate that Vent ( exo(-) ) is as or more efficient as Dpo4 in synthesis opposite O(6)-MeG and AP lesions , whereas Dpo4 is much or more efficient opposite ( only ) N(2)-alkylGs than Vent ( exo(-) ) , irrespective of DNA-binding affinity . Our data also suggest that Vent ( exo(-) ) accepts nonbulky DNA lesions ( e.g. , N(2)- or O(6)-MeG and an AP site ) as manageable substrates despite causing error-prone synthesis , whereas Dpo4 strongly favors minor-groove N(2)-alkylG lesions over major-groove or noninstructive lesions .
Cardiac \u03b1-tropomyosin ( Tm ) single-site mutations D175N and E180G cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( FHC ) . Previous studies have shown that these mutations increase both Ca(2+) sensitivity and residual contractile activity at low Ca(2+) concentrations , which causes incomplete relaxation during diastole resulting in hypertrophy and sarcomeric disarray . However , the molecular basis for the cause and the difference in the severity of the manifested phenotypes of disease are not known . In this work we have ( 1 ) used ATPase studies using reconstituted thin filaments in solution to show that these FHC mutants result in an increase in Ca(2+) sensitivity and an increased residual level of ATPase , ( 2 ) shown that both FHC mutants increase the rate of cleavage at R133 , residues N-terminal to the mutations , when free and bound to actin , ( 3 ) shown that for Tm-E180G , the increase in the rate of cleavage is greater than that for D175N , and ( 4 ) shown that for E180G , cleavage also occurs at a new site 53 residues C-terminal to E180G , in parallel with cleavage at R133 . The long-range decreases in dynamic stability due to these two single-site mutations suggest increases in flexibility that may weaken the ability of Tm to inhibit activity at low Ca(2+) concentrations for D175N and to a greater degree for E180G , which may contribute to differences in the severity of FHC .
MicroRNAs ( miRs ) are small non-coding RNAs that recently emerged as potent regulators of gene expression . The members of the miR-17-92 cluster have been shown to control endothelial cell functions and neovascularization ; however , the regulation and function of the cluster in endothelial cell lineage commitment has not been explored . This project aimed to test the role of the miR-17-92 cluster during endothelial differentiation . We demonstrate that miR-17 , miR-18 , miR-19 and miR-20 are increased upon the induction of endothelial cell differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells . In contrast , miR-92a and the primary miR-17-92 transcript were downregulated . The inhibition of each individual miR of the cluster by cholesterol-modified antagomirs did not affect endothelial marker gene expression . Moreover , the combination of all antagomirs had no effect . These findings illustrate that although the miR-17-92 cluster regulates vascular integrity and angiogenesis , none of the members has a significant impact on the endothelial differentiation of pluripotent stem cells .
Several lines of evidence indicate that neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) destruction and disassembly is an early phenomenon in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) . Here we analyzed by confocal and electron microscopy the NMJ structure in the diaphragm of SOD1G93A mice at symptom onset . In these mice , which provide a model for familial ALS , diaphragm denervation ( as well as gastrocnemius denervation ( was found . In addition , the size of the synaptic vesicle pool was reduced and alterations of mitochondria were observed in approximately 40% of the remaining presynaptic terminals . Chronic treatment of SOD1G93A mice with the anabolic steroid nandrolone during the presymptomatic stage preserved the diaphragm muscle mass and features indicative of synaptic activity . These features were represented by the number of vesicles docked within 200 nm from the presynaptic membrane and area of acetylcholine receptor clusters . Structural preservation of mitochondria was documented in presynaptic terminals . However , innervation of diaphragm muscle fibers was only slightly increased in nandrolone-treated SOD1-mutant mice . Altogether the results point out and define fine structural alterations of diaphragm NMJs in the murine model of familial ALS at symptom onset , and indicate that nandrolone may prevent or delay structural alterations in NMJ mitochondria and stimulate presynaptic activity but does not prevent muscle denervation during the disease .
Angiogenesis is critical for cancer growth and metastasis . Steps of angiogenesis are energy consuming , while vascular endothelial cells are highly glycolytic . Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) is a highly vascular tumor and this enhances its aggressiveness . D-amino acid oxidase ( DAO ) is a promising therapeutic protein that induces oxidative stress upon acting on its substrates . Oxidative stress-energy depletion ( OSED ) therapy was recently reported ( El Sayed et al. , Cancer Gene Ther , 19 , 1-18 , 2012 ) . OSED combines DAO-induced oxidative stress with energy depletion caused by glycolytic inhibitors such as 3-bromopyruvate ( 3BP ) , a hexokinase II inhibitor that depleted ATP in cancer cells and induced production of hydrogen peroxide. 3BP disturbs the Warburg effect and antagonizes effects of lactate and pyruvate ( El Sayed et al. , J Bioenerg Biomembr , 44 , 61-79 , 2012 ) . Citrate is a natural organic acid capable of inhibiting glycolysis by targeting phosphofructokinase . Here , we report that DAO , 3BP and citrate significantly inhibited angiogenesis , decreased the number of vascular branching points and shortened the length of vascular tubules . OSED delayed the growth of C6/DAO glioma cells. 3BP combined with citrate delayed the growth of C6 glioma cells and decreased significantly the number and size of C6 glioma colonies in soft agar . Human GBM cells ( U373MG ) were resistant to chemotherapy e.g. cisplatin and cytosine arabinoside , while 3BP was effective in decreasing the viability and disturbing the morphology of U373MG cells .
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the Expression and correlation of cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGF ) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma . METHOD In this study , expression levels of COX-2 , VEGF were examined in 58 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 38 patients with inflammation in nasopharyngeal mucosa by immunohistochemistry method . RESULT The expression of COX-2 , VEGF were higher in nasopharyngeal carcinoma than those in nasopharyngeal mucosa ( P < 0.05 ) , and they had some correlation with the invasion and lymphatic metastasis and with the clinical stage of nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( P < 0.05 ) . The expression of COX-2 was positively correlated with that of VEGF ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION The coexpression of COX-2 and VEGF may play animportant role in the carcinogenesis and development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma , and they may prom ( see text ) lymph node metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma .
PURPOSE We describe the anticancer activity of ganetespib , a novel non-geldanamycin heat shock protein 90 ( HSP90 ) inhibitor , in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) models . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN The activity of ganetespib was compared with that of the geldanamycin 17-AAG in biochemical assays , cell lines , and xenografts , and evaluated in an ERBB2 YVMA-driven mouse lung adenocarcinoma model . RESULTS Ganetespib blocked the ability of HSP90 to bind to biotinylated geldanamycin and disrupted the association of HSP90 with its cochaperone , p23 , more potently than 17-AAG . In genomically defined NSCLC cell lines , ganetespib caused depletion of receptor tyrosine kinases , extinguishing of downstream signaling , inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis with IC(50) values ranging 2 to 30 nmol/L , substantially lower than those required for 17-AAG ( 20-3,500 nmol/L ) . Ganetespib was also approximately 20-fold more potent in isogenic Ba/F3 pro-B cells rendered IL-3 independent by expression of EGFR and ERBB2 mutants . In mice bearing NCI-H1975 ( EGFR L858R/T790M ) xenografts , ganetespib was rapidly eliminated from plasma and normal tissues but was maintained in tumor with t(1/2) 58.3 hours , supporting once-weekly dosing experiments , in which ganetespib produced greater tumor growth inhibition than 17-AAG . However , after a single dose , reexpression of mutant EGFR occurred by 72 hours , correlating with reversal of antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects . Consecutive day dosing resulted in xenograft regressions , accompanied by more sustained pharmacodynamic effects . Ganetespib also showed activity against mouse lung adenocarcinomas driven by oncogenic ERBB2 YVMA . CONCLUSIONS Ganetespib has greater potency than 17-AAG and potential efficacy against several NSCLC subsets , including those harboring EGFR or ERBB2 mutation .
Muscle endplates become denervated in mice that express mutations of human superoxide dismutase 1 ( hSOD1 ) , models of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . This denervation is especially marked in fast limb muscles , and precedes death of motor neuron somata . This study used mice that expressed yellow fluorescent protein ( YFP ) in neurons to investigate changes in the morphology and function of axons and motor terminals innervating a fast forelimb muscle ( epitrochleoanconeus , ETA ) in presymptomatic and symptomatic hSOD1-G85R mice , compared to those in mice that express wild-type ( wt ) hSOD1 . The percentage of endplates ( identified using fluorescently-labeled \u03b1-bungarotoxin ) innervated by motor terminals remained high in presymptomatic SOD1-G85R mice , but fell to in symptomatic mice . The number of large diameter ( \u22654 \u03bcm ) axons in the ETA nerve also decreased as mice became symptomatic , and endplate innervation correlated best with the number of large diameter axons . Motor terminal function was assessed using changes in terminal YFP fluorescence evoked by trains of action potentials ; different components of the pH-dependent YFP signals reflect stimulation-induced Ca2+ entry and vesicular exo/endocytosis . Most visible motor terminals ( >90% ) remained capable of responding to nerve stimulation in both pre- and symptomatic hSOD1-G85R mice , but with functional alterations . Responses in presymptomatic terminals suggested reduced acidification and increased vesicular release , whereas symptomatic terminals exhibited increased acidification and reduced vesicular release . The fact that most remaining terminals were able to respond to nerve stimulation suggests that motor terminal-protective therapies might contribute to preserving neuromuscular function in fALS mice .
BACKGROUND It has been proven that metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 ( MACC1 ) is a new gene that is related to the invasion and metastasis of tumors . MACC1 also regulates c-met expression . The aim of this study is to explore the expressions of MACC1 and hepatocyte growth factor receptor ( c-met ) , and its relationship with invasion , metastasis , and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . METHODS MACC1 and c-met expressions were detected in 103 cases of NSCLC and 40 cases of neighboring normal lung cancer tissue using immunohistochemistry . RESULTS MACC1 and c-met expressions were significantly higher in lung cancer tissues than that in neighboring normal tissue ( P<0.001 ) . MACC1 and c-met expressions were associated with poor differentiation , advanced T stages , lymph node metastasis , and advanced TNM stages ( P<0.05 ) of NSCLC , but not with sex , age , smoking , and histological classification ( P>0.05 ) . In addition , a positive correlation between MACC1 and c-met expressions was observed ( r=0.403 , P<0.001 ) . The result from the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the five-year survival rate in patients with positive MACC1 and c-met expressions was remarkanly lower than that in patients with negative expressions ( P<0.05 ) . The result from the Cox regression analysis showed that MACC1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC ( P=0.026 ) . CONCLUSIONS MACC1 and c-met have an important function in the differentiation , invasion , and metastasis of NSCLC . MACC1 and c-met have poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC . Moreover , MACC1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC .
Muir-Torre syndrome ( MTS ) , a phenotypic variant of the more common hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome , or Lynch syndrome , is an autosomal dominantly inherited condition that combines at least one cutaneous sebaceous neoplasm and at least one visceral malignancy . Most patients ( with MTS carry mutations in the MSH2 gene ; less than 10% of the cases are associated with a mutation MLH1 gene , and only 3 MTS patients with a pathogenic MSH6 mutation have been previously documented . We report a family affected with MTS in which 3 members ( father and 2 sons ) were found to harbor a missense mutation c.2633T>C ( p.V878A ) in exon 4 of the MSH6 gene .
Epigenetic changes in pediatric neuroblastoma may contribute to the aggressive pathophysiology of this disease , but little is known about the basis for such changes . In this study , we examined a role for the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B , in particular , the truncated isoform DNMT3B7 , which is generated frequently in cancer . To investigate if aberrant DNMT3B transcripts alter DNA methylation , gene expression , and phenotypic character in neuroblastoma , we measured DNMT3B expression in primary tumors . Higher levels of DNMT3B7 were detected in differentiated ganglioneuroblastomas compared to undifferentiated neuroblastomas , suggesting that expression of DNMT3B7 may induce a less aggressive clinical phenotype . To test this hypothesis , we investigated the effects of enforced DNMT3B7 expression in neuroblastoma cells , finding a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo . DNMT3B7-positive cells had higher levels of total genomic methylation and a dramatic decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN family members that comprise AP1 transcription factors . Consistent with an established antagonistic relationship between AP1 expression and retinoic acid receptor activity , increased differentiation was seen in the DNMT3B7-expressing neuroblastoma cells following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) compared to controls . Our results indicate that DNMT3B7 modifies the epigenome in neuroblastoma cells to induce changes in gene expression , inhibit tumor growth , and increase sensitivity to ATRA .
Tumor cells are surrounded by infiltrating inflammatory cells , such as lymphocytes , neutrophils , macrophages , and mast cells . A body of evidence indicates that mast cells are associated with various types of tumors . Although role of mast cells can be directly related to their granule content , their function in angiogenesis and tumor progression remains obscure . This study aims to understand the role of mast cells in these processes . Tumors were chemically induced in BALB/c mice and tumor progression was divided into Phases I , II and III . Phase I tumors exhibited a large number of mast cells , which increased in phase II and remained unchanged in phase III . The expression of mouse mast cell protease ( mMCP)-4 , mMCP-5 , mMCP-6 , mMCP-7 , and carboxypeptidase A were analyzed at the 3 stages . Our results show that with the exception of mMCP-4 expression of these mast cell chymase ( mMCP-5 ) , tryptases ( mMCP-6 and 7 ) , and carboxypeptidase A ( mMC-CPA ) increased during tumor progression . Chymase and tryptase activity increased at all stages of tumor progression whereas the number of mast cells remained constant from phase II to III . The number of new blood vessels increased significantly in phase I , while in phases II and III an enlargement of existing blood vessels occurred . In vitro , mMCP-6 and 7 are able to induce vessel formation . The present study suggests that mast cells are involved in induction of angiogenesis in the early stages of tumor development and in modulating blood vessel growth in the later stages of tumor progression .
Coronavirus envelope ( E ) proteins are short ( residues ) polypeptides that contain at least one transmembrane ( TM ) domain and a cluster of 2-3 juxtamembrane cysteines . These proteins are involved in viral morphogenesis and tropism , and their absence leads in some cases to aberrant virions , or to viral attenuation . In common to other viroporins , coronavirus envelope proteins increase membrane permeability to ions . Although an NMR-based model for the TM domain of the E protein in the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus ( SARS-CoV E ) has been reported , structural data and biophysical studies of full length E proteins are not available because efficient expression and purification methods for these proteins are lacking . Herein we have used a novel fusion protein consisting of a modified \u03b2-barrel to purify both wild type and cysteine-less mutants of two representatives of coronavirus E proteins : the shortest ( 76 residues ) , from SARS-CoV E , and one of the longest ( 109 residues ) , from the infectious bronchitis virus ( IBV E ) . The fusion construct was subsequently cleaved with cyanogen bromide and all polypeptides were obtained with high purity . This is an approach that can be used in other difficult hydrophobic peptides .
Semaphorin 5A , a member of semaphorin family , was originally identified as axonal guidance factor functioning during neuronal development . Previously , we showed that the expression of semaphorin 5A might contribute to the metastasis of gastric cancer . However , its functional roles and mechanism(s) in invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer remain unclear . By using human gastric caner cell lines Parental SGC7901 , SGC7901-siScrambled and SGC7901-siSema 5A , we found that semaphorin 5A significantly promoted the invasive and metastatic abilities of gastric cancer cell in vitro . Semaphorin 5A increased the expression of MMP9 by activating phosphorylated ErK1/2 in gastric cancer cell . Furthermore , MEK inhibitor PD98059 and MMP9 antibody ( Ab ) significantly inhibited in vitro invasive and metastatic abilities induced by semaphorin 5A . Taken together , the present work revealed a novel function of semaphorin 5A that the existence of semaphorin 5A could promote invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer by regulating MMP9 expression , at least partially , via the MEK/ERKs signal transduction pathway . Semaphorin 5A and its regulated molecules could be the potential targets for cancer therapy .
Exposure of cells to UV light from the sun causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers in DNA that have the potential to lead to mutation and cancer . In humans , pyrimidine dimers are removed from the genome in the form of nt-long oligomers by concerted dual incisions . Though nearly 50 y of excision repair research has uncovered many details of UV photoproduct damage recognition and removal , the fate of the excised oligonucleotides and , in particular , the ultimate fate of the chemically very stable pyrimidine dimers remain unknown . Physiologically relevant UV doses introduce hundreds of thousands of pyrimidine dimers in diploid human cells , which are excised from the genome within h . Once removed from the genome , " where do all the dimers go? " In a recent study we addressed this question . Although our study did not determine the fate of the dimer itself , it revealed that the excised is released from the duplex in a tight complex with the transcription/repair factor TFIIH . This finding combined with recent reports that base and oligonucleotide products of the base and double-strand break repair pathways also make stable complexes with the cognate repair enzymes , and that these complexes activate the MAP kinase and checkpoint signaling pathways , respectively , raises the possibility that TFIIH-30-mer excision complexes may play a role in signaling reactions in response to UV damage .
Gadd45a , the first well-defined p53 downstream gene , can be induced by multiple DNA-damaging agents , which plays important roles in the control of cell cycle checkpoint , DNA repair process and signaling transduction . Our previous findings suggested that Gadd45a maintains cell-cell adhesion and cell contact inhibition . However , little is known about how Gadd45a participates in the suppression of malignancy in human cancer cells . To examine the functions of Gadd45a in cell invasion and metastasis , we performed the adhesion , wound-healing and transwell assays in Gadd45a ( +/+ ) and Gadd45a ( -/- ) MEF cell lines . We found the adhesion , migration and invasive abilities were much higher in Gadd45a deficient cells . We furthermore applied high-throughput cDNA microarray analysis and bioinformatics analysis to analyze the mechanisms of Gadd45a gene in invasion and metastasis . Compared with the Gadd45a wild type cells , the Gadd45a deficient cells showed a wide range of transcripts alterations . The altered gene pathways were predicted by the MAS software , which indicated focal adhesion,cell communication,ECM-receptor interaction as the three main pathways . Real-time PCR was employed to validate the differentially expressed genes . Interestingly , we figured out that the deregulations of these genes are caused neither by genomic aberrations nor methylation status . These findings provided a novel insight that Gadd45a may involve in tumor progression by regulating related genes expressions .
Genetic and epigenetic changes in the von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) tumour suppressor gene are common in sporadic conventional ( clear cell ) renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) . The effects on VHL expression are unknown but increased understanding may be relevant clinically , either in terms of prognosis or in therapy selection . We have examined the expression of VHL mutant RNA in 84 ccRCC tumours previously screened for mutations in genomic DNA , 56 of which contained 52 unique mutations or polymorphisms . Based on the predicted change to the primary amino acid sequence , 24 of the mutations were missense , 11 resulted in frameshifts with premature truncation , 9 resulted in immediate truncation at the site of the mutation and 2 were frameshifts which extended the reading frame beyond the normal stop codon . Nine tumours had intronic variants , including substitution of invariant residues at splice sites , deletion of nucleotides spanning the exon-intron junction , an intronic variant of unknown function and the polymorphism c.463+43A>G . Four variants were identified which were present in genomic DNA but not in mRNA . Three of these , all encoding apparent missense changes to the primary amino acid sequence , were located close to the ends of exons , reduced the strength of the splice site and function as null rather than missense variants . One nonsense variant was not detectable in mRNA but all other mutations resulting in premature truncation codons ( PTCs ) were , suggesting truncating VHL mutations may potentially generate truncated VHL protein . An intronic variant , c.341\u201111T>A , previously regarded as of unknown function , is associated with an increased level of skipping of exon 2 and may , therefore , reduce production of pVHL . Our data show that the biological consequences of VHL mutations are not necessarily predictable from the sequence change of the mutation and that for the majority of VHL mutations , the potential for the generation of mutant protein exists .
Although interleukin-28A ( IL-28A ) is believed to have an antiviral effect , its role in tumor migration requires further examination . The present study was intended to verify the effect of IL-28A on the migration of UMUC-3 bladder cancer cells . IL-28A and its receptor IL-28AR1 mRNA were detected in UMUC-3 cells . Although exogenous IL-28A showed no effect on cell proliferation , a wound-healing migration assay showed that the migration of UMUC-3 cells was induced by IL-28A . Furthermore , treatment of the cells with IL-28A significantly promoted MMP-9 expression via binding activities of NF-kappaB and AP-1 . IL-28A also induced the activation of p38MAPK and Jak2-Stat2 signaling . Using the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and the dominant-negative plasmid DN-p38 , we found evidence that the inhibition of p38MAPK signaling suppressed the effects of IL-28A including wound-healing migration and MMP-9 expression by activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 binding in UMUC-3 cells . However , Jak-2 inhibition by AG490 did not affect IL-28A-induced migration of UMUC-3 cells . Collectively , we suggest for the first time that the p38MAPK pathway mediates IL-28A-induced cell migration through MMP-9 expression by activating NF-kappaB and AP-1 binding motifs .
Malaria parasites export ' a secretome ' of hundreds of proteins , including major virulence determinants , from their endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , past the parasite plasma and vacuolar membranes to the host erythrocyte . The export mechanism is high affinity ( nanomolar ) binding of a host ( cell ) targeting ( HT ) motif RxLxE/D/Q to the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate ( PI(3)P ) in the ER . Cleavage of the HT motif releases the secretory protein from the ER membrane . The HT motif is thought to be the only export signal resident in an N-terminal vacuolar translocation sequence ( VTS ) that quantitatively targets green fluorescent protein to the erythrocyte . We have previously shown that the R to A mutation in the HT motif , abrogates VTS binding to PI(3)P ( K(d)>5 \u03bcM ) . We now show that remarkably , the R to A mutant is exported to the host erythrocyte , for both membrane and soluble reporters , although the efficiency of export is reduced to of that seen with a complete VTS . Mass spectrometry indicates that the R to A mutant is cleaved at sites upstream of the HT motif . Antibodies to upstream sequences confirm that aberrantly cleaved R to A protein mutant is exported to the erythrocyte . These data suggest that export mechanisms , independent of PI(3)P as well as those dependent on PI(3)P , function together in a VTS to target parasite proteins to the host erythrocyte .
Chemoresistance represents a major obstacle to successful treatment for malignant glioma with temozolomide . N ( 7)-methyl-G and N ( 3)-methyl-A adducts comprise more than 80% of DNA lesions induced by temozolomide and are processed by the base excision repair , suggesting that the cellular resistance could be caused , in part , by this efficient repair pathway , although few studies have focused on this subject . The aim of this study was to evaluate the cellular responses to temozolomide treatment associated with methoxyamine ( blocker of base excision repair ) in glioblastoma cell lines , in order to test the hypothesis that the blockage of base excision repair pathway might sensitize glioblastoma cells to temozolomide . For all the tested cell lines , only T98G showed significant differences between temozolomide and temozolomide plus methoxyamine treatment , observed by reduced survival rates , enhanced the levels of DNA damage , and induced an arrest at G2-phase . In addition , of apoptotic cells ( sub-G1 fraction ) were observed at 48h . Western blot analysis demonstrated that APE1 and FEN1 presented a slightly reduced expression levels under the combined treatment , probably due to AP sites blockade by methoxyamine , thus causing a minor requirement of base excision repair pathway downstream to the AP removal by APE1 . On the other hand , PCNA expression in temozolomide plus methoxyamine-treated cells does not rule out the possibility that such alteration might be related to the blockage of cell cycle ( G2-phase ) , as observed at 24h of recovery time . The results obtained in the present study demonstrated the efficiency of methoxyamine to overcome glioblastoma resistance to temozolomide treatment .
Nonmelanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) is by far the most frequent type of cancer in humans . NMSC includes several types of malignancies with different clinical outcomes , the most frequent being basal and squamous cell carcinomas . We have used the Sleeping Beauty transposon/transposase system to identify somatic mutations associated with NMSC . Transgenic mice bearing multiple copies of a mutagenic Sleeping Beauty transposon T2Onc2 and expressing the SB11 transposase under the transcriptional control of regulatory elements from the keratin K5 promoter were treated with TPA , either in wild-type or Ha-ras mutated backgrounds . After several weeks of treatment , mice with transposition developed more malignant tumors with decreased latency compared with control mice . Transposon/transposase animals also developed basal cell carcinomas . Genetic analysis of the transposon integration sites in the tumors identified several genes recurrently mutated in different tumor samples , which may represent novel candidate cancer genes . We observed alterations in the expression levels of some of these genes in human tumors . Our results show that inactivating mutations in Notch1 and Nsd1 , among others , may have an important role in skin carcinogenesis .
A 34-year-old Japanese woman presented with left supraclavicular lymph node swelling . Computed tomography scans revealed a mass on the left lower lobe , pulmonary nodules , and pleural effusion . A lymph node biopsy revealed large-cell carcinoma with an epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) deletion mutation , L747-T751 in exon 19 . Although malignant pleural effusions carried the same EGFR mutation , progressive pleural effusions after treatment with chemotherapy , gefitinib , and erlotinib did not show any EGFR mutation . A cell line established from the pleural effusion 3 days before the patient expired also did not harbor the EGFR mutation . Histological sections of the lymph node of the patient were similar to those of the xenograft tumor of the cell line . There may be genetic heterogeneity in EGFR mutant tumors .
BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer is one of the main cancers in the Western world . About 90% of the deaths arise from formation of distant metastasis . The expression of the newly identified gene metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 ( MACC1 ) is a prognostic indicator for colon cancer metastasis . Here , we analyzed for the first time the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the coding region of MACC1 for clinical outcome of colorectal cancer patients . Additionally , we screened met proto-oncogene ( Met ) , the transcriptional target gene of MACC1 , for mutations . METHODS We sequenced the coding exons of MACC1 in 154 colorectal tumors ( stages I , II and III ) and the crucial exons of Met in 60 colorectal tumors ( stages I , II and III ) . We analyzed the association of MACC1 polymorphisms with clinical data , including metachronous metastasis , UICC stages , tumor invasion , lymph node metastasis and patients ' survival ( n = 154 , stages I , II and III ) . Furthermore , we performed biological assays in order to evaluate the functional impact of MACC1 SNPs on the motility of colorectal cancer cells . RESULTS We genotyped three MACC1 SNPs in the coding region . Thirteen % of the tumors had the genotype cg ( rs4721888 , L31V ) , 48% a ct genotype ( rs975263 , S515L ) and 84% a gc or cc genotype ( rs3735615 , R804T ) . We found no association of these SNPs with clinicopathological parameters or with patients ' survival , when analyzing the entire patients ' cohort . An increased risk for a shorter metastasis-free survival of patients with a ct genotype ( rs975263 ) was observed in younger colon cancer patients with stage I or II ( P = 0.041 , n = 18 ) . In cell culture , MACC1 SNPs did not affect MACC1-induced cell motility and proliferation . CONCLUSION In summary , the identification of coding MACC1 SNPs in primary colorectal tumors does not improve the prediction for metastasis formation or for patients ' survival compared to MACC1 expression analysis alone . The ct genotype ( rs975263 ) might be associated with a reduced survival for younger colon cancer patients in early stages . However , further studies with larger sample sizes are needed .
Liver cancer , predominantly hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , represents a complex and fatal malignancy driven primarily by oxidative stress and inflammation . Due to dismal prognosis and limited therapeutic intervention , chemoprevention has emerged as a viable approach to reduce the morbidity and mortality of HCC . Pomegranate fruit is a rich source of phytochemicals endowed with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties . We previously reported that pomegranate phytochemicals inhibit diethylnitrosamine ( DENA)-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis in rats though nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant mechanisms . Since Nrf2 also acts as a key mediator of the nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB)-regulated inflammatory pathway , our present study investigated the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of a pomegranate emulsion ( PE ) during DENA-induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis . Rats were administered with PE ( 1 or 10 g/kg ) 4 weeks before and 18 weeks following DENA initiation . There was a significant increase in hepatic expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase , 3-nitrotyrosine , heat shock protein 70 and 90 , cyclooxygenase-2 and NF-kappaB in DENA-exposed rat livers . PE dose-dependently suppressed all aforementioned elevated inflammatory markers . A conspicuous finding of this study involves lack of cardiotoxicity of PE as assessed by monitoring cardiac function using noninvasive echocardiography . Our results provide substantial evidence that suppression of the inflammatory cascade through modulation of NF-kappaB signaling pathway may represent a novel mechanism of liver tumor inhibitory effects of PE against experimental hepatocarcinogenesis . Data presented here coupled with those of our earlier study underline the importance of simultaneously targeting two interconnected molecular circuits , namely , Nrf2-mediated redox signaling and NF-kappaB-regulated inflammatory pathway , by pomegranate phytoconstituents to achieve chemoprevention of HCC .
Bioenergetic profiling of tumors is a new challenge of cancer research and medicine as therapies are currently being developed . Meanwhile , methodological means must be proposed to gather information on tumor metabolism in order to adapt these potential therapies to the bioenergetic specificities of tumors . Studies performed on tumors and cancer cell lines have shown that cancer cells bioenergetics is highly variable . This profile changes with microenvironmental conditions ( eg. substrate availability ) , the oncogenes activated ( and the tumor suppressors inactivated ) and the interaction with the stroma ( i.e. reverse Warburg effect ) . Here , we assessed the power of metabolic footprinting ( MFP ) to unravel the bioenergetics and associated anabolic changes induced by three oncogenes , c-Myc , KLF4 and Oct1 . The MFP approach provides a quantitative analysis of the metabolites secreted and consumed by cancer cells . We used ultra performance liquid chromatography for quantifying the amino acid uptake and secretion . To investigate the potential oncogene-mediated alterations in mitochondrial metabolism , we measured oxygen consumption rate and ATP production as well as the glucose uptake and lactate release . Our findings show that c-Myc deficiency initiates the Warburg effect along with a reduction of mitochondrial respiration . KLF4 deficiency also stimulated glycolysis , albeit without cellular respiration impairment . In contrast , Oct1 deficiency reduced glycolysis and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation efficiency . MFP revealed that c-Myc , KLF4 and Oct1 altered amino acid metabolism with specific patterns . We identified isoleucine , alpha-aminoadipic acid and GABA ( gamma-aminoisobutyric acid ) as biomarkers related . Our findings establish the impact of Oct1 , KLF4 and c-Myc on cancer bioenergetics and evidence a link between oncosecretomics and cellular bioenergetics profile .
Gene trapping is a method of inserting DNA into the genome at random , generating insertional mutations throughout the genome . The efficiency of retroviral gene trapping is not sufficient in part because of a strong preference for retroviral integration near transcription start sites . In contrast , lentiviral vectors strongly favor integration in the entire region of highly active genes , suggesting that lentiviral vectors would improve the efficiency of gene trapping . In this study , we constructed both lentiviral and retroviral gene-trap vectors and analyzed integration sites in mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells . The frequency of false-positive gene-trap events was about 12-fold higher for the retroviral vector compared to the lentiviral vector . Within intragenic regions , most of the retroviral vector integration sites were found in the 5 ' untranslated region , while the lentiviral vector integrated uniformly throughout transcriptional units . The trapping efficiency of unique genes was significantly higher for the lentiviral vector ( than for the retroviral vector ( Our data demonstrate that the lentiviral vector can trap the active genes more efficiently than the retroviral vector and will facilitate efficient generation of gene-trap libraries not only in ES cells but also in a wide variety of cell lines and primary cells .
Genetic defects in breast cancer ( BC ) susceptibility genes , most importantly BRCA1 and BRCA2 , account for of hereditary BC and ovarian cancer ( OC ) . Little is known about the contribution of constitutive ( soma-wide ) epimutations to the remaining cases . We developed bisulfite pyrosequencing assays to screen >600 affected BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation-negative patients from the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer for constitutive hypermethylation of ATM , BRCA1 , BRCA2 , RAD51C , PTEN and TP53 in blood cells . In a second step , patients with \u22656% promoter methylation were analyzed by bisulfite plasmid sequencing to demonstrate the presence of hypermethylated alleles ( epimutations ) , indicative of epigenetic gene silencing . Altogether we identified nine ( 1.4% ) patients with constitutive BRCA1 and three ( 0.5% ) with RAD51C hypermethylation . Epimutations were found in both sporadic cases , in particular in 2 ( 5.5% ) of 37 patients with early-onset BC , and familial cases , in particular 4 ( 10% ) of 39 patients with OC . Hypermethylation was always confined to one of the two parental alleles in a subset ( 12-40% ) of the analyzed cells . Because epimutations occurred in cell types from different embryonal layers , they most likely originated in single cells during early somatic development . We propose that analogous to germline genetic mutations constitutive epimutations may serve as the first hit of tumor development . Because the role of constitutive epimutations in cancer development is likely to be largely underestimated , future strategies for effective testing of susceptibility to BC and OC should include an epimutation screen .
Colorectal tumors are continuously exposed to an inflammatory environment , which together with mitogenic signals sustain several cancer hallmarks . Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF\u03baB ) is a major regulator of inflammation and variation in NF\u03baB-associated genes could potentially be used as biomarkers to identify patients with increased risk of colorectal cancer ( CRC ) development , and/or a rapidly progressing disease . In this study , 348 CRC cases and 806 randomly selected healthy individuals from southeastern Sweden were examined with regard to seven polymorphisms in NF\u03baB pathway-associated genes . Log-rank-tests and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis examined the association between the polymorphisms and CRC-specific survival , whereas chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis were used to test for associations between the polymorphisms and CRC susceptibility . Gene expression and loss of heterozygosity analyses of TNFAIP3 were carried out in a subset of tumors to assess its role as a tumor suppressor in CRC . Heterozygous and polymorphic TNFAIP3 ( rs6920220 ) , heterozygous NLRP3 ( Q705K ) and polymorphic NF\u03baB -94 ATTG ins/del genotypes were found to be associated with poorer survival in patients diagnosed with invasive CRC ( aHR = 5.2 , 95% CI : 2.5-10.9 , P < 0.001 ) . TNFAIP3 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in tumors compared with adjacent non-neoplastic mucosa ( P < 0.0001 ) and loss of heterozygosity of 6q23.3 ( TNFAIP3 ) was detected in 17% of cases , whereas only 2.5% of the investigated specimens displayed TNFAIP3 gene mutations . We propose that TNFAIP3 ( rs6920220 ) , NLRP3 ( Q705K ) and NF\u03baB -94 ATTG ins/del polymorphisms are associated with poor survival in patients with advanced CRC and may be used as prognostic markers . Experimental results indicate that TNFAIP3 may act as a tumor suppressor in CRC .
Interleukin-23 ( IL-23 ) plays an essential role in the mucosal immune system . It has been suggested that IL-23 is able to induce carcinogenesis as well as inflammation and a recent study revealed that IL-23R is expressed in colorectal carcinoma cells . However , neither the differences in the IL-23R expression among the patients nor the concrete functions of IL-23 in colorectal carcinoma cells have been revealed . The aim of the present study was to examine the characteristics of IL-23R expression in colorectal carcinoma and the direct effects of IL-23 on colorectal cancer cells . We examined the IL-23R expression in human colorectal cancer tissue samples by immunohistochemistry . Cell proliferation and invasion assays under IL-23 stimulation were performed using cultured cells derived from colorectal cancer . ELISA and real-time PCR were used to evaluate the transforming growth factor ( TGF)-beta production due to IL-23 stimulation . All of the TNM stage IV patients were positive for IL-23R . IL-23R expression in the carcinoma tissue was also relatively high at the deepest point of invasion in certain cases . The proliferative and invasive activities and/or TGF-beta production of DLD-1 cells increased by IL-23 stimulation , whereas no change was observed in the activities of MIP101 and KM12c cells . IL-23 directly enhanced the malignancy of the colon carcinoma cells . An autocrine mechanism via TGF-beta production may underlie these effects . IL-23 is therefore a potential target for cancer immunotherapy . However , the homogeneity in IL-23R expression and the effects of IL-23 on colorectal carcinoma cells should be considered .
Proton radiotherapy has gained more favor among oncologists as a treatment option for localized and deep-seated tumors . In addition , protons are a major constituent of the space radiation astronauts receive during space flights . The potential for these exposures to lead to , or enhance cancer risk has not been well studied . Our objective is to study the biological effects of low energy protons on epithelial cells and its propensity to enhance transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGFbeta1)-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , a process occurring during tumor progression and critical for invasion and metastasis . Non-transformed mink lung epithelial cells ( Mv1Lu ) and hTERT- immortalized human esophageal epithelial cells ( EPC ) were used in this study . EMT was identified by alterations in cell morphology , EMT-related gene expression changes determined using real-time PCR , and EMT changes in specific cellular markers detected by immunostaining and western blotting . Although TGFbeta1 treatment alone is able to induce EMT in both Mv1Lu and EPC cells , low energy protons ( 5 MeV ) at doses as low as 0.1 Gy can enhance TGFbeta1 induced EMT . Protons alone can also induce a mild induction of EMT . SD208 , a potent TGFbeta Receptor 1 ( TGFbetaR1 ) kinase inhibitor , can efficiently block TGFbeta1/Smad signaling and attenuate EMT induction . We suggest a model for EMT after proton irradiation in normal and cancerous tissue based on our results that showed that low and high doses of protons can sensitize normal human epithelial cells to mesenchymal transition , more prominently in the presence of TGFbeta1 , but also in the absence of TGFbeta1 .
BACKGROUND To investigate the dynamics of inter- and intratumoral molecular alterations during tumor progression in recurrent gliomas . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS To address intertumoral heterogeneity we investigated non-microdissected tumor tissue of 106 gliomas representing 51 recurrent tumors . To address intratumoral heterogeneity a set of 16 gliomas representing 7 tumor pairs with at least one recurrence , and 4 single mixed gliomas were investigated by microdissection of distinct oligodendroglial and astrocytic tumor components . All tumors and tumor components were analyzed for allelic loss of 1p/19q ( LOH 1p/19q ) , for TP53- mutations and for R132 mutations in the IDH1 gene . The investigation of non-microdissected tumor tissue revealed clonality in 75% ( 38/51 ) . Aberrant molecular alterations upon recurrence were detected in 25% ( 13/51). 64% ( 9/14 ) of these were novel and associated with tumor progression . Loss of previously detected alterations was observed in 36% ( 5/14 ) . One tumor pair ( 1/14 ; 7% ) was significant for both . Intratumoral clonality was detected in 57% ( 4/7 ) of the microdissected tumor pairs and in 75% ( 3/4 ) of single microdissected tumors. 43% ( 3/7 ) of tumor pairs and one single tumor ( 25% ) revealed intratumoral heterogeneity . While intratumoral heterogeneity affected both the TP53- mutational status and the LOH1p/19q status , all tumors with intratumoral heterogeneity shared the R132 IDH1- mutation as a common feature in both their microdissected components . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE The majority of recurrent gliomas are of monoclonal origin . However , the detection of divertive tumor cell clones in morphological distinct tumor components sharing IDH1- mutations as early event may provide insight into the tumorigenesis of true mixed gliomas .
Congenital cataract is a leading cause of visual impairment in children and brings approximately 10% of childhood blindness worldwide . Molecular analysis revealed loci to be associated with several phenotypes of childhood cataracts . Until now , more than 30 loci and 18 genes on different chromosomes have been associated with autosomal dominant congenital cataract ( ADCC ) . Here , we present a three-generation Italian family with a non syndromic ADCC . A linkage analysis carried out using HumanCytoSNP-12 DNA Analysis BeadChip led us to identify ten genomic regions virtually involved in the disease . All the genes located in these regions were scored for possible relationship with ADCC and , according to a strict clinical and genetic selection , 4 genes have been analyzed . A novel sequence variant was found in the CRYBB2 gene ( p.Ser143Phe ) . This variant affects a conserved aminoacid in the third Greek key motif of the protein , cosegregates with the disease phenotype in all affected individuals and is not present both in the unaffected family members and 100 healthy control subjects . Finally , we identified the first CRYBB2 mutation in an Italian family causing a clinical picture of ADCC .
The tumor suppressor gene p53 has been implicated in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and tumor metastasis by regulating microRNA ( miRNA ) expression . Here , we report that mutant p53 exerts oncogenic functions and promotes EMT in endometrial cancer ( EC ) by directly binding to the promoter of miR-130b ( a negative regulator of ZEB1 ) and inhibiting its transcription . We transduced p53 mutants into p53-null EC cells , profiled the miRNA expression by miRNA microarray and identified miR-130b as a potential target of mutant p53 . Ectopic expression of p53 mutants repressed the expression of miR-130b and triggered ZEB1-dependent EMT and cancer cell invasion . Loss of an endogenous p53 mutation increased the expression of miR-130b , which resulted in reduced ZEB1 expression and attenuation of the EMT phenotype . Furthermore , re-expression of miR-130b suppressed mutant p53-induced EMT and ZEB1 expression . Importantly , the expression of miR-130 was significantly reduced in EC tissues , and patients with higher expression levels of miR-130b survived longer . These data provide a novel understanding of the roles of p53 gain-of-function mutations in accelerating tumor progression and metastasis through modulation of the miR-130b-ZEB1 axis .
BACKGROUND Flat adenomas are a subgroup of colorectal adenomas that have been associated with a distinct biology and a more aggressive clinical behavior compared to their polypoid counterparts . In the present study , we aimed to compare the mutation spectrum of 14 cancer genes , between these two phenotypes . METHODS A consecutive series of 106 flat and 93 polypoid adenomas was analyzed retrospectively for frequently occurring mutations in " hot spot " regions of KRAS , BRAF , PIK3CA and NRAS , as well as selected mutations in CTNNB1 ( \u03b2-catenin ) , EGFR , FBXW7 ( CDC4 ) , PTEN , STK11 , MAP2K4 , SMAD4 , PIK3R1 and PDGFRA using a high-throughput genotyping technique . Additionally , APC was analyzed using direct sequencing . RESULTS APC mutations were more frequent in polypoid adenomas compared to flat adenomas ( 48.5% versus 30.3% , respectively , p\u200a=\u200a0.02 ) . Mutations in KRAS , BRAF , NRAS , FBXW7 and CTNNB1 showed similar frequencies in both phenotypes . Between the different subtypes of flat adenomas ( 0-IIa , LST-F and LST-G ) no differences were observed for any of the investigated genes . CONCLUSION The lower APC mutation rate in flat adenomas compared to polypoid adenomas suggests that disruption of the Wnt-pathway may occur via different mechanisms in these two phenotypes . Furthermore , in contrast to previous observations our results in this large well-defined sample set indicate that there is no significant association between the different morphological phenotypes and mutations in key genes of the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway .
Gene therapy vectors based on the adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) are extremely efficient for gene transfer into post-mitotic cells of heart , muscle , brain , and retina . The reason for their exquisite tropism for these cells has long remained elusive . Here , we show that upon terminal differentiation , cardiac and skeletal myocytes downregulate proteins of the DNA damage response ( DDR ) and that this markedly induces permissivity to AAV transduction . We observed that expression of members of the MRN complex ( Mre11 , Rad50 , Nbs1 ) , which bind the incoming AAV genomes , faded in cardiomyocytes at weeks after birth , as well as upon myoblast differentiation in vitro ; in both cases , withdrawal of the cells from the cell cycle coincided with increased AAV permissivity . Treatment of proliferating cells with short-interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) against the MRN proteins , or with microRNA-24 , which is normally upregulated upon terminal differentiation and negatively controls the Nbs1 levels , significantly increased permissivity to AAV transduction . Consistently , delivery of these small RNAs to the juvenile liver concomitant with AAV markedly improved in vivo hepatocyte transduction . Collectively , these findings support the conclusion that cellular DDR proteins inhibit AAV transduction and that terminal cell differentiation relieves this restriction .
Metastatic cancer is extremely difficult to treat , and the presence of metastases greatly reduces a cancer patient's likelihood of long-term survival . The ZEB1 transcriptional repressor promotes metastasis through downregulation of microRNAs ( miRs ) that are strong inducers of epithelial differentiation and inhibitors of stem cell factors . Given that each miR can target multiple genes with diverse functions , we posited that the prometastatic network controlled by ZEB1 extends beyond these processes . We tested this hypothesis using a mouse model of human lung adenocarcinoma metastasis driven by ZEB1 , human lung carcinoma cells , and human breast carcinoma cells . Transcriptional profiling studies revealed that ZEB1 controls the expression of numerous oncogenic and tumor-suppressive miRs , including miR-34a . Ectopic expression of miR-34a decreased tumor cell invasion and metastasis , inhibited the formation of promigratory cytoskeletal structures , suppressed activation of the RHO GTPase family , and regulated a gene expression signature enriched in cytoskeletal functions and predictive of outcome in human lung adenocarcinomas . We identified several miR-34a target genes , including Arhgap1 , which encodes a RHO GTPase activating protein that was required for tumor cell invasion . These findings demonstrate that ZEB1 drives prometastatic actin cytoskeletal remodeling by downregulating miR-34a expression and provide a compelling rationale to develop miR-34a as a therapeutic agent in lung cancer patients .
The cellobiose- and cellulose-responsive induction of the FIII-avicelase ( cbhI ) , FII-carboxymethyl cellulase ( cmc2 ) , and FIa-xylanase ( xynIa ) genes is not regulated by XlnR in Aspergillus aculeatus , which suggests that this fungus possesses an unknown cellulase gene-activating pathway . To identify the regulatory factors involved in this pathway , we constructed a random insertional mutagenesis library using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of A. aculeatus NCP2 , which harbors a transcriptional fusion between the cbhI promoter ( P ( CBHI ) ) and the orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase gene ( pyrG ) . Of the transformants screened , one 5-FOA-resistant transformant , S4-22 , grew poorly on cellulose-containing media and exhibited reduced cellobiose-induced expression of cbhI . Southern blot analysis and nucleotide sequencing of the flanking regions of the T-DNA inserted in S4-22 indicated that the T-DNA was inserted within the coding region of a previously unreported Zn(II)(2)Cys(6)-transcription factor , which we designated the cellobiose response regulator ( ClbR ) . The disruption of the clbR gene resulted in a significant reduction in the expression of cbhI and cmc2 in response to cellobiose and cellulose . Interestingly , the cellulose-responsive induction of FI-carboxymethyl cellulase ( cmc1 ) and FIb-xylanase ( xynIb ) genes that are under the control of XlnR , was also reduced in the clbR-deficient mutant , but there was no effect on the induction of these genes in response to D-xylose or L-arabinose . These data demonstrate that ClbR participates in both XlnR-dependent and XlnR-independent cellobiose- and cellulose-responsive induction signaling pathways in A. aculeatus .
Identifying genomic alterations driving breast cancer is complicated by tumor diversity and genetic heterogeneity . Relevant mouse models are powerful for untangling this problem because such heterogeneity can be controlled . Inbred Chaos3 mice exhibit high levels of genomic instability leading to mammary tumors that have tumor gene expression profiles closely resembling mature human mammary luminal cell signatures . We genomically characterized mammary adenocarcinomas from these mice to identify cancer-causing genomic events that overlap common alterations in human breast cancer . Chaos3 tumors underwent recurrent copy number alterations ( CNAs ) , particularly deletion of the RAS inhibitor Neurofibromin 1 ( Nf1 ) in nearly all cases . These overlap with human CNAs including NF1 , which is deleted or mutated in 27.7% of all breast carcinomas . Chaos3 mammary tumor cells exhibit RAS hyperactivation and increased sensitivity to RAS pathway inhibitors . These results indicate that spontaneous NF1 loss can drive breast cancer . This should be informative for treatment of the significant fraction of patients whose tumors bear NF1 mutations .
Several basic leucine zipper ( B-ZIP ) transcription factors have been implicated in cancer , substance abuse , and other pathological conditions . We previously identified arylstibonic acids that bind to B-ZIP proteins and inhibit their interaction with DNA . In this study , we used electrophoretic mobility shift assay to analyze 46 arylstibonic acids for their activity to disrupt the DNA binding of three B-ZIP [ CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b1 , cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein ( CREB ) , and vitellogenin gene-binding protein ( VBP) ] and two basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper ( B-HLH-ZIP ) [ USF ( upstream stimulating factor ) and Mitf ] proteins . Twenty-five arylstibonic acids showed activity at micromolar concentrations . The most active compound , P6981 [ 2-(3-stibonophenyl)malonic acid ] , had half-maximal inhibition at nM for CREB . Circular dichroism thermal denaturation studies indicated that P6981 binds both the B-ZIP domain and the leucine zipper . The crystal structure of an arylstibonic acid , NSC13778 , bound to the VBP leucine zipper identified electrostatic interactions between both the stibonic and carboxylic acid groups of NSC13778 [ (E)-3-(3-stibonophenyl)acrylic acid ] and arginine side chains of VBP , which is also involved in interhelical salt bridges in the leucine zipper . P6981 induced GFP-B-ZIP chimeric proteins to partially localize to the cytoplasm , demonstrating that it is active in cells . P6981 inhibited the growth of a patient-derived clear cell sarcoma cell line whose oncogenic potential is driven by a chimeric protein EWS-ATF1 ( Ewing's sarcoma protein-activating transcription factor 1 ) , which contains the DNA binding domain of ATF1 , a B-ZIP protein . NSC13778 inhibited the growth of xenografted clear cell sarcoma , and no toxicity was observed . These experiments suggest that antimony containing arylstibonic acids are promising leads for suppression of DNA binding activities of B-ZIP and B-HLH-ZIP transcription factors .
Next-generation DNA sequencing promises to revolutionize clinical medicine and basic research . However , while this technology has the capacity to generate hundreds of billions of nucleotides of DNA sequence in a single experiment , the error rate of results in hundreds of millions of sequencing mistakes . These scattered errors can be tolerated in some applications but become extremely problematic when " deep sequencing " genetically heterogeneous mixtures , such as tumors or mixed microbial populations . To overcome limitations in sequencing accuracy , we have developed a method termed Duplex Sequencing . This approach greatly reduces errors by independently tagging and sequencing each of the two strands of a DNA duplex . As the two strands are complementary , true mutations are found at the same position in both strands . In contrast , PCR or sequencing errors result in mutations in only one strand and can thus be discounted as technical error . We determine that Duplex Sequencing has a theoretical background error rate of less than one artifactual mutation per billion nucleotides sequenced . In addition , we establish that detection of mutations present in only one of the two strands of duplex DNA can be used to identify sites of DNA damage . We apply the method to directly assess the frequency and pattern of random mutations in mitochondrial DNA from human cells .
BACKGROUND Greying with age in horses is an autosomal dominant trait , associated with loss of hair pigmentation , melanoma and vitiligo-like depigmentation . We recently identified a 4.6 kb duplication in STX17 to be associated with the phenotype . The aims of this study were to investigate if the duplication in Grey horses shows copy number variation and to exclude that any other polymorphism is uniquely associated with the Grey mutation . RESULTS We found little evidence for copy number expansion of the duplicated sequence in blood DNA from Grey horses . In contrast , clear evidence for copy number expansions was indicated in five out of eight tested melanoma tissues or melanoma cell lines . A tendency of a higher copy number in aggressive tumours was also found . Massively parallel resequencing of the kb Grey haplotype did not reveal any additional mutations perfectly associated with the phenotype , confirming the duplication as the true causative mutation . We identified three SNP alleles that were present in a subset of Grey haplotypes within the 350 kb region that shows complete linkage disequilibrium with the causative mutation . Thus , these three nucleotide substitutions must have occurred subsequent to the duplication , consistent with our interpretation that the Grey mutation arose more than 2,000 years before present . CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the mutation acts as a melanoma-driving regulatory element . The elucidation of the mechanistic features of the duplication will be of considerable interest for the characterization of these horse melanomas as well as for the field of human melanoma research .
The metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 , MALAT1 , is a long non-coding RNA ( lncRNA ) that has been discovered as a marker for lung cancer metastasis . It is highly abundant , its expression is strongly regulated in many tumor entities including lung adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma as well as physiological processes , and it is associated with many RNA binding proteins and highly conserved throughout evolution . The nuclear transcript MALAT-1 has been functionally associated with gene regulation and alternative splicing and its regulation has been shown to impact proliferation , apoptosis , migration and invasion . Here , we have developed a human and a mouse knockout system to study the loss-of-function phenotypes of this important ncRNA . In human tumor cells , MALAT1 expression was abrogated using Zinc Finger Nucleases . Unexpectedly , the quantitative loss of MALAT1 did neither affect proliferation nor cell cycle progression nor nuclear architecture in human lung or liver cancer cells . Moreover , genetic loss of Malat1 in a knockout mouse model did not give rise to any obvious phenotype or histological abnormalities in Malat1-null compared with wild-type animals . Thus , loss of the abundant nuclear long ncRNA MALAT1 is compatible with cell viability and normal development .
FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ( FLT3 ) normally functions in the survival/proliferation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells , but its constitutive activation by internal tandem duplication ( ITD ) mutations correlates with a poor prognosis in AML . The development of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKI ) is a promising strategy , but resistance that arises during the course of treatment caused by secondary mutations within the mutated gene itself poses a significant challenge . In an effort to predict FLT3 resistance mutations that might develop in patients , we used saturation mutagenesis of FLT3/ITD followed by selection of transfected cells in FLT3 TKI . We identified F621L , A627P , F691L and Y842C mutations in FLT3/ITD that confer varying levels of resistance to FLT3 TKI . Western blotting confirmed that some FLT3 TKI were ineffective at inhibiting FLT3 autophosphorylation and signaling through MAP kinase , STAT5 and AKT in some mutants . Balb/c mice transplanted with the FLT3/ITD Y842C mutation confirmed resistance to sorafenib in vivo but not to lestaurtinib . These results indicate a growing number of FLT3 mutations that are likely to be encountered in patients . Such knowledge , combined with known remaining sensitivity to other FLT3 TKI , will be important to establish as secondary drug treatments that can be substituted when these mutants are encountered .
Increasing evidence shows that estrogens are involved in lung cancer proliferation and progression , and most human lung tumors express estrogen receptor beta ( ERbeta ) as well as aromatase . To determine if the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole prevents development of lung tumors induced by a tobacco carcinogen , alone or in combination with the ER antagonist fulvestrant , ovariectomized female mice received treatments with the tobacco carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosoamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone ( NNK ) along with daily supplements of androstenedione , the substrate for aromatase . Placebo , anastrozole and/or fulvestrant were administered in both an initiation and a promotion protocol of lung tumorigenesis . The combination of fulvestrant and anastrozole given during NNK exposure resulted in significantly fewer NNK-induced lung tumors ( mean = 0.5 ) compared with placebo ( mean = 4.6 , P < 0.001 ) , fulvestrant alone ( mean = 3.4 , P < 0.001 ) or anastrozole alone ( mean = 2.8 , P = 0.002 ) . A significantly lower Ki67 cell proliferation index was also observed compared with single agent and control treatment groups . Beginning antiestrogen treatment after NNK exposure , when preneoplastic lesions had already formed , also yielded maximum antitumor effects with the combination . Aromatase expression was found mainly in macrophages infiltrating preneoplastic and tumorous areas of the lungs , whereas ERbeta was found in both macrophages and tumor cells . Antiestrogens , especially in combination , effectively inhibited tobacco carcinogen-induced murine lung tumorigenesis and may have application for lung cancer prevention . An important source of estrogen synthesis may be inflammatory cells that infiltrate the lungs in response to carcinogens , beginning early in the carcinogenesis process . ERbeta expressed by inflammatory and neoplastic epithelial cells in the lung may signal in response to local estrogen production .
A glycolytic profile unifies a group of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas ( PHEOs/PGLs ) with distinct underlying gene defects , including von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) and succinate dehydrogenase B ( SDHB ) mutations . Nevertheless , their tumor aggressiveness is distinct : PHEOs/PGLs metastasize rarely in VHL- , but frequently in SDHB-patients . To date , the molecular mechanisms causing the more aggressive phenotype in SDHB-PHEOs/PGLs remain largely unknown . Recently , however , an excellent model to study aggressive PHEOs ( mouse tumor tissue ( MTT ) cells ) has been developed from mouse PHEO cells ( MPC ) . We employed this model for a proteomics based approach to identify changes characteristic for tumor aggressiveness , which we then explored in a homogeneous set of human SDHB- and VHL-PHEOs/PGLs . The increase of glucose transporter 1 in VHL , and of hexokinase 2 in VHL and SDHB , confirmed their glycolytic profile . In agreement with the cell model and in support of decoupling of glycolysis , the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) , SDHB tumors showed increased lactate dehydrogenase levels . In SDHB-PGLs OXPHOS complex activity was increased at complex III and , as expected , decreased at complex II . Moreover , protein and mRNA expression of all tested OXPHOS-related genes were higher in SDHB- than in VHL-derived tumors . Although there was no direct evidence for increased reactive oxygen species production , elevated superoxide dismutase 2 expression may reflect elevated oxidative stress in SDHB-derived PHEOs/PGLs . For the first time , we show that despite dysfunction in complex II and evidence for a glycolytic phenotype , the Warburg effect does not seem to fully apply to SDHB-PHEOs/PGLs with respect to decreased OXPHOS . In addition , we present evidence for increased LDHA and SOD2 expression in SDHB-PHEOs/PGLs , proteins that have been proposed as promising therapeutic targets in other cancers . This study provides new insight into pathogenic mechanisms in aggressive human PHEOs/PGLs , which may lead to identifying new diagnostic and prognostic markers in the near future .
Patients on hemodialysis ( HD ) who undergo lung resection represent a high risk group requiring a careful perioperative management . To access a cardiac risk of HD patients a complete cardiac examination must be conducted preoperatively . The patients should undergo sufficient courses of HD to ameliorate electrolyte imbalance and volume disturbance before surgery . An elective operation should be scheduled on the day after HD . During operation , gentle operative maneuver and complete hemostatic technique are required to reduce a risk of postoperative bleeding . An adequate amount of antibiotics should be administrated to avoid a surgical site infection . Pulmonary edema due to volume overload and hyperkalemia are the most dangerous postoperative complications . Infusion should be conducted with potassium-free solution at 20 ml/h until the restart of HD . HD could be safely performed with nafamostat mesilate on the day after operation in most patients . If hyperkalemia and pulmonary edema are resistant to conservative managements , an emergency HD is required . Prognosis after lung resection for lung cancer patients on HD is not satisfactory . Many patients die of non cancer related causes such as heart failure and infection . Long term management of the underlying renal condition is necessary to improve their postoperative survival .
The generation and detection of mechanical forces is a ubiquitous aspect of cell physiology , with direct relevance to cancer metastasis(1) , atherogenesis(2) and wound healing(3) . In each of these examples , cells both exert force on their surroundings and simultaneously enzymatically remodel the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . The effect of forces on ECM has thus become an area of considerable interest due to its likely biological and medical importance(4-7) . Single molecule techniques such as optical trapping(8) , atomic force microscopy(9) , and magnetic tweezers(10,11) allow researchers to probe the function of enzymes at a molecular level by exerting forces on individual proteins . Of these techniques , magnetic tweezers ( MT ) are notable for their low cost and high throughput . MT exert forces in the range of pN and can provide millisecond temporal resolution , qualities that are well matched to the study of enzyme mechanism at the single-molecule level(12) . Here we report a highly parallelizable MT assay to study the effect of force on the proteolysis of single protein molecules . We present the specific example of the proteolysis of a trimeric collagen peptide by matrix metalloproteinase 1 ( MMP-1 ) ; however , this assay can be easily adapted to study other substrates and proteases .
Mechanosensitive channels sense elevated membrane tension that arises from rapid water influx occurring when cells move from high to low osmolarity environments ( hypoosmotic shock ) . These non-specific channels in the cytoplasmic membrane release osmotically-active solutes and ions . The two major mechanosensitive channels in Escherichia coli are MscL and MscS . Deletion of both proteins severely compromises survival of hypoosmotic shock . However , like many bacteria , E. coli cells possess other MscS-type genes ( kefA , ybdG , ybiO , yjeP and ynaI ) . Two homologs , MscK ( kefA ) and YbdG , have been characterized as mechanosensitive channels that play minor roles in maintaining cell integrity . Additional channel openings are occasionally observed in patches derived from mutants lacking MscS , MscK and MscL . Due to their rare occurrence , little is known about these extra pressure-induced currents or their genetic origins . Here we complete the identification of the remaining E. coli mechanosensitive channels YnaI , YbiO and YjeP . The latter is the major component of the previously described MscM activity ( pS ) , while YnaI ( pS ) and YbiO ( pS ) were previously unknown . Expression of native YbiO is NaCl-specific and RpoS-dependent . A \u03947 strain was created with all seven E. coli mechanosensitive channel genes deleted . High level expression of YnaI , YbiO or YjeP proteins from a multicopy plasmid in the \u03947 strain ( MJFGH ) leads to substantial protection against hypoosmotic shock . Purified homologs exhibit high molecular masses that are consistent with heptameric assemblies . This work reveals novel mechanosensitive channels and discusses the regulation of their expression in the context of possible additional functions .
Mouse models of Alzheimer disease ( AD ) have been generated based on Amyloid-\u03b2 Precursor Protein ( A\u03b2PP ) and the Presenilin ( PSEN ) gene mutations associated with familial AD ( FAD ) . Such models have provided valuable insights into AD pathogenesis and represent an important research tool for the discovery of potential treatments . To model amyloid deposition in AD , we generated a new mouse line based on the presence of two copies of the genomic region encoding human wild-type A\u03b2PP as well as a mutation ( L166P ) in the murine Psen1 . By months of age , these mice have begun to develop cerebral A\u03b2 pathology with a significant increase in the levels of A\u03b2PP C-terminal fragments and A\u03b242 , as well as increase A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio . Since in the brain and other tissues of these mice , wild-type human A\u03b2PP mRNA and protein levels are comparable to those of endogenous A\u03b2PP , this model may allow studies about the role of A\u03b2PP isoforms in the pathogenesis of AD . This animal model may be suitable to test drugs aimed at inhibiting expression or altering splicing and processing of A\u03b2PP , without artifacts associated with the presence of mutations in A\u03b2PP or overexpression due to the use of exogenous promoters . These features of the new model are of critical importance in assessing the success of therapeutic interventions .
PURPOSE To characterize the clinical features of a Chinese Uygur pedigree with primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) and to identify mutations in two candidate genes , trabecular meshwork inducible glucocorticoid response ( MYOC/TIGR ) and human dioxin-inducible cytochrome P450 ( CYP1B1 ) . METHODS Twenty one members from a Chinese Uygur family of four generations were included in the study . All participants underwent complete ophthalmologic examinations . Five were diagnosed as POAG , four as glaucoma suspects , and the rest were asymptomatic . Molecular genetic analysis was performed on all subjects included in the study . All exons of CYP1B1 and MYOC were amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , sequenced and compared with a reference database . The variations detected were evaluated in available family members as well as 102 normal controls . Possible changes in structure and function of the protein induced by amino acid variance were predicted by bioinformatics analysis . RESULTS Elevated intraocular pressure and late-stage glaucomatous cupping of the optic disc were found in five patients of this family . A novel heterozygous missense mutation c.1151 A>G in exon 3 of MYOC was found in all five patients diagnosed as POAG and four glaucoma suspects , but not in the rest of the family members and 102 normal controls . This mutation caused an amino acid substitution of aspartic acid to glycine at position 384 ( p . D384G ) of the MYOC protein . This substitution may cause structural and functional changes of the protein based on bioinformatics analysis . No mutations were found in CYP1B1 . CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that the novel mutation D384G of MYOC is likely responsible for the pathogenesis of POAG in this pedigree .
Focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) is an important mediator of extracellular matrix integrin signaling , cell motility , cell proliferation and cell survival . Increased FAK expression is observed in a variety of solid human tumors and increased FAK expression and activity frequently correlate with metastatic disease and poor prognosis . Herein we identify miR-7 as a direct regulator of FAK expression. miR-7 expression is decreased in malignant versus normal breast tissue and its expression correlates inversely with metastasis in human breast cancer patients . Forced expression of miR-7 produced increased E-CADHERIN and decreased FIBRONECTIN and VIMENTIN expression in breast cancer cells . The levels of miR-7 expression was positively correlated with E-CADHERIN mRNA and negatively correlated with VIMENTIN mRNA levels in breast cancer samples . Forced expression of miR-7 in aggressive breast cancer cell lines suppressed tumor cell monolayer proliferation , anchorage independent growth , three-dimensional growth in Matrigel , migration and invasion . Conversely , inhibition of miR-7 in the HBL-100 mammary epithelial cell line promoted cell proliferation and anchorage independent growth . Rescue of FAK expression reversed miR-7 suppression of migration and invasion. miR-7 also inhibited primary breast tumor development , local invasion and metastatic colonization of breast cancer xenografts . Thus , miR-7 expression is decreased in metastatic breast cancer , correlates with the level of epithelial differentiation of the tumor and inhibits metastatic progression .
Ruthenium complexes hold great potential as alternatives to cisplatin in cancer chemotherapy . We present results on the in vitro antitumor activity of an organometallic ' Ru(II)Cp ' complex , [ Ru(II)Cp(bipy)(PPh(3))][CF(3)SO(3) ] , designated as TM34 ( PPh(3) = triphenylphosphine ; bipy = 2,2'-bipyridine ) , against a panel of human tumor cell lines with different responses to cisplatin treatment , namely ovarian ( A2780/A2780cisR , cisplatin sensitive and resistant , respectively ) , breast ( MCF7 ) and prostate ( PC3 ) adenocarcinomas . TM34 is very active against all tumorigenic cell lines , its efficacy largely surpassing that of cisplatin ( CisPt ) . The high activity of TM34 towards CisPt resistant cell lines possibly suggests a mechanism of action distinct from that of CisPt . The effect of TM34 on the activity of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 ( PARP-1 ) involved in DNA repair mechanisms and apoptotic pathways was also evaluated , and it was found to be a strong PARP-1 ruthenium inhibitor in the low micromolar range ( IC(50)=1.0 +/- 0.3 \u03bcM ) . TM34 quickly binds to human serum albumin forming a 1:1 complex with a conditional stability constant ( log K ' comparable to that of the Ru(III) complex in clinical trial KP1019 . This indicates that TM34 can be efficiently transported by this protein , possibly being involved in its distribution and delivery if the complex is introduced in the blood stream . Albumin binding does not affect TM34 activity , yielding an adduct that maintains cytotoxic properties ( against A2780 and A2780cisR cells ) . Altogether , the properties herein evaluated suggest that TM34 could be an anticancer agent of highly relevant therapeutic value .
DYT1 is caused by a partly penetrant dominant mutation in TOR1A that leads to a glutamic acid deletion ( \u0394E ) in torsinA . Identifying environmental factors that modulate disease pathogenesis and penetrance could help design therapeutic strategies for dystonia . Several cell-based studies suggest that expression of torsinA(\u0394E) increases the susceptibility of neuronal cells to challenges to their oxidative/energy metabolism . Based on those reports , we hypothesized that mice expressing torsinA(\u0394E) would be more susceptible than control littermates to the effects of oxidative stress and ATP deficits caused by disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in neurons . To test this hypothesis , we administered 20 or 50 mg/kg/day of the irreversible complex-II inhibitor 3-nitropropionic acid ( 3-NP ) intraperitoneally for 15 consecutive days to young heterozygote DYT1 knock-in ( KI ) mice and wild type littermates . Repeated phenotypic assessments were performed at baseline , during and after the injections . Animals were then sacrificed and their brains processed for protein analysis . The administration of 20 mg/kg 3-NP led to increased levels of torsinA in the striatum , the main target of 3-NP , but did not cause motor dysfunction in DYT1 KI or control mice . The administration of 50 mg/kg/day of 3-NP caused the death of of wild type animals . Interestingly , DYT1 KI animals showed significantly reduced mortality . Surviving animals exhibited abnormal motor behavior during and right after the injection period , but recovered by 4 weeks postinjection independent of genotype . In contrast to the findings reported in cultured cells , these studies suggest the DYT1 mutation does not sensitize central neurons against the toxic effects of oxidative stress and energy deficits .
OBJECTIVES Lymph node metastasis is among the most important prognostic factors for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after curative esophagectomy ; however , the extent of lymphadenectomy is still controversial . The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency of lymphatic metastases and to study the pattern of lymph node metastasis in a large study population . METHODS The data from 1361 patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent curative R0 esophagectomy were retrospectively examined . Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with lymph node metastasis . RESULTS Of the 1361 patients , 714 ( 52.5% ) were found to have lymph node metastasis . The frequency of lymph node metastasis increased as the tumor invasion increased . Paratracheal nodes were the most frequent metastasis nodes ( 15.9% ) . The frequency of lymph node metastasis was 9.8% in the neck , 18.0% in the upper mediastinum , 18.9% in the middle mediastinum , 11.8% in the lower mediastinum , and 28.4% in the abdomen . Of these 714 patients , 424 ( 31.2% ) presented with 1 field involvement , 255 ( 18.7% ) with 2 fields , and 35 ( 2.6% ) with 3 fields involvement . Logistic regression analysis revealed tumor length ( P<.001 ) , tumor invasion ( P<.001 ) , tumor differentiation ( P=.003 ) , and lymphovascular invasion ( P<.001 ) were risk factors for lymph node metastasis . Tumor location ( P<.001 ) , tumor invasion ( P=.003 ) , lymphovascular invasion ( P=.004 ) , and paratracheal lymph node involvement ( P=.002 ) were identified as risk factors for cervical lymph node metastasis . CONCLUSIONS Metastases were more frequent in the abdomen than in the neck . Total mediastinal and upper abdominal lymphadenectomy should be carefully conducted . Certain factors , such as tumor location , depth of tumor invasion , lymphovascular invasion , and paratracheal lymph node involvement , might be helpful in determining the need to perform cervical lymphadenectomy in individual patients .
MDSCs and Tregs play an essential role in the immunosuppressive networks that contribute to tumor-immune evasion . The mechanisms by which tumors promote the expansion and/or function of these suppressive cells and the cross-talk between MDSC and Treg remain incompletely defined . Previous reports have suggested that MDSC may contribute to Treg induction in cancer . Herein , we provide evidence that tumor-induced gr-MDSCs , endowed with the potential of suppressing conventional T Lc , surprisingly impair TGF-beta1-mediated generation of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) iTregs . Furthermore , gr-MDSCs impede the proliferation of nTregs without , however , affecting FoxP3 expression . Suppression of iTreg differentiation from na<FFFD>ve CD4(+) cells by gr-MDSC occurs early in the polarization process , requires inhibition of early T cell activation , and depends on ROS and IDO but does not require arginase 1 , iNOS , NO , cystine/cysteine depletion , PD-1 and PD-L1 signaling , or COX-2 . These findings thus indicate that gr-MDSCs from TB hosts have the unanticipated ability to restrict immunosuppressive Tregs .
The human asparaginase-like protein 1 ( hASRGL1 ) catalyzes the hydrolysis of l-asparagine and isoaspartyl-dipeptides . As an N-terminal nucleophile ( Ntn ) hydrolase superfamily member , the active form of hASRGL1 is generated by an intramolecular cleavage step with Thr168 as the catalytic residue . However , in vitro , autoprocessing is incomplete ( fettering the biophysical characterization of hASRGL1 . We circumvented this obstacle by constructing a circularly permuted hASRGL1 that uncoupled the autoprocessing reaction , allowing us to kinetically and structurally characterize this enzyme and the precursor-like hASRGL1-Thr168Ala variant . Crystallographic and biochemical evidence suggest an activation mechanism where a torsional restraint on the Thr168 side chain helps drive the intramolecular processing reaction . Cleavage and formation of the active site releases the torsional restriction on Thr168 , which is facilitated by a small conserved Gly-rich loop near the active site that allows the conformational changes necessary for activation .
BACKGROUND Cholangiocarcinoma , a type of malignant tumor , originates from epithelial cells of the bile duct . Perineural invasion is common path for cholangiocarcinoma metastasis , and it is highly correlated with postoperative recurrence and poor prognosis . It has been reported that muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 ( mAChR M3 ) is widely expressed in digestive tract cancer , and may play an important role in the proliferation , differentiation , transformation and carcinogenesis of tumors . This study was to explore the effect of mAChR M3 on the growth of cholangiocarcinoma cells in vitro and provide a new approach to the pathogenesis and treatment of cholangiocarcinoma . METHODS Streptavidin-biotin complex immunohistochemistry was carried out to assess the expression of mAChR M3 in surgical specimens of cholangiocarcinomas ( 40 cases ) and normal bile duct tissues ( 9 ) , as well as to investigate nerve infiltration . The cholangiocarcinoma cells were treated with different concentrations of selective M-receptor agonist pilocarpine and M-receptor blocker atropine sulfate to induce changes in cell proliferation . The experimental data were analyzed by the Chi-square test . RESULTS The strongly-positive expression rate of mAChR M3 was much higher in poorly-differentiated ( 69% , 9/13 ) than in well- and moderately-differentiated cholangiocarcinomas ( 30% , 8/27 ) ( X2=5.631 , P<0.05 ) . The strongly-positive mAChR M3 expression rate in hilar cholangiocarcinoma ( 50% , 14/28 ) was higher than that in cholangiocarcinomas from the middle and lower common bile duct ( 25% , 3/12 ) ( X2=2.148 , P<0.05 ) . Cholangiocarcinomas with distant metastasis had a strongly-positive expression rate ( 75% , 9/12 ) , which was much higher than those without distant metastasis ( 29% , 8/28 ) ( X2=7.410 , P<0.01 ) . The absorbance value in the pilocarpine+atropine group was significantly higher than the corresponding value in the pilocarpine group . CONCLUSIONS The expression of mAChR M3 is influenced by the extent of differentiation , distant metastasis and the site of cholangiocarcinoma . It also plays a key role in the proliferation and metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma .
Colorectal cancer represents one of the most challenging diseases . Increasing evidence indicates that aberrant expression of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) is related to pathogenesis of colorectal cancer . Cancer cells reprogram metabolic pathways to sustain higher proliferation rates . Whether mechanisms underlying the role of miRNA in colorectal cancer are involved in metabolic reprogramming and the mechanisms through which miRNAs alter cancer metabolism are as yet unknown . Herein , we show that miR-124 , miR-137 and miR-340 are associated with poor prognosis of colorectal cancer . Expression of these miRNAs inhibits the growth of colorectal cancer cells . PKM ( pyruvate kinase isozyme ) alternative splicing proteins ( PTB1/hnRNAPA1/hnRNAPA2 ) , which control the inclusion of exon 9 ( PKM1 ) or exon 10 ( PKM2 ) , are targeted by miR-124 , miR-137 and miR-340 . Consequently , miR-124 , miR-137 and miR-340 switch PKM gene expression from PKM2 to PKM1 . High ratios of PKM1/PKM2 inhibit the glycolysis rate , but elevate the glucose flux into oxidative phosphorylation . These results demonstrate that miRNAs ( miR-124 , miR-137 and miR-340 ) impair colorectal cancer growth by counteracting the Warburg effect due to regulating alternative splicing of the PKM gene .
Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) are generally used in tissue engineering , regenerative medicine and therapy for immune disorder disease . MSCs are also employed as drug carriers for tumor therapy due to their ability to migrate to tumor tissue . However , due to the immunosuppressive function of MSCs , the application of MSCs in prostate cancer therapy remains limited . In this study , we investigated the underlying mechanism by which MSCs enable prostate cancer cells to escape from immune surveillance in the inflammatory microenvironment . Firstly , we demonstrated that compared with the control groups , MSCs pretreated with IL-1alpha effectively promoted the growth of the mouse prostate cancer cell line RM-1 invivo . Furthermore , when RM-1 prostate cancer cells were co-injected with MSCs pretreated with IL-1alpha , tumor incidence significantly increased in allogeneic recipients . In addition , we investigated the mechanism through which MSCs promote the ability of RM-1 cells to escape from immune injury . The results revealed that IL-1alpha led to the upregulation of TGF-beta in MSCs . The inflammatory cytokine-induced promotive effect of MSCs on RM-1 cells in vivo was inhibited by TGF-beta siRNA . The results of our study suggest that inflammatory cytokines induce the immunosuppressive function of MSCs which enables prostate cancer cells to escape from immune injury .
Pathological features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) include , in addition to selective motor neuron ( MN ) degeneration , the occurrence of protein aggregates , mitochondrial dysfunction and astrogliosis . SOD1 mutations cause rare familial forms of ALS and have provided the most widely studied animal models . Relatively recent studies implicating another protein , TDP-43 , in familial and sporadic forms of ALS have led to the development of new animal models . More recently , mutations in the valosin-containing protein ( VCP ) gene linked to the human genetic disease , Inclusion Body Myopathy associated with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia ( IBMPFD ) , were found also to be associated with ALS in some patients . A heterozygous knock-in VCP mouse model of IBMPFD ( VCP(R155H/+) ) exhibited muscle , bone and brain pathology characteristic of the human disease . We have undertaken studies of spinal cord pathology in VCP(R155H/+) mice and find age-dependent degeneration of ventral horn MNs , TDP-43-positive cytosolic inclusions , mitochondrial aggregation and progressive astrogliosis . Aged animals ( months ) show electromyography evidence of denervation consistent with the observed MN loss . Although these animals do not develop rapidly progressive fatal ALS-like disease during their lifespans , they recapitulate key pathological features of both human disease and other animal models of ALS , and may provide a valuable new model for studying events preceding onset of catastrophic disease .
BACKGROUND Nephronophthisis ( NPHP ) as a cause of cystic kidney disease is the most common genetic cause of progressive renal failure in children and young adults . NPHP is characterized by abnormal and/or loss of function of proteins associated with primary cilia . Previously , we characterized an autosomal recessive phenotype of cystic kidney disease in the Lewis Polycystic Kidney ( LPK ) rat . RESULTS In this study , quantitative trait locus analysis was used to define a Mbp region on rat chromosome 10q25 harbouring the lpk mutation . Targeted genome capture and next-generation sequencing of this region identified a non-synonymous mutation R650C in the NIMA ( never in mitosis gene a)- related kinase 8 ( Nek8 ) gene . This is a novel Nek8 mutation that occurs within the regulator of chromosome condensation 1 ( RCC1)-like region of the protein . Specifically , the R650C substitution is located within a G[QRC]LG repeat motif of the predicted seven bladed beta-propeller structure of the RCC1 domain . The rat Nek8 gene is located in a region syntenic to portions of human chromosome 17 and mouse 11 . Scanning electron microscopy confirmed abnormally long cilia on LPK kidney epithelial cells , and fluorescence immunohistochemistry for Nek8 protein revealed altered cilia localisation . CONCLUSIONS When assessed relative to other Nek8 NPHP mutations , our results indicate the whole propeller structure of the RCC1 domain is important , as the different mutations cause comparable phenotypes . This study establishes the LPK rat as a novel model system for NPHP and further consolidates the link between cystic kidney disease and cilia proteins .
Altered p53 protein is prevalently associated with the pathologic class of triple-negative breast cancers and loss of p53 function has recently been linked to the induction of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and acquisition of stemness properties . We explored the association between TP53 mutational status and expression of some genes involved in the canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway ( the most potent EMT inducer ) and in two early EMT associated events : loss of cell polarity and acquisition of stemness-associated features . We used a publicly accessible microarray dataset consisting of 251 p53-sequenced primary breast cancers . Statistical analysis indicated that mutant p53 tumors ( especially those harboring a severe mutation ) were consistent with the aggressive class of triple-negative cancers and that , differently from cell cultures , surgical tumors underexpressed some TGF-\u03b2 related transcription factors known as involved in EMT ( ID1 , ID4 , SMAD3 , SMAD4 , SMAD5 , ZEB1 ) . These unexpected findings suggest an interesting relationship between p53 mutation , mammary cell dedifferentiation , and the concomitant acquisition of stemlike properties ( as indicated by the overexpression of PROM1 and NOTCH1 genes ) , which improve tumor cells aggressiveness as indicated by the overexpression of genes associated with cell proliferation ( CDK4 , CDK6 , MKI67 ) and migration ( CXCR4 , MMP1 ) .
Breast cancer metastasis is the most common cause of cancer-related death in women . Thus , seeking targets of breast tumor cells is an attractive goal towards improving clinical treatment . The present study showed that CCL18 from tumor-associated macrophages could promote breast cancer metastasis via PITPNM3 . In addition , we found that pachymic acid ( PA ) could dose-dependently inhibit migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells , with or without rCCL18 stimulation . Furthermore , evidence was obtained that PA could suppress the phosphorylation of PITPNM3 and the combination of CCL18 and PITPNM3 . Therefore , we speculate that PA could inhibit breast cancer metastasis via PITPNM3 .
The calcium-calmodulin activated kinase CaMKII mediates many forms of learning and memory . Activity-regulated translocation of CaMKII to synapses is important for its functions in synaptic plasticity . Here , we tested the role of the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B in recruiting CaMKII\u03b1 to synapses with different paradigms : global bath stimulation of NMDA receptors , a chemical long term potentiation ( cLTP ) protocol that selectively activates synaptic NMDA receptors , or local stimulation of NMDA receptors at a contiguous set of synapses that triggers a propagating synaptic accumulation of CaMKII . Global or cLTP-induced synaptic accumulation of CaMKII\u03b1 occurred in wild-type but not sister GluN2B -/- cultured mouse hippocampal neurons . Expression of YFP-GluN2B , but not a similar level of YFP-GluN2A , rescued global and cLTP-induced CaMKII\u03b1 translocation . Using chimeric constructs , the pore-forming extracellular and membrane domains of GluN2A combined with the cytoplasmic tail of GluN2B were sufficient to rescue CaMKII\u03b1 translocation , whereas the reverse chimera was ineffective . Furthermore , the dual point mutation R1300Q,S1303D in GluN2B that blocks interaction of this high affinity site with CaMKII abolished rescue . Thus , CaMKII binding to GluN2B is required for global and cLTP-induced synaptic accumulation of CaMKII\u03b1 . However , surprisingly , locally induced propagating synaptic accumulation of CaMKII\u03b1 occurred normally in GluN2B -/- neurons , indistinguishably from wild-type . Thus , synaptic trapping of CaMKII during locally induced propagating translocation occurs by different mechanisms and molecular partners compared with global stimulation and cLTP paradigms . These findings underscore the complex regulatory properties and molecular interactions of CaMKII\u03b1 , a key player in synaptic plasticity .
The insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) pathway represents one of the most studied molecular regulatory networks in oncology . Clinical trials investigating the therapeutic value of anti-IGF1 receptor ( IGF1R ) therapies in cancer , including prostate cancer , are ongoing . However , the multiple functions of the IGF network in the prostate are not entirely known . To elucidate the effects of IGF and insulin ( INS ) on prostate cells , we stimulated prostate cancer ( PC3 , DU145 , LNCaP , DUCaP ) and noncancerous prostate cells ( EP156T , RWPE-1 ) and observed differing responses : whereas cancer cells responded to IGF and INS exposure by way of enhanced cell proliferation and glucose consumption , basal to luminal differentiation was induced in noncancerous cells . The same diverse responses were observed when the growth factor receptors IGF1R or INSR were overexpressed . Down-regulation of IGF1R or INSR isoform A ( INSRA ) also inhibited only proliferation of cancer cells . The proliferative response induced by the INSR in cancer cells was mediated solely by the INSRA . Moreover we observed that the receptors of the IGF network mutually influence their expression and exert redundant functions , thus underscoring the functional molecular network formed by IGF , INS , IGF1R , and INSR . Collectively we found that both IGF1R and INSRA have oncogenic effects in prostate cancer , but the IGF network also has important physiological functions in the noncancerous prostate . These data provide new insights into the biology of the IGF network in the prostate , thereby facilitating the design and interpretation of clinical studies investigating IGF1R targeting agents .
Domestic dog breeds have undergone intense selection for a variety of morphologic features , including size . Among small-dog breeds , defined as those averaging less than in. at the withers , there remains still considerable variation in body size . Yet essentially all such dogs are fixed for the same allele at the insulin-like growth factor 1 gene , which we and others previously found to be a size locus of large effect . In this study we sought to identify additional genes that contribute to tiny size in dogs using an association scan with the single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) dataset CanMap , in which 915 purebred dogs were genotyped at 60,968 SNP markers . Our strongest association for tiny size ( defined as breed-average height not more than 10 in. at the withers ) was on canine chromosome 3 ( p = 1.9 x 10(-70) ) . Fine mapping revealed a nonsynonymous SNP at chr3:44,706,389 that changes a highly conserved arginine at amino acid 204 to histidine in the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF1R ) . This mutation is predicted to prevent formation of several hydrogen bonds within the cysteine-rich domain of the receptor's ligand-binding extracellular subunit . Nine of 13 tiny dog breeds carry the mutation and many dogs are homozygous for it . This work underscores the central importance of the IGF1 pathway in controlling the tremendous size diversity of dogs .
5-Thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine ( also called spore photoproduct or SP ) is the exclusive DNA photodamage product in bacterial endospores . It is repaired by a radical SAM ( S-adenosylmethionine ) enzyme , the spore photoproduct lyase ( SPL ) , at the bacterial early germination phase . Our previous studies proved that SPL utilizes the 5'-dA\u2022 generated by the SAM cleavage reaction to abstract the H(6proR) atom to initiate the SP repair process . The resulting thymine allylic radical was suggested to take an H atom from an unknown protein source , most likely cysteine 141 . Here we show that C141 can be readily alkylated in the native SPL by an iodoacetamide treatment , suggesting that it is accessible to the TpT radical . SP repair by the SPL C141A mutant yields TpTSO(2)(-) and TpT simultaneously from the very beginning of the reaction ; no lag phase is observed for TpTSO(2)(-) formation . Should any other protein residue serve as the H donor , its presence would result in TpT being the major product at least for the first enzyme turnover . These observations provide strong evidence to support C141 as the direct H atom donor . Moreover , because of the lack of this intrinsic H donor , the C141A mutant produces TpT via an unprecedented thymine cation radical reduction ( proton-coupled electron transfer ) process , contrasting to the H atom transfer mechanism in the wild-type ( WT ) SPL reaction . The C141A mutant repairs SP at a rate that is slower than that of the WT enzyme . Formation of TpTSO(2)(-) and TpT exhibits a V(max) deuterium kinetic isotope effect ( KIE ) of 1.7 +/- 0.2 , which is smaller than the ( D)V(max ) KIE of 2.8 +/- 0.3 determined for the WT SPL reaction . These findings suggest that removing the intrinsic H atom donor disturbs the rate-limiting process during enzyme catalysis . As expected , the prereduced C141A mutant supports only turnover , which is in sharp contrast to the >5 turnovers exhibited by the WT SPL reaction , suggesting that the enzyme catalytic cycle ( SAM regeneration ) is disrupted by this single mutation .
BACKGROUND Although basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) is the most common type of skin cancer , the incidence of metastasis is exceedingly low . OBJECTIVE Case presentation of a basal cell carcinoma arising on the dorsum of the foot with inguinal and pelvic lymph node metastases . METHOD Case presentation with literature review . RESULT On the basis of our review of Japanese literature , the risk factors for BCC metastasis are occurrence on the genitalia , diameter of more than 3 cm , deep invasion of tumor cells into extradermal structures , and infiltrative/morpheic histological type . CONCLUSION Although metastasis from BCC is extremely rare , the prognosis of metastatic BCC is often poor . Careful follow-up is recommended in cases with high risk factors .
Mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene are found in more than 80% of colorectal cancer ( CRC ) patients . The nuclear transcription factor Nrf2 plays a central role in the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammation . Previously , we have shown that chronic inflammation in Nrf2(-/-) ( Nrf2 knockout ; KO ) mice resulted in higher expression of inflammatory markers and cytokines , coupled with higher inflammatory damage to the colonic crypt cells , as compared to the Nrf2(+/+) ( wild type ; WT ) mice . Induction of mutation in the colon by administration of carcinogen , AOM prior to DSS-induced inflammation resulted in higher tumor incidence and numbers in Nrf2KO mice . These results indicate that Nrf2-dependent inhibition of inflammation appears to be critical in inhibiting mutation-initiated colorectal carcinogenesis . In this study , we aim to investigate if loss of Nrf2 would dose-dependently promote intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(min/+) mice . To demonstrate the in vivo mechanisms , we constructed both Apc mutated and Nrf2 deficient strain Apc(min/+) mice with C57BL/6 Nrf2KO mice to obtain F1 , Apc(min/+) ;Nrf2(+/-) and F2 , Apc(min/+) ;Nrf2(-/-) mice . Nrf2KO decreased the protein expression of antioxidant enzyme NQO1 in Apc(min/+) . In contrast , Nrf2KO enhanced the expression of inflammatory markers such as COX-2 , cPLA , LTB(4) in Apc(min/+) . Finally , Nrf2KO resulted in higher level of PCNA and c-Myc expression in intestinal tissue , indicating the deficiency of Nrf2 promotes proliferation of intestinal crypt cells in Apc(min/+) . Taken together , our results suggest that Nrf2KO attenuates anti-oxidative stress pathway , induces inflammation , and increases proliferative potential in the intestinal crypts leading to enhanced intestinal carcinogenesis and adenomas in Apc(min/+) .

Placental Growth Factor ( PGF ) is a key molecule in angiogenesis . Several studies have revealed an important role of PGF primarily in pathological conditions ( e.g. : ischaemia , tumour formation , cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory processes ) suggesting its use as a potential therapeutic agent . However , to date , no information is available regarding the genetics of PGF variability . Furthermore , even though the effect of environmental factors ( e.g. : cigarette smoking ) on angiogenesis has been explored , no data on the influence of these factors on PGF levels have been reported so far . Here we have first investigated PGF variability in two cohorts focusing on non-genetic risk factors : a study sample from two isolated villages in the Cilento region , South Italy ( N=871 ) and a replication sample from the general Danish population ( N=1,812 ) . A significant difference in PGF mean levels was found between the two cohorts . However , in both samples , we observed a strong correlation of PGF levels with ageing and sex , men displaying PGF levels significantly higher than women . Interestingly , smoking was also found to influence the trait in the two populations , although differently . We have then focused on genetic risk factors . The association between five single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) located in the PGF gene and the plasma levels of the protein was investigated . Two polymorphisms ( rs11850328 and rs2268614 ) were associated with the PGF plasma levels in the Cilento sample and these associations were strongly replicated in the Danish sample . These results , for the first time , support the hypothesis of the presence of genetic and environmental factors influencing PGF plasma variability .
FZR1 is an anaphase-promoting complex ( APC ) activator best known for its role in the mitotic cell cycle at M-phase exit , in G1 , and in maintaining genome integrity . Previous studies also established that it prevents meiotic resumption , equivalent to the G2/M transition . Here we report that mouse oocytes lacking FZR1 undergo passage through meiosis I that is accelerated by h , and this is due to an earlier onset of spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) satisfaction and APC(CDC20) activity . However , loss of FZR1 did not compromise SAC functionality ; instead , earlier SAC satisfaction was achieved because the bipolar meiotic spindle was assembled more quickly in the absence of FZR1 . This novel regulation of spindle assembly by FZR1 led to premature bivalent attachment to microtubules and loss of kinetochore-bound MAD2 . Bivalents , however , were observed to congress poorly , leading to nondisjunction rates of 25% . We conclude that in mouse oocytes FZR1 controls the timing of assembly of the bipolar spindle and in so doing the timing of SAC satisfaction and APC(CDC20) activity . This study implicates FZR1 as a major regulator of prometaphase whose activity helps to prevent chromosome nondisjunction .
ABSTRACT : INTRODUCTION : Retinoic acid signaling plays key roles in embryonic development and in maintaining the differentiated status of adult tissues . Recently , the nuclear retinoic acid receptor ( RAR ) isotypes alpha , beta and gamma were found to play specific functions in the expansion and differentiation of the stem compartments of various tissues . For instance , RARgamma appears to be involved in stem cell compartment expansion , while RARalpha and RARbeta are implicated in the subsequent cell differentiation . We found that over-expressing c-Myc in normal mouse mammary epithelium and in a c-Myc-driven transgenic model of mammary cancer , disrupts the balance between RARgamma and RARalpha/beta in favor of RARgamma . METHODS : The effects of c-Myc on RAR isotype expression were evaluated in normal mouse mammary epithelium , mammary tumor cells obtained from the MMTV-Myc transgenic mouse model as well as human normal immortalized breast epithelial and breast cancer cell lines . The in vivo effect of the RARalpha-selective agonist 4-[(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthyl)carboxamido]benzoic acid ( Am580 ) was examined in the MMTV-Myc mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis . RESULTS : Modulation of the RARalpha/beta to RARgamma expression in mammary glands of normal mice , oncomice , and human mammary cell lines through the alteration of RAR-target gene expression affected cell proliferation , survival and tumor growth . Treatment of MMTV-Myc mice with the RARalpha-selective agonist Am580 led to significant inhibition of mammary tumor growth ( P<0.001 ) , lung metastasis ( P<0.01 ) and extended tumor latency in 63% of mice . Immunocytochemical analysis showed that in these mice , RARalpha responsive genes such as Cyp26A1 , E-cadherin , cellular retinol-binding protein 1 ( CRBP1 ) and p27 , were up-regulated . In contrast , the mammary gland tumors of mice that responded poorly to Am580 treatment ( 37% ) expressed significantly higher levels of RARgamma . In vitro experiments indicated that the rise in RARgamma was functionally linked to promotion of tumor growth and inhibition of differentiation . Thus , activation of the RARalpha pathway is linked to tumor growth inhibition , differentiation and cell death . CONCLUSIONS : The functional consequence of the interplay between c-Myc oncogene expression and the RARgamma to RARalpha/beta balance suggests that prevalence of RARgamma over-RARalpha/beta expression levels in breast cancer accompanied by c-Myc amplification or over-expression in breast cancer should be predictive of response to treatment with RARalpha-isotype-specific agonists and warrant monitoring during clinical trials.See related editorial by Garattini et al http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/5/111 .
BACKGROUND The circumscription of the avian superfamily Sylvioidea is a matter of long ongoing debate . While the overall inclusiveness has now been mostly agreed on and 20 families recognised , the phylogenetic relationships among the families are largely unknown . We here present a phylogenetic hypothesis for Sylvioidea based on one mitochondrial and six nuclear markers , in total kbp , for 79 ingroup species representing all currently recognised families and some species with uncertain affinities , making this the most comprehensive analysis of this taxon . RESULTS The resolution , especially of the deeper nodes , is much improved compared to previous studies . However , many relationships among families remain uncertain and are in need of verification . Most families themselves are very well supported based on the total data set and also by indels . Our data do not support the inclusion of Hylia in Cettiidae , but do not strongly reject a close relationship with Cettiidae either . The genera Scotocerca and Erythrocercus are closely related to Cettiidae , but separated by relatively long internodes . The families Paridae , Remizidae and Stenostiridae clustered among the outgroup taxa and not within Sylvioidea . CONCLUSIONS Although the phylogenetic position of Hylia is uncertain , we tentatively support the recognition of the family Hyliidae Bannerman , 1923 for this genus and Pholidornis . We propose new family names for the genera Scotocerca and Erythrocercus , Scotocercidae and Erythrocercidae , respectively , rather than including these in Cettiidae , and we formally propose the name Macrosphenidae , which has been in informal use for some time . We recommend that Paridae , Remizidae and Stenostiridae are not included in Sylvioidea . We also briefly discuss the problems of providing a morphological diagnosis when proposing a new family-group name ( or genus-group name ) based on a clade .
Curcumin ( diferuloylmethane ) is a polyphenol derived from the plant turmeric ( Curcuma longa ) , which is commonly used as a spice . Although anti-carcinogenic , anti-oxidant , anti-inflammation , and anti-angiogenic properties have been reported , the effect of curcumin on breast cancer metastasis is unknown . Matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) is a major component in cancer cell invasion . In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effect of curcumin on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion and the molecular mechanisms involved in MCF-7 cells . Our results showed that curcumin inhibits TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion through suppressing NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation . Also , curcumin strongly repressed the TPA-induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK and inhibited TPA-induced translocation of PKCalpha from the cytosol to the membrane , but did not affect the translocation of PKCdelta . These results indicate that curcumin-mediated inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion involves the suppression of the PKCalpha , MAPK and NF-kappaB/AP-1 pathway in MCF-7 cells . Curcumin may have potential value in restricting breast cancer metastasis .
A recurrent mutation affecting codon 132 of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 ) gene has been found in of primary glioblastomas ( GBMs ) , but in >70% of secondary GBMs or oligodendroglial and astrocytic tumors . We investigated IDH1 mutations in a series of 134 brain tumors to determine the prevalence and prognostic impact of IDH1 mutations . We also examined the correlations among histology , p53 and PTEN immunoexpression , MGMT methylation status , 1p 19q co-deletion and EGFR gene amplification . The 134 brain tumors included 41 low-grade oligodendrogliomas ( LOs ) , 47 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas ( AOs ) and 46 primary GBMs . Data showed that 53.7% ( 72/134 ) of cases showed mutations affecting codon 132 of IDH1 , including 73.2% of LOs , 82.9% of AOs and three primary GBMs ( 6.5% ) . All IDH1 mutations were Arg132His . In a survival analysis , patients with IDH1 mutations had better survival compared to those with wild-type IDH1 ( p<0.05 ) in LOs and AOs , but not in primary GBMs ( p=0.587 ) . In addition , in patients with both IDH1 mutation and MGMT methylation , p53 overexpression was a significant poor prognostic factor both in LOs and AOs . However , IDH1 mutation was not correlated with common genetic profiles that affect patient prognosis , including MGMT methylation , 1p 19q co-deletion , PTEN loss and EGFR amplification in LOs , AOs and GBMs . From our results , IDH1 mutation was an independent positive prognostic factor in LOs and AOs , especially in the absence of p53 overexpression .
Androgen receptor ( AR ) signals have been suggested to contribute to bladder tumorigenesis and cancer progression . Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) also leads to stimulation of bladder tumor growth . However , crosstalk between AR and EGFR pathways in bladder cancer remains uncharacterized . We have recently shown that androgens activate the EGFR pathway in bladder cancer cells . The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of EGF on AR activity in bladder cancer . EGF increased AR transcriptional activity by 1.2- , 1.9- and 2.0-fold in UMUC3 , 5637-AR and J82-AR cell lines , respectively , over mock treatment and a specific EGFR inhibitor , PD168393 , antagonized the EGF effect . Combined treatment of EGF and dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) further induced AR transactivation while an AR antagonist , hydroxyflutamide ( HF ) , abolished the effect of not only DHT but also EGF . In growth assays , EGF alone/DHT alone/EGF+DHT increased cell numbers by 16/12/19% , 6/14/18% and 30/12/38% in UMUC3-control-shRNA , 5637-AR and J82-AR , respectively , whereas the effects of EGF were marginal or less significant in UMUC3-AR-shRNA ( 8% ) or AR-negative 5637-V ( <1% ) and J82-V ( 17% ) cells . HF treatment at least partially counteracted the EGF effect on the growth of AR-positive cells . Western blotting demonstrated that EGF , especially in the presence of DHT , upregulated the expression of the p160 coactivator TIF2 and HF again blocked this stimulation . Co-immunoprecipitation revealed the association between AR and estrogen receptor ( ER)-beta or Src in UMUC3 cells and stronger associations with EGF treatment , implying the involvement of the AR/ER/Src complex in EGF-increased AR transactivation and cell growth . Current results , thus , suggest that EGF promotes bladder cancer cell proliferation via modulation of AR signals . Taken together with our previous findings , crosstalk between EGFR and AR pathways can play an important role in the progression of bladder cancer .
Extracellular respiration of solid-phase electron acceptors in some microorganisms requires a complex chain of multiheme c-type cytochromes that span the inner and outer membranes . In Shewanella species , MtrA , an periplasmic decaheme c-type cytochrome , is an essential component for extracellular respiration of iron(III) . The exact mechanism of electron transport has not yet been resolved , but the arrangement of the polypeptide chain may have a strong influence on the capability of the MtrA cytochrome to transport electrons . The iron hemes of MtrA are bound to its polypeptide chain via proximal ( CXXCH ) and distal histidine residues . In this study , we show the effects of mutating histidine residues of MtrA to arginine on protein expression and extracellular respiration using Shewanella sp. strain ANA-3 as a model organism . Individual mutations to six out of nine proximal histidines in CXXCH of MtrA led to decreased protein expression . However , distal histidine mutations resulted in various degrees of protein expression . In addition , the effects of histidine mutations on extracellular respiration were tested using ferrihydrite and current production in microbial fuel cells . These results show that proximal histidine mutants were unable to reduce ferrihydrite . Mutations to the distal histidine residues resulted in various degrees of ferrihydrite reduction . These findings indicate that mutations to the proximal histidine residues affect MtrA expression , leading to loss of extracellular respiration ability . In contrast , mutations to the distal histidine residues are less detrimental to protein expression , and extracellular respiration can proceed .
BACKGROUND Angiogenesis plays an important role in the progression of colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . Studies have indicated vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) is the predominant angiogenic factor . Cyclin D1 ( CCND1 ) induces production of VEGF and is required for migration of blood vessels . Our aim was to determine the roles of CCND1 and VEGF overexpression in CRC patients . METHODS We analyzed clinicopathological features , VEGF and CCND1 expressions by immunohistochemical ( IHC ) staining in 100 stage I-III CRC patients ( 44 were postoperative relapsed ; 56 were postoperative non-relapsed ) to determine the correlation between clinicopathologic features and co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF . Furthermore , the clinical outcomes of co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF were investigated . RESULTS Multivariate analysis showed vascular invasion ( P = 0.019 ) , VEGF overexpression ( P = 0.033 ) , and high postoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) levels ( P = 0.022 ) were independent predictors of postoperative relapse . Co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF overexpression had significantly poorer disease-free survival rates ( P = 0.004 ) and overall survival rates ( P = 0.001 ) than other phenotypes . CONCLUSIONS Co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF overexpression would potentially assist in TNM staging systems to predict the prognosis of these patients who would benefit from intensive follow-up and therapeutic programs .
Cancer immunoediting is the process whereby immune cells protect against cancer formation by sculpting the immunogenicity of developing tumors . Although the full process depends on innate and adaptive immunity , it remains unclear whether innate immunity alone is capable of immunoediting . To determine whether the innate immune system can edit tumor cells in the absence of adaptive immunity , we compared the incidence and immunogenicity of 3'methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas in syngeneic wild-type , RAG2(-/-) , and RAG2(-/-)x gammac(-/-) mice . We found that innate immune cells could manifest cancer immunoediting activity in the absence of adaptive immunity . This activity required natural killer ( NK ) cells and interferon gamma ( IFN-gamma ) , which mediated the induction of M1 macrophages . M1 macrophages could be elicited by administration of CD40 agonists , thereby restoring editing activity in RAG2(-/-)x gammac(-/-) mice . Our results suggest that in the absence of adaptive immunity , NK cell production of IFN-gamma induces M1 macrophages , which act as important effectors during cancer immunoediting .
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 ( MEN2 ) is an autosomal , dominantly inherited disease characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma , pheochromocytoma , and primary hyperparathyroidism and is divided into types 2A and 2B . Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma ( FMTC ) is characterized by the presence of medullary thyroid carcinoma alone in family members and is considered to be one of the subtypes of MEN2 . Clinical and genetic data on 505 Japanese patients from 275 MEN2 or FMTC families registered at 54 medical institutions were collected by the MEN Consortium of Japan . The diagnosis was MEN2A in 343 ( 67.9% ) patients , MEN2B in 29 ( 5.7% ) , FMTC in 103 ( 20.4% ) , and unclassified in 30 ( 5.9% ) . Medullary thyroid carcinoma was found in 91.2% of patients ( 437/479 ) , pheochromocytoma in 45.6% ( 212/465 ) , and primary hyperparathyroidism in 8.1% ( 37/457 ) . RET genetic testing was performed in 410 patients , and the germline RET mutation was found in 98.8% ( 397/402 ) .
BACKGROUND Inherited malabsorption of cobalamin ( Cbl ) causes hematological and neurological abnormalities that can be fatal . Three genes have been implicated in Cbl malabsorption ; yet , only about 10% of reported cases have been molecularly studied to date . Recessive mutations in CUBN or AMN cause Imerslund-Grasbeck Syndrome ( IGS ) , while recessive mutations in GIF cause Intrinsic Factor Deficiency ( IFD ) . IGS and IFD differ in that IGS usually presents with proteinuria , which is not observed in IFD . The genetic heterogeneity and numerous differential diagnoses make clinical assessment difficult . METHODS We present a large genetic screening study of 154 families or patients with suspected hereditary Cbl malabsorption . Patients and their families have been accrued over a period spanning >12\u2009 years . Systematic genetic testing of the three genes CUBN , AMN , and GIF was accomplished using a combination of single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA and RNA sequencing . In addition , six genes that were contenders for a role in inherited Cbl malabsorption were studied in a subset of these patients . RESULTS Our results revealed population-specific mutations , mutational hotspots , and functionally distinct regions in the three causal genes . We identified mutations in 126/154 unrelated cases ( 82% ) . Fifty-three of 126 cases ( 42% ) were mutated in CUBN , 45/126 ( 36% ) were mutated in AMN , and 28/126 ( 22% ) had mutations in GIF . We found 26 undescribed mutations in CUBN , 19 in AMN , and 7 in GIF for a total of 52 novel defects described herein . We excluded six other candidate genes as culprits and concluded that additional genes might be involved . CONCLUSIONS Cbl malabsorption is found worldwide and genetically complex . However , our results indicate that population-specific founder mutations are quite common . Consequently , targeted genetic testing has become feasible if ethnic ancestry is considered . These results will facilitate clinical and molecular genetic testing of Cbl malabsorption . Early diagnosis improves the lifelong care required by these patients and prevents potential neurological long-term complications . This study provides the first comprehensive overview of the genetics that underlies the inherited Cbl malabsorption phenotype .
Emergence of vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus ( VISA ) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus ( VRSA ) strains has led to global concerns about treatments for staphylococcal infections . These strains are currently rare even though there is an upward trend in their reported incidence . Therefore , appropriate screening and epidemiological evaluation of VRSA strains can affect future global health care policies . Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were obtained from various clinical samples and were then evaluated with agar screening , disk diffusion , and MIC methods to determine resistance to vancomycin and methicillin . After confirmation of the isolated VRSA strain , genetic analysis was performed by evaluating mecA and vanA gene presence , SCCmec , agr , and spa types , and toxin profiles . Multilocus sequence typing ( MLST ) and plasmid analysis were also performed . The VRSA strain was resistant to oxacillin ( MIC of 128 \u03bcg/ml ) and vancomycin ( MIC of 512 \u03bcg/ml ) . Disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed resistance to oxacillin , vancomycin , levofloxacin , ciprofloxacin , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole , clindamycin , rifampin , and tetracycline . The isolate was susceptible to minocycline and gentamicin . PCRs were positive for the mecA and vanA genes . Other genetic characteristics include SCCmec type III , agr I , spa type t037 , and sequence type ( ST ) 1283 . The plasmid profile shows five plasmids with a size of kb to >10 kb . The isolated VRSA strain was obtained from a critically ill hospitalized patient . Genetic analysis of this strain suggested that the strain was a methicillin-resistant S. aureus ( MRSA ) clone endemic in Asia that underwent some genetic changes , such as mutation in the gmk gene and acquisition of the vanA gene .
The development of targeted therapies and immunotherapies has markedly advanced the treatment of metastasized melanoma . While treatment with selective BRAF(V600E) inhibitors ( like vemurafenib or dabrafenib ) leads to high response rates but short response duration , CTLA-4 blocking therapies induce sustained responses , but only in a limited number of patients . The combination of these diametric treatment approaches may further improve survival , but pre-clinical data concerning this approach is limited . We investigated , using Tyr::CreER(T2)PTEN(F-/-)BRAF(F-V600E/+) inducible melanoma mice , whether BRAF(V600E) inhibition can synergize with anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment , focusing on the interaction between the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor PLX4720 and the immune system . While PLX4720 treatment strongly decreased tumor growth , it did not induce cell death in BRAF(V600E)/PTEN(-/-) melanomas . More strikingly , PLX4720 treatment led to a decreased frequency of tumor-resident T cells , NK-cells , MDSCs and macrophages , which could not be restored by the addition of anti-CTLA-4 mAb . As this effect was not observed upon treatment of BRAF wild-type B16F10 tumors , we conclude that the decreased frequency of immune cells correlates to BRAF(V600E) inhibition in tumor cells and is not due to an off-target effect of PLX4720 on immune cells . Furthermore , anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment of inducible melanoma mice treated with PLX4720 did not result in enhanced tumor control , while anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment did improve the effect of tumor-vaccination in B16F10-inoculated mice . Our data suggest that vemurafenib may negatively affect the immune activity within the tumor . Therefore , the potential effect of targeted therapy on the tumor-microenvironment should be taken into consideration in the design of clinical trials combining targeted and immunotherapy .
BACKGROUND The presence of distant metastases from colorectal cancer ( CRC ) does not preclude curative treatment . Early detection of pulmonary metastases at a potentially curable stage could improve survival . The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic significance of commonly reported clinicopathologic features to identify high-risk patients who would likely benefit from more intensive chest surveillance for pulmonary metastases . MATERIAL AND METHOD A total of 351 consecutive patients , with surgical stages I-III colorectal cancer , who underwent curative resection at Phramongkutklao hospital from 1999 to 2005 , were followed regularly according to the established guidelines with routine physical examination , serum carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) and colonoscopic surveillance . Imaging studies for detecting metastases were computed tomography ( CT ) , plain film radiography , and ultrasonograpy . Clinical and pathologic features were analyzed for their association with pulmonary metastasis . RESULTS There were 145 patients who had been operated for longer than five years after curative intent surgery . Of these , nineteen patients were lost to follow-up or died from other causes that were unrelated to colorectal cancer . Pulmonary metastases were detected in 26 patients by either CXR or CT scan . Median time to pulmonary metastasis was 19 months ( 95 percent CI , 12-35 ) . According to an univariate analysis , with log-rank test , identified four factors associated with pulmonary metastasis : Tumor stage T4 , Nodal stage N2 , elevation of serum CEA > 3.4 ng/ml and presence of lymphovascular invasion(LVI) . According to a multivariate analysis , with Cox regression , found an elevation of serum CEA > 3.4 ng/ml which was an independent factor that was significantly associated with pulmonary metastasis ( Hazard ratio ( HR ) , 8.9 ; 95 percent CI , 3.6-22 ; p < 0.01 ) . The present study revealed that 50 percent of patients who had more than one of these risk factors would eventually develop pulmonary metastases . CONCLUSION An elevation of serum CEA > or = 3.4 ng/ml was found as an independent factor that was significantly associated with pulmonary metastasis whereas tumor stage T4 , nodal stage N2 and presence of lymphovascular invasion ( LVI ) were not independent clinicopathologic features associated with subsequent pulmonary metastases . Chest CT scan has greater sensitivity than chest radiography in detection of pulmonary metastasis and should be considered as an imaging study of choice for intensive chest surveillance for patients who had more than one of these risk factors .
It has been well known for ages that in living organisms the rhythmicity of biological processes is linked to the 24-hour light-dark cycle . However , the exact function of the circadian clock system has been explored only in the past decades . It came to light that the photosensitive primary " master clock " is situated in the suprachiasmatic photosensitive nuclei of the special hypothalamic region , and that it is working according to changes of light and darkness . The master clock sends its messages to the peripheral " slave clocks " . In many organs , like pancreatic beta-cells , the slave clocks have autonomic functions as well . Two essential components of the clock system are proteins encoded by the CLOCK and BMAL1 genes . CLOCK genes are in interaction with endonuclear receptors such as peroxisoma-proliferator activated receptors and Rev-erb-alpha , as well as with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis , regulating the adaptation to stressors , energy supply , metabolic processes and cardiovascular system . Melatonin , the product of corpus pineale has a significant role in the functions of the clock system . The detailed discovery of the clock system has changed our previous knowledge about the development of many diseases . The most explored fields are hypertension , cardiovascular diseases , metabolic processes , mental disorders , cancers , sleep apnoe and joint disorders . CLOCK genes influence ageing as well . The recognition of the periodicity of biological processes makes the optimal dosing of certain drugs feasible . The more detailed discovery of the interaction of the clock system might further improve treatment and prevention of many disorders .
Here , we investigated the compartment-specific role of cell cycle arrest and senescence in breast cancer tumor growth . For this purpose , we generated a number of hTERT-immortalized senescent fibroblast cell lines overexpressing CDK inhibitors , such as p16(INK4A) , p19(ARF) or p21(WAF1/CIP1) . Interestingly , all these senescent fibroblast cell lines showed evidence of increased susceptibility toward the induction of autophagy ( either at baseline or after starvation ) , as well as significant mitochondrial dysfunction . Most importantly , these senescent fibroblasts also dramatically promoted tumor growth ( up to without any comparable increases in tumor angiogenesis . Conversely , we generated human breast cancer cells ( MDA-MB-231 cells ) overexpressing CDK inhibitors , namely p16(INK4A) or p21(WAF1/CIP1) . Senescent MDA-MB-231 cells also showed increased expression of markers of cell cycle arrest and autophagy , including beta-galactosidase , as predicted . Senescent MDA-MB-231 cells had retarded tumor growth , with up to a near 2-fold reduction in tumor volume . Thus , the effects of CDK inhibitors are compartment-specific and are related to their metabolic effects , which results in the induction of autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction . Finally , induction of cell cycle arrest with specific inhibitors ( PD0332991 ) or cellular stressors [ hydrogen peroxide ( H(2)O(2) ) or starvation ] indicated that the onset of autophagy and senescence are inextricably linked biological processes . The compartment-specific induction of senescence ( and hence autophagy ) may be a new therapeutic target that could be exploited for the successful treatment of human breast cancer patients .
Innate immunity in corals is of special interest not only in the context of self-defense but also in relation to the establishment and collapse of their obligate symbiosis with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium . In innate immunity system of vertebrates , approximately 20 tripartite nucleotide oligomerization domain ( NOD)-like receptor proteins that are defined by the presence of a NAIP , CIIA , HET-E and TP1 ( NACHT ) domain , a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat ( LRR ) domain , and one of three types of N-terminal effector domain , are known to function as the primary intracellular pattern recognition molecules . Surveying the coral genome revealed not only a larger number of NACHT- and related domain nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by APAF-1 , R proteins , and CED-4 ( NB-ARC)-encoding loci ( than in other metazoans but also surprising diversity of domain combinations among the coral NACHT/NB-ARC-containing proteins ; N-terminal effector domains included the apoptosis-related domains caspase recruitment domain ( CARD ) , death effector domain ( DED ) , and Death , and C-terminal repeat domains included LRRs , tetratricopeptide repeats , ankyrin repeats , and WD40 repeats . Many of the predicted coral proteins that contain a NACHT/NB-ARC domain also contain a glycosyl transferase group 1 domain , a novel domain combination first found in metazoans . Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the NACHT/NB-ARC domain inventories of various metazoan lineages , including corals , are largely products of lineage-specific expansions . Many of the NACHT/NB-ARC loci are organized in pairs or triplets in the Acropora genome , suggesting that the large coral NACHT/NB-ARC repertoire has been generated at least in part by tandem duplication . In addition , shuffling of N-terminal effector domains may have occurred after expansions of specific NACHT/NB-ARC-repeat domain types . These results illustrate the extraordinary complexity of the innate immune repertoire of corals , which may in part reflect adaptive evolution to a symbiotic lifestyle in a uniquely complex and challenging environment .
Bimolecular reactions in Earth's atmosphere are generally assumed to proceed between reactants whose internal quantum states are fully thermally relaxed . Here , we highlight a dramatic role for vibrationally excited bimolecular reactants in the oxidation of acetylene . The reaction proceeds by preliminary adduct formation between the alkyne and OH radical , with subsequent O(2) addition . Using a detailed theoretical model , we show that the product-branching ratio is determined by the excited vibrational quantum-state distribution of the adduct at the moment it reacts with O(2) . Experimentally , we found that under the simulated atmospheric conditions O(2) intercepts of the excited adducts before their vibrational quantum states have fully relaxed . Analogous interception of excited-state radicals by O(2) is likely common to a range of atmospheric reactions that proceed through peroxy complexes .
Activating c-KIT mutations ( exons 11 and 17 ) are found in 10-40% of testicular seminomas , the majority being missense point mutations ( codon 816 ) . Malignant ovarian dysgerminomas represent of all ovarian cancers in Western countries , resembling testicular seminomas , regarding chromosomal aberrations and c-KIT mutations . DSD patients with specific Y-sequences have an increased risk for Type II Germ Cell Tumor/Cancer , with gonadoblastoma as precursor progressing to dysgerminoma . Here we present analysis of c-KIT exon 8 , 9 , 11 , 13 and 17 , and PDGFRA exon 12 , 14 and 18 by conventional sequencing together with mutational analysis of c-KIT codon 816 by a sensitive and specific LightCycler melting curve analysis , confirmed by sequencing . The results are combined with data on TSPY and OCT3/4 expression in a series of 16 DSD patients presenting with gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma and 15 patients presenting pure ovarian dysgerminomas without DSD. c-KIT codon 816 mutations were detected in five out of the total of 31 cases ( all found in pure ovarian dysgerminomas ) . A synonymous SNP ( rs 5578615 ) was detected in two patients , one DSD patient ( with bilateral disease ) and one patient with dysgerminoma . Next to these , three codon N822K mutations were detected in the group of 15 pure ovarian dysgerminomas . In total activating c-KIT mutations were found in 53% of ovarian dysgerminomas without DSD . In the group of 16 DSD cases a N505I and D820E mutation was found in a single tumor of a patient with gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma . No PDGFRA mutations were found . Positive OCT3/4 staining was present in all gonadoblastomas and dysgerminomas investigated , TSPY expression was only seen in the gonadoblastoma/dysgerminoma lesions of the 16 DSD patients . This data supports the existence of two distinct but parallel pathways in the development of dysgerminoma , in which mutational status of c-KIT might parallel the presence of TSPY .
Therapy-induced senescence ( TIS ) , a cytostatic stress response in cancer cells , is induced inefficiently by current anticancer agents and radiation . The mechanisms that mediate TIS in cancer cells are not well defined . Herein , we characterize a robust senescence response both in vitro and in vivo to the quinone diaziquone ( AZQ ) , previously identified in a high-throughput senescence-induction small-molecule screen . Using AZQ and several other agents that induce senescence , we screened a series of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and found that p27(Kip1) was induced in all investigated prostate cancer cell lines . The ubiquitin-ligase Skp2 negatively regulates p27(Kip1) and , during TIS , is translocated to the cytoplasm before its expression is decreased in senescent cells . Overexpression of Skp2 blocks the effects of AZQ on senescence and p27(Kip1) induction . We also find that stable long-term short hairpin RNA knockdown of Skp2 decreases proliferation but does not generate the complete senescence phenotype . We conclude that Skp2 participates in regulating TIS but , alone , is insufficient to induce senescence in cancer cells .
Elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia generally have a poor prognosis and a highly heterogeneous clinical outcome . Prognostic indicators are required for and aid in patient stratification . However , the prognostic value of genetic mutations and immunophenotypic features in elderly normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia , the largest cytogenetic risk group , remains unclear . We investigated the genetic mutations NPM1 , FLT3-ITD , and FLT3-TKD and expression of the membrane antigens CD7 , CD15 , CD34 , and CD56 in 144 elderly patients with de novo normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia to retrospectively analyze the prognostic and clinical relevance of these parameters . CD7 , CD15 , CD34 , and CD56 were expressed in 24% , 47% , 52% , and 15% of patients , respectively . NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations were detected in 51% and 17% of patients , respectively . Complete remission was obtained in 94 patients ( 65% ) , and the median overall survival was 16.5 months . Univariate analysis detected 5 markers with prognostic relevance : high leukocyte count , FLT3-ITD mutations , NPM1 mutations , CD34 expression , and CD56 expression in acute myeloid leukemia blasts . In multivariate analysis , patients with NPM1 predicted a higher complete remission ( CR ) rate ( P = .016 ) , longer event-free survival ( P = .008 ) , and longer overall survival ( P = .049 ) . FLT3-ITD mutations predicted a shorter event-free survival ( P = .002 ) and shorter overall survival ( P < .001 ) . CD56 remained an independent predictor for lower CR rate ( P = .021 ) and shorter event-free survival ( P = .002 ) . Our data highlight the prognostic importance of both genetic and immunophenotypic characteristics in this population of elderly patients with newly diagnosed normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia . By combining genetic and immunophenotypic markers , we can divide patients into distinct prognostic groups with important implications for prognostic stratification and risk-adapted therapy .
Previous studies have shown that copy-number variants ( CNVs ) contribute to the risk of complex developmental phenotypes . However , the contribution of global CNV burden to the risk of sporadic congenital heart disease ( CHD ) remains incompletely defined . We generated genome-wide CNV data by using Illumina 660W-Quad SNP arrays in 2,256 individuals with CHD , 283 trio CHD-affected families , and 1,538 controls . We found association of rare genic deletions with CHD risk ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 1.8 , p = 0.0008 ) . Rare deletions in study participants with CHD had higher gene content ( p = 0.001 ) with higher haploinsufficiency scores ( p = 0.03 ) than they did in controls , and they were enriched with Wnt-signaling genes ( p = 1 x 10(-5) ) . Recurrent 15q11.2 deletions were associated with CHD risk ( OR = 8.2 , p = 0.02 ) . Rare de novo CNVs were observed in of CHD trios ; 10 out of 11 occurred on the paternally transmitted chromosome ( p = 0.01 ) . Some of the rare de novo CNVs spanned genes known to be involved in heart development ( e.g. , HAND2 and GJA5 ) . Rare genic deletions contribute of the population-attributable risk of sporadic CHD . Second to previously described CNVs at 1q21.1 , deletions at 15q11.2 and those implicating Wnt signaling are the most significant contributors to the risk of sporadic CHD . Rare de novo CNVs identified in CHD trios exhibit paternal origin bias .
Angiogenesis is defined as the formation of new blood vessels form existing vessels surrounding a tumor . The process of angiogenesis is an important step for tumor growth and metastasis , as is inflammation . Thus , angiogenesis inhibitors that suppress inflammation have been studied as an anticancer treatment . Recently , many research groups have investigated the anti-angiogenic activity of natural compounds since some have been demonstrated to have anticancer properties . Among many natural compounds , we focused on betaine , which is known to suppress inflammation . Betaine , trimethylglycine ( TMG ) , was first discovered in the juice of sugar beets and was later shown to be present in wheat , shellfish and spinach . In Southeast Asia , betaine is used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of hepatic disorders . Here , we report the anti-angiogenic action of betaine . Betaine inhibited invitro angiogenic cascade , tube formation , migration and invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . Betaine also inhibited invivo angiogenesis in the mouse Matrigel plug assay . The mRNA expression levels of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2 ) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) in HUVECs were decreased by betaine treatment . In addition , betaine suppressed NF-kappaB and Akt activation .
Dendritic cells ( DCs ) and natural killer ( NK ) cells are central components of innate immunity for controlling tumor growth . The therapeutic effects of certain anti-myeloma drugs are partially mediated by targeting the innate immune response . In addition , novel types of natural compounds have been developed that efficiently modulate the activity of both the cellular and humoral compartments of immunity . MGN-3 is known as an activator of natural killer cells , inducer of apoptosis and cytokine production , and modulator of dendritic cell maturation and differentiation in vitro . We have performed a randomized , placebo-controlled study to examine the effects of MGN-3 on innate immune system parameters in 48 multiple myeloma patients . We performed immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood samples , determined NK cell activity , and assessed the cytokine profiles of plasma before and during 3months of treatment . The results demonstrate a clear increase in NK activity in MGN-3-treated patients compared to the placebo group , an increased level of myeloid DCs in peripheral blood , and augmented concentrations of T helper cell type 1-related cytokines . The present study suggests that MGN-3 may represent an immunologically relevant product for activating innate immunity in multiple myeloma patients and warrants further testing to demonstrate clinical efficacy .
AIM To elucidate the roles of receptor tyrosine kinases RET and VEGFR2 and the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade in cancer treatment with sorafenib . METHODS The cell lines A549 , HeLa , and HepG2 were tested . The enzyme activity was examined under cell-free conditions using 384-well microplate assays . Cell proliferation was evaluated using the Invitrogen Alarmar Blue assay . Gene expression was analyzed using the Invitrogen SYBR Green expression assays with a sequence detection system . Protein expression analysis was performed using Western blotting . RESULTS Sorafenib potently suppressed the activities of cRAF , VEGFR2 , and RET with IC(50) values of 20.9 , 4 and 0.4 nmol/L , respectively . Sorafenib inhibited cRAF , VEGFR2 , and RET via non-ATP-competitive , ATP-competitive and mixed-type modes , respectively . In contrast , sorafenib exerted only moderate cytotoxic effects on the proliferation of the 3 cell lines . The IC(50) values for inhibition of A549 , HeLa , and HepG2 cells were 8572 , 4163 , and 8338 nmol/L , respectively . In the 3 cell lines , sorafenib suppressed the cell proliferation mainly by blocking the MEK/ERK downstream pathway at the posttranscriptional level , which in turn regulated related gene expression via a feed-back mechanism . CONCLUSION This study provides novel evidence that protein kinases RET and VEGFR2 play crucial roles in cancer treatment with sorafenib .
Background/Aims : Cimetidine has been shown to play an important role in the treatment of cancer and the regulation of the immune system . Therefore , we aimed to observe the effects of cimetidine on the systematic immune response in the perioperative period . Methodology : Sixty patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled from Jan 2005 to Dec 2005 from Taizhou Hospital . The patients were administrated with cimetidine ( 0.8g<FFFD>d-1 or 1.2g<FFFD>d-1 ) or saline from the day of admission to the 10th POD . Venous blood sample was collected and the T- , B- and NK-lymphocyte subsets were determined by flow cytometry . The specimens were subjected to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) response examination . Results : The levels of CD3 and CD4 T-lymphocytes were increased significantly in both low and high dose cimetidine groups 10 days after operation . The number of CD19 B cells was also elevated by cimetidine . However , no significant changes were observed in the CD8 , CD4/CD8 value . TIL responses in the cimetidine groups were also enhanced significantly . Conclusions : Cimetidine can alleviate systematic immunosuppression and improve the local immune function of the colorectal cancer patients in the perioperative period .
Molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations of the single-stranded DNA trinucleotide TG*G* , with the G* guanines crosslinked by the antitumor drug cisplatin , were performed with explicit representation of the water as solvent . The purpose of the simulations was to explain previous NMR observations indicating that in single-stranded cisplatin-DNA adducts , the crosslinked guanines adopt a left-handed helical orientation , whereas in duplexes , the orientation is right-handed . The analysis of the MD trajectory of TG*G* has ascribed a crucial role to hydrogen-bonding ( direct or through-water ) interactions of the 5'-oriented NH(3) ligand of platinum with acceptor groups at the 5'-side of the crosslink , namely the TpG* phosphate and the terminal 5'-OH group . These interactions bring about some strain into the trinucleotide which is slightly but significantly ( 1-1.5 kcal.mol(-1) ) higher for the right-handed orientation than for the left-handed one . During the unconstrained , 3 ns long MD simulation , left-handed conformations were times more abundant than the right-handed ones . This sampling difference agrees roughly with the calculated energy difference in strain energy . Overall , these results show that the Pt-GG crosslink within single-stranded DNA is malleable and can access different conformations at a moderate energy cost . This malleability could be of importance in interactions between the platinated DNA and cellular proteins , in which the DNA is locally unwound .
PURPOSE This study investigated the impact of specific mutations in codon 12 of the Kirsten-ras ( KRAS ) gene on treatment efficacy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) . PATIENTS Overall , 119 patients bearing a KRAS mutation in codon 12 were evaluated . All patients received cetuximab-based first-line chemotherapy within the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group ( CECOG ) , AIO KRK-0104 or AIO KRK-0306 trials . RESULTS Patients with KRAS codon 12 mutant mCRC showed a broad range of outcome when treated with cetuximab-based first-line regimens . Patients with tumors bearing a KRAS p.G12D mutation showed a strong trend to a more favorable outcome compared to other mutations ( overall survival 23.3 vs. 14-18 months ; hazard ratio 0.66 , range 0.43-1.03 ) . An interaction model illustrated that KRAS p.G12C was associated with unfavorable outcome when treated with oxaliplatin plus cetuximab . CONCLUSION The present analysis suggests that KRAS codon 12 mutation may not represent a homogeneous entity in mCRC when treated with cetuximab-based first-line therapy .
We examined how well the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) E6 oncogene can function in the absence of the E7 oncogene during the carcinogenic process in human keratinocytes using a common HPV variant strongly associated with cervical cancer : the Asian-American E6 variant ( AAE6 ) . This E6 variant is 20 times more frequently detected in cervical cancer than the prototype European E6 variant , as evidenced by independent epidemiological data . Using cell culture and cell-based functional assays , we assessed how this variant can perform crucial carcinogenesis steps compared to the prototype E6 variant . The ability to immortalize and transform primary human foreskin keratinocytes ( PHFKs ) to acquire resilient phenotypes and the ability to promote cell migration were evaluated . The immortalization capability was assayed based on population doublings , number of passages , surpassing mortality stages 1 and 2 , human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) expression , and the ability to overcome G(1) arrest via p53 degradation . Transformation and migration efficiency were analyzed using a combination of functional cell-based assays . We observed that either AAE6 or prototype E6 proteins alone were sufficient to immortalize PHFKs , although AAE6 was more potent in doing so . The AAE6 variant protein alone pushed PHFKs through transformation and significantly increased their migration ability over that of the E6 prototype . Our findings are in line with epidemiological data that the AA variant of HPV16 confers an increased risk over the European prototype for cervical cancer , as evidenced by a superior immortalization , transformation , and metastatic potential .
Biallelic mutations in MCPH1 cause primary microcephaly ( MCPH ) with the cellular phenotype of defective chromosome condensation . MCPH1 encodes a multifunctional protein that notably is involved in brain development , regulation of chromosome condensation , and DNA damage response . In the present studies , we detected that MCPH1 encodes several distinct transcripts , including two major forms : full-length MCPH1 ( MCPH1-FL ) and a second transcript lacking the six 3 ' exons ( MCPH1\u0394e9-14 ) . Both variants show comparable tissue-specific expression patterns , demonstrate nuclear localization that is mediated independently via separate NLS motifs , and are more abundant in certain fetal than adult organs . In addition , the expression of either isoform complements the chromosome condensation defect found in genetically MCPH1-deficient or MCPH1 siRNA-depleted cells , demonstrating a redundancy of both MCPH1 isoforms for the regulation of chromosome condensation . Strikingly however , both transcripts are regulated antagonistically during cell-cycle progression and there are functional differences between the isoforms with regard to the DNA damage response ; MCPH1-FL localizes to phosphorylated H2AX repair foci following ionizing irradiation , while MCPH1\u0394e9-14 was evenly distributed in the nucleus . In summary , our results demonstrate here that MCPH1 encodes different isoforms that are differentially regulated at the transcript level and have different functions at the protein level .
BACKGROUND Chemokines are involved in multiple aspects of pathogenesis and cellular trafficking in tumorigenesis . In this study , we report that the latest member of the C-X-C-type chemokines , CXCL17 ( DMC/VCC-1 ) , recruits immature myeloid-derived cells and enhances early tumor progression . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS CXCL17 was preferentially expressed in some aggressive types of gastrointestinal , breast , and lung cancer cells . CXCL17 expression did not impart NIH3T3 cells with oncogenic potential in vitro , but CXCL17-expressing NIH3T3 cells could form vasculature-rich tumors in immunodeficient mice . Our data showed that CXCL17-expressing tumor cells increased immature CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid-derived cells at tumor sites in mice and promoted CD31(+) tumor angiogenesis . Extensive chemotactic assays proved that CXCL17-responding cells were CD11b(+)Gr1(high)F4/80(-) cells ( =~ 90% ) with a neutrophil-like morphology in vitro . Although CXCL17 expression could not increase the number of CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cells in tumor-burdened SCID mice or promote metastases of low metastatic colon cancer cells , the existence of CXCL17-responding myeloid-derived cells caused a striking enhancement of xenograft tumor formation . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These results suggest that aberrant expression of CXCL17 in tumor cells recruits immature myeloid-derived cells and promotes tumor progression through angiogenesis .
Activating K-RAS mutations occur at a frequency of 90% in pancreatic cancer , and to date no therapies exist targeting this oncogene . K-RAS signals via downstream effector pathways such as the MAPK and the PI3K signaling pathways , and much effort has been focused on developing drugs targeting components of these pathways . To better understand the requirements for K-RAS and its downstream signaling pathways MAPK and PI3K in pancreatic tumor maintenance , we established an inducible K-RAS knock down system that allowed us to ablate K-RAS in established tumors . Knock down of K-RAS resulted in impaired tumor growth in all pancreatic xenograft models tested , demonstrating that K-RAS expression is indeed required for tumor maintenance of K-RAS mutant pancreatic tumors . We further examined signaling downstream of K-RAS , and detected a robust reduction of pERK levels upon K-RAS knock down . In contrast , no effect on pAKT levels could be observed due to almost undetectable basal expression levels . To investigate the requirement of the MAPK and the PI3K pathways on tumor maintenance , three selected pancreatic xenograft models were tested for their response to MEK or PI3K inhibition . Tumors of all three models regressed upon MEK inhibition , but showed less pronounced response to PI3K inhibition . The effect of MEK inhibition on pancreatic xenografts could be enhanced further by combined application of a PI3K inhibitor . These data provide further rationale for testing combinations of MEK and PI3K inhibitors in clinical trials comprising a patient population with pancreatic cancer harboring mutations in K-RAS .
UNLABELLED BACKGROUND We aimed to develop a mouse spontaneous liver metastasis model from an orthotopically implanted human colon cancer cell line stably expressing a human sodium/iodide symporter ( NIS ) reporter gene , which can be imaged with single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) using 99mTcO4- . METHODS A recombinant plasmid containing a constitutively driven NIS gene ( pcDNA3-NIS ) was transfected into the human colon cancer cell line HCT116 , and stable cell lines were established . The stable cells were subcutaneously injected into the nude mice . When the diameter reached 10 mm , the xenografts were excised , cut into small fragments , and orthotopically implanted into the cecal walls of another nude mice. 99mTcO4- SPECT/CT imaging was initiated 8 weeks later and repeated every 1 to 2 weeks . RESULTS The production and function of NIS protein was confirmed in vitro by Western blotting and 99mTcO4- uptake assay . On SPECT/CT imaging , focal 99mTcO4- uptake was detected in the liver . Necropsy revealed local growth of the orthotopic colon xenografts with extensive invasion , microscopic serosal metastasis , and metastatic foci in the corresponding hepatic regions showing focal 99mTcO4- uptake . Immunohistochemistry revealed high levels of NIS expression in cells forming liver tumor , indicating that the liver tumor cells originated from the orthotopic colon xenografts . CONCLUSIONS The present proof-of-concept study provided a rationale for employing a radionuclide reporter gene for the specific visualization of spontaneous liver metastasis in living mice . This unique animal model of clinically relevant and externally detectable liver metastasis will be a powerful tool for investigating tumor biology and developing novel therapies for cancer metastasis .
The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a member of the HER family receptors and its activation induced by its natural ligand EGF results in colon cancer growth and progression . Panitumumab ( pmAb ) is a fully human IgG2 anti-EGFR antibody that blocks the EGFR actions . In the present study , we evaluated the effects of pmAb on the EGF-mediated cellular responses in a panel of colon cancer cells ( HCT-8 , HT-29 , DLD-1 and HCT-116 ) . HCT-1116 and DLD-1 cells showed no significant EGF-dependent cell proliferation ; HT-29 and HCT-8 exhibited an EGF-dependent proliferation , with HCT-8 cells to be the most responsive with significant EGFR phosphorylation upon treatment with EGF . The effects of pmAb were then evaluated in the most EGF-responsive cells , HCT-8 . In that respect , pmAb impedes the signaling cascade mediated by EGFR intracellular phosphorylation and activity of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) as well as the EGF-induced invasive and migratory potential of colon cancer cells . At the level of matrix effectors implicated in colon cancer progression we report that pmAb is a potent inhibitor of constitute and EGF-mediated gene expression of certain matrix effectors , such as membrane-type 1 metalloproteinase ( MT1-MMP ) , extracellular metalloproteinases inducer ( EMMPRIN ) , urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and syndecan-4 . The obtained data demonstrated that pmAb is a specific blocker of EGF-mediated EGFR activation , resulting in a significant inhibition of colon cancer cell proliferation in early stages of growth , migration and invasiveness as well as of matrix effector implicated in cancer progression .
Leishmaniasis is one of the major tropical parasitic diseases , and the condition ranges in severity from self-healing cutaneous lesions to fatal visceral manifestations . There is no vaccine available against visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) ( also known as kala-azar in India ) , and current antileishmanial drugs face major drawbacks , including drug resistance , variable efficacy , toxicity and parenteral administration . We report here that n-hexane fractions of Artemisia annua leaves ( AAL ) and seeds ( AAS ) possess significant antileishmanial activity against Leishmania donovani promastigotes , with GI(50) of 14.4 and 14.6 microg ml(-1) , respectively , and the IC(50) against intracellular amastigotes was found to be 6.6 and 5.05 microg ml(-1) , respectively . Changes in the morphology of promastigotes and growth reversibility analysis following treatment confirmed the leishmanicidal effect of the active fractions , which presented no cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells . The antileishmanial activity was mediated via apoptosis , as evidenced by externalization of phosphatidylserine , in situ labelling of DNA fragments by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling ( TUNEL ) and cell-cycle arrest at the sub-G(0)/G(1) phase . High-performance thin-layer chromatography ( HPTLC ) fingerprinting showed that the content of artemisinin in crude bioactive extracts ( microg per 100 microg n-hexane fraction ) was too low to account for the observed antileishmanial activity . Characterization of the active constituents by GC-MS showed that \u03b1-amyrinyl acetate , \u03b2-amyrine and derivatives of artemisinin were the major constituents in AAL and cetin , EINECS 211-126-2 and artemisinin derivatives in AAS . Our findings indicate the presence of antileishmanial compounds besides artemisinin in the n-hexane fractions of A. annua leaves and seeds .
Cold atmospheric plasma ( CAP ) , a technology based on quasi-neutral ionized gas at low temperatures , is currently being evaluated as a new highly selective alternative addition to existing cancer therapies . Here , we present a first attempt to identify the mechanism of CAP action . CAP induced a robust G2/M increase in two different types of cancer cells with different degrees of tumorigenicity . We hypothesize that the increased sensitivity of cancer cells to CAP treatment is caused by differences in the distribution of cancer cells and normal cells within the cell cycle . The expression of gammaH2A.X ( pSer139 ) , an oxidative stress reporter indicating S-phase damage , is enhanced specifically within CAP treated cells in the S phase of the cell cycle . Together with a significant decrease in EdU-incorporation after CAP , these data suggest that tumorigenic cancer cells are more susceptible to CAP treatment .
\u03b1-Tropomyosin ( \u03b1Tm ) is central to Ca(2+)-regulation of cardiac muscle contraction . The familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation \u03b1Tm E180G enhances Ca(2+)-sensitivity in functional assays . To investigate the molecular basis , we imaged single molecules of human cardiac \u03b1Tm E180G by direct probe atomic force microscopy . Analyses of tangent angles along molecular contours yielded persistence length corresponding to increase in flexibility compared to wild-type . Increased flexibility of the mutant was confirmed by fitting end-to-end length distributions to the worm-like chain model . This marked increase in flexibility can significantly impact systolic and possibly diastolic phases of cardiac contraction , ultimately leading to hypertrophy .
The effect of acute intense intermittent exercise compared with moderate-intensity exercise on angiogenic factors and the effect of 4 weeks of intense intermittent training on capillary growth were examined in nine healthy young men , preconditioned by moderate-intensity endurance training . The intense training consisted of 24 bouts of 1 min cycling at an initial work rate of 316 +/- 19 W ( of pretraining maximal oxygen uptake ) , performed three times per week . Skeletal muscle biopsies and muscle microdialysates were obtained from the vastus lateralis before , during and after acute exercise performed at either moderate or high intensity . Comparison of the response in angiogenic factors to acute moderate- versus high-intensity exercise , performed prior to the intense training intervention , revealed that intense exercise resulted in a markedly lower ( P < 0.05 ) increase in interstitial vascular endothelial growth factor than did moderate-intensity exercise . Muscle interstitial fluid obtained during moderate-intensity exercise increased endothelial cell proliferation in vitro more than interstitial fluid obtained during intense exercise ( sixfold versus 2.5-fold , respectively ; P < 0.05 ) . The 4 weeks of high-intensity training did not lead to an increased capillarization in the muscle but abolished the exercise-induced increase in mRNA for several angiogenic factors , increased the protein levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase , lowered the protein levels of thrombospondin-1 in muscle but increased the interstitial protein levels of thrombospondin-1 . We conclude that intense intermittent exercise provides a weak stimulus for vascular endothelial growth factor secretion and endothelial cell proliferation and that intense intermittent training does not induce a sufficient angiogenic stimulus to induce capillary growth in muscle previously conditioned by moderate-intensity exercise .
OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in cervical squamous carcinoma . METHODS Eighty cases of invasive cervical squamous cancer were selected as objects of our study . Double immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 and Ki-67 was used to label the lymphatic vessels and mark the proliferative lymphatic vessels in cervical squamous cancer . The peritumoral lymphatic vessel density and intratumoral lymphatic vessel density was assessed . The lymphatic vessels proliferation index was evaluated by calculating Ki-67 proliferation index ( PI ) to reflect the lymphangiogenesis of cervical squamous cancer . Then the correlation between lymphangiogenesis and clinicopathologic features of cervical squamous cancer was analyzed . RESULTS The LVD of cervical cancer ( 15.23 <FFFD> 3.6 ) was clearly higher than that of the adjacent normal cervical subepithelial tissues ( 9.9 <FFFD> 2.5 , P < 0.001 ) . The peritumoral lymphatic vessel density of cervical cancer ( 18.75 <FFFD> 4.3 ) was significantly higher than the intratumoral lymphatic vessel density of cervical cancer ( 11.71 <FFFD> 4.9 , P < 0.001 ) . Lymphatic PI ( LPI ) of cervical cancer ( 0.258 <FFFD> 0.07 ) was higher than that of the adjacent normal cervical subepithelial tissues ( 0.068 <FFFD> 0.08 , P < 0.001 ) . The peritumoral lymphatic vessel PI of cervical cancer ( 0.324 <FFFD> 0.06 ) was notably higher than the intratumoral lymphatic vessel PI of cervical cancer ( 0.232 <FFFD> 0.06 , P < 0.001 ) . Peritumoral lymphatic vessel density and peritumoral lymphatic vessel were clearly associated with the lymph node metastasis ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.002 , respectively ) and lymphovascular space invasion ( P = 0.024 and P = 0.01 , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS The high density of peritumoral lymphatic vessels is a potential predictor of more aggressive phenotype of cervical squamous cancer .
RASSF2 has recently been identified as a potential tumor suppressor that serves as a Ras effector in various types of human cancers . However , there have been few reports detailing this in gastric cancer . Samples of gastric adenocarcinoma from 276 Chinese patients with follow-up were analyzed for RASSF2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry . RASSF2 was expressed in up to 31.2% ( 86/276 ) of this group of gastric carcinoma . The expression of RASSF2 was significantly lower in carcinomas than in normal mucosas ( P<0.05 ) . RASSF2 corresponded positively with patient age , histological differentiation , depth of tumor invasion , regional lymph node and distant metastasis , and TNM stage ( all P<0.05 ) . Further multivariate analysis revealed that patient gender , depth of tumor invasion , distant metastasis , TNM stage and the expression of RASSF2 were independent prognostic factors for patients with gastric cancer . The Kaplan-Meier plot showed that the overall mean survival time of the patients with RASSF2-negative expression was shorter than that of patients with positive expression ( chi(2)=156.874 , P<0.0001 ) . Moreover , RASSF2-negative expression had a much more significant effect on the survival of those patients with early stage tumors ( chi(2)=127.167 , P<0.0001 ) , highlighted by a >50.9% reduction in 3-year survival compared to that of patients with RASSF2-positive expression . In late stages , the difference was also significant ( chi(2)=6.246 , P=0.019 ) , with a 35.5% reduction in 3-year survival . It is suggested that RASSF2 plays an important role in the evolution of gastric adenocarcinoma and should be considered as a potential marker for its prognosis .
Cellular senescence can be a functional barrier to carcinogenesis . We hypothesized that inflammation modulates carcinogenesis through senescence and DNA damage response ( DDR ) . We examined the association between senescence and DDR with macrophage levels in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . In vitro experiments tested the ability of macrophages to induce senescence in primary cells . Inflammation modulating microRNAs were identified in senescence colon tissue for further investigation .
Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is classically illustrated by a desynchronized cytokine system with rise in inflammatory cytokines . There are recent reports which emphasized the potential role of angiogenesis in the development of MM. Role of cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX-2 ) is well documented in the pathogenesis of solid tumors , but little is known about its occurrence and function in hematologic neoplasms . Involvement of neoangiogenesis is reported in the progression of MM , and angiopoietins probably contribute to this progression by enhancing neovascularization . Circulatory and mRNA levels of angiogenic factors and cyclooxygenase were determined in 125 subjects ( 75 MM patients and 50 healthy controls ) by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative PCR . We observed significant increase for angiogenic factors ( Ang-1 , Ang-2 , hepatocyte growth factor , and vascular endothelial growth factor ) and cyclooxygenase at circulatory level , as well as at mRNA level , as compared to healthy controls except insignificant increase for Ang-1 at circulatory level . We have also observed the significant positive correlation of all angiogenic factors with cyclooxygenase . The strong association found between angiogenic factors and COX-2 in this study may lead to the development of combination therapeutic strategy to treat MM. Therefore , targeting COX-2 by using its effective inhibitors demonstrating antiangiogenic and antitumor effects could be used as a new therapeutic approach for treatment of MM .
MAP17 is a small 17 kDa non-glycosylated membrane protein previously identified as being overexpressed in carcinomas . Breast tumor cells that overexpress MAP17 show an increased tumoral phenotype with enhanced proliferative capabilities both in the presence or the absence of contact inhibition , decreased apoptotic sensitivity , and increased migration . MAP17-expressing clones also grow better in nude mice . The increased malignant cell behavior induced by MAP17 is associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , and the treatment of MAP17-expressing cells with antioxidants results in a reduction in the tumorigenic properties of these cells . The MAP17-dependent increase in ROS and tumorigenesis relies on its PDZ-binding domain because disruption of this sequence by point mutations abolishes the ability of MAP17 to enhance ROS production and tumorigenesis . MAP17 is overexpressed in a great variety of human carcinomas , including breast tumors . Immunohistochemical analysis of MAP17 during cancer progression demonstrates that overexpression of the protein strongly correlates with tumoral progression . Generalized MAP17 overexpression in human carcinomas indicates that MAP17 can be a good marker for tumorigenesis and , especially , for malignant progression .
BACKGROUND Coronins are a family of highly evolutionary conserved proteins reportedly involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics , although only coronin 3 has been shown to be related to cancer cell migration . In glioblastoma cells , the knockdown of coronin 3 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion . Coronin 3 is also associated with the aggression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma . In this paper , we analyze the migration , invasion and metastasis abilities of gastric cancer cells after up- or down-regulation of coronin 3 , and explore the mechanism of coronin 3 in the process of gastric cancer metastasis . RESULTS The expression of coronin 3 was higher in the highly metastatic sub-cell line MKN28-M , which we established in our laboratory . We also demonstrated that the expression of coronin 3 was remarkably higher in lymph lode metastases than in primary gastric cancer tissues , and over-expression of coronin 3 was correlated with the increased clinical stage and lymph lode metastasis . Recombinant lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs were designed to down-regulate coronin 3 expression in gastric cancer cell lines . Stable knockdown of coronin 3 by this lentiviral vector could efficiently inhibit the migration and invasion of MKN45 gastric cancer cells . In contrast , up-regulation of coronin 3 significantly enhanced migration and invasion of MKN28-NM cells . In addition , knockdown of coronin 3 significantly reduced liver metastasis in mice after tail vein injection of gastric cancer cells . The Human Tumor Metastasis PCR Array was used to screen the metastasis-associated genes identified by the down-regulation of coronin 3 , and the results suggested that , following the knockdown of coronin 3 , the tumor cell migration and invasion were inhibited by the reduced expression of MMP-9 and cathepsin K. CONCLUSION Coronin 3 is highly expressed in gastric cancer metastases and can promote the metastatic behaviors of gastric cancer cells , including their migration and invasion .
Immunosenescence , the progressive decline of adaptive immunity and chronic inflammation with ageing has been demonstrated to be the main factor responsible for infections , cancer and autoimmune conditions in the elderly . Senescence-accelerated mouse ( SAM ) was used to study the protective effects of Pu-erh tea in the elderly . The senile-prone sub-strain , SAM-P8 mice were administered individually with ripened or crude Pu-erh tea at 125 , 250 or 500mg/kg . The results showed that Pu-erh tea significantly increased the fractions of na<FFFD>ve T lymphocytes , CD8(+)CD28(+) T lymphocytes and NK cells in the peripheral blood , but decreased the levels of IL-6 in aged mice . These data suggested that the Pu-erh tea reversed the immunosenescence by restoring the immune deficiency and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine . Thus , long term drinking of Pu-erh tea may be beneficial for the aged population in terms of increasing the body's resistance to infection and cancer .
It is well established that aberrant production of inflammatory mediators has been associated with most the toxic manifestations and the genesis of different chronic diseases including cancer . The basic aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of soy isoflavones ( SIF ) on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-induced cutaneous inflammatory responses and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms . We have studied the protective effects of SIF against TPA induced oxidative stress , pro-inflammatory cytokines level , activation of NF-kappaB , expression of COX-2 and ki-67 in mouse skin . Animals were divided into five groups I-V ( n=6 ) . Groups II , III and IV received topical application of TPA at the dose of 10 nmol/0.2 ml of acetone/animal/day , for 2 days . Animals of the groups III and IV were pre-treated with SIF 1.0 mug ( D1 ) and 2.0 mug ( D2 ) topically 30 min prior to each TPA administration , while groups I and V were given acetone ( 0.2 ml ) and SIF ( D2 ) , respectively . We have found that SIF pretreatment significantly inhibited TPA induced oxidative stress , proinflammatory cytokines production and activation of NF-kappaB . SIF also inhibited the expression of COX-2 and ki-67 . Histological findings further supported the protective effects of SIF against TPA-induced cutaneous damage . Thus , our results suggest that inhibitory effect of SIF on TPA-induced cutaneous inflammation includes inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines , attenuation of oxidative stress , activation of NF-kappaB and expression of COX-2 .
Contact inhibition is a crucial mechanism regulating proliferation in vitro and in vivo . Although it is generally accepted that contact inhibition plays a pivotal role in maintaining tissue homeostasis , the molecular mechanisms of contact inhibition are still not fully understood . FoxM1 is known as a proliferation-associated transcription factor and is upregulated in many cancer types . Vice versa , anti-proliferative signals , such as TGF-\u03b2 and differentiation signals decrease FoxM1 expression . Here we investigated the role of FoxM1 in contact inhibition in fibroblasts . We show that protein expression of FoxM1 is severely and rapidly downregulated upon contact inhibition , probably by inhibition of ERK activity , which then leads to decreased expression of cyclin A and polo-like kinase 1 . Vice versa , ectopic expression of FoxM1 prevents the decrease in cyclin A and polo-like kinase 1 and causes a two-fold increase in saturation density indicating loss of contact inhibition . Hence , we show that downregulation of FoxM1 is required for contact inhibition by regulating expression of cyclin A and polo-like kinase 1 .
AIM To investigate whether luteolin , a highly prevalent flavonoid , reverses the effects of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) in vitro and in vivo and to determine the mechanisms underlying this reversal . METHODS Murine malignant melanoma B16F10 cells were exposed to 1% O(2) for 24 h . Cellular mobility and adhesion were assessed using Boyden chamber transwell assay and cell adhesion assay , respectively . EMT-related proteins , such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin , were examined using Western blotting . Female C57BL/6 mice ( 6 to 8 weeks old ) were injected with B16F10 cells ( 1<FFFD>10(6) cells in 0.2 mL per mouse ) via the lateral tail vein . The mice were treated with luteolin ( 10 or 20 mg/kg , ip ) daily for 23 d . On the 23rd day after tumor injection , the mice were sacrificed , and the lungs were collected , and metastatic foci in the lung surfaces were photographed . Tissue sections were analyzed with immunohistochemistry and HE staining . RESULTS Hypoxia changed the morphology of B16F10 cells in vitro from the cobblestone-like to mesenchymal-like strips , which was accompanied by increased cellular adhesion and invasion . Luteolin ( 5-50 mumol/L ) suppressed the hypoxia-induced changes in the cells in a dose-dependent manner . Hypoxia significantly decreased the expression of E-cadherin while increased the expression of N-cadherin in the cells ( indicating the occurrence of EMT-like transformation ) , which was reversed by luteolin ( 5 mumol/L ) . In B16F10 cells , luteolin up-regulated E-cadherin at least partly via inhibiting the beta3 integrin/FAK signal pathway . In experimental metastasis model mice , treatment with luteolin ( 10 or 20 mg/kg ) reduced metastatic colonization in the lungs by 50% . Furthermore , the treatment increased the expression of E-cadherin while reduced the expression of vimentin and beta3 integrin in the tumor tissues . CONCLUSION Luteolin inhibits the hypoxia-induced EMT in malignant melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo via the regulation of beta3 integrin , suggesting that luteolin may be applied as a potential anticancer chemopreventative and chemotherapeutic agent .
Exosomes are small-membrane vesicles secreted by hematopoietic and malignant epithelial cells as well as trophoblasts . The composition of cancerous exosomes has been proven to play pivotal roles in the maintenance of the microenvironment that is beneficial for the progression of cancer , such as Fas-ligand-triggered lymphocyte apoptosis . We supposed that the immunosuppressive effect of cancerous exosomes might be helpful in the treatment of diseases characterized by overactivation of the immune system and subsequent tissue injury . The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of tumor-derived exosomes in the mice model of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)-induced inflammation . Tetrazolium ( MTT ) and DNA electrophoresis were used to measure the cytotoxicity of exosomes on lymphocytes . Pathologic observation of tissue sections , serologic analysis of aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ( AST/ALT ) , and urinary analysis of protein were used to assess the protection effect of exosomes in LPS-induced multiorgan damage . In vitro outcomes of MTT and DNA electrophoresis showed the cytotoxicity of exosomes on lymphocytes . Together with the alleviation of organ damages evaluated by urine protein , serum AST/ALT , and pathologic analysis , we confirmed the possibility that pretreatment of mice with exosomes , produced by H22 hepatic tumor cells , resulted in protection against LPS-induced tissue damage , which is caused by overactivation of the immune system and inflammation response . This therapeutic strategy will raise an interesting way to search new therapeutics in pairs of diseases with complementarities in etiology and pathology , namely , a strategy of taking advantage of the mutual complementarities between diseases .
p21 is a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that plays a role in promoting G1 cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence . Consistent with this role , p21 is a downstream target of several tumour suppressors and oncogenes , and it is downregulated in the majority of tumours , including breast cancer . Here , we report that protein arginine methyltransferase 6 ( PRMT6 ) , a type I PRMT known to act as a transcriptional cofactor , directly represses the p21 promoter . PRMT6 knock-down ( KD ) results in a p21 derepression in breast cancer cells , which is p53-independent , and leads to cell cycle arrest , cellular senescence and reduced growth in soft agar assays and in severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) mice for all the cancer lines examined . We finally show that bypassing the p21-mediated arrest rescues PRMT6 KD cells from senescence , and it restores their ability to grow on soft agar . We conclude that PRMT6 acts as an oncogene in breast cancer cells , promoting growth and preventing senescence , making it an attractive target for cancer therapy .
Some people consume chronically glutamine ( GLN ) in high quantities ( g/d ) , although a number of biochemical pathways and cellular functions may be negatively affected . The following side effects of GLN supplementation are discussed : ( 1 ) Alterations in amino acid transport-as GLN shares the transporters with other amino acids , enhanced GLN intake may impair amino acid distribution among tissues and their absorption in the gut and kidneys . ( 2 ) Alterations in GLN metabolism-GLN supplementation may impair synthesis of endogenous GLN and enhance glutamate and ammonia production . ( 3 ) Alterations in ammonia transport-GLN supplementation may impair ammonia detoxification and negatively affect the role of GLN as the carrier of ammonia among tissues . ( 4 ) Abnormalities in aminoacidemia-increased plasma levels of GLN , glutamate , citrulline , ornithine , arginine , and histidine and decreased levels of valine , leucine , isoleucine , glycine , threonine , serine , and proline are reported . ( 5 ) Alterations in immune system-as GLN has immunomodulating properties , the effect of chronic GLN consumption on the immune system needs to be assessed . ( 6 ) Effect on tumor growth-it should be elucidated whether chronic intake of GLN increases the risk of cancer . ( 7 ) Effect of the withdrawal of GLN supplementation-due to the adaptive response of the organism to enhanced GLN consumption , the withdrawal of GLN may enhance the risk of health problems resulting from GLN deficiency . It is concluded that enhanced intake of GLN has substantial side effects , and long-term studies should be performed to justify chronic consumption of a GLN-enriched diet .
UNLABELLED Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is a major liver malignancy . We previously demonstrated that deregulation of epigenetic regulators is a common event in human HCC . Suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 ( SUV39H1 ) , the prototype of histone methyltransferase , is the major enzyme responsible for histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation , which , essentially , is involved in heterochromatin formation , chromosome segregation , and mitotic progression . However , the implication of SUV39H1 in hepatocarcinogenesis remains elusive . In this study , we found that SUV39H1 was frequently up-regulated in human HCCs and was significantly associated with increased Ki67 expression ( P < 0.001 ) and the presence of venous invasion ( P = 0.017 ) . To investigate the role of SUV39H1 in HCC development , both gain- and loss-of-function models were established . SUV39H1 overexpression remarkably enhanced HCC cell clonogenicity , whereas knockdown of SUV39H1 substantially suppressed HCC cell proliferation and induced cell senescence . In addition , ectopic expression of SUV39H1 increased the migratory ability of HCC cells , whereas a reduced migration rate was observed in SUV39H1 knockdown cells . The significance of SUV39H1 in HCC was further demonstrated in a nude mice model ; SUV39H1 knockdown drastically inhibited in vivo tumorigenicity and abolished pulmonary metastasis of HCC cells . We also identified microRNA-125b ( miR-125b ) as a post-transcriptional regulator of SUV39H1 . Ectopic expression of miR-125b inhibited SUV39H1 3'-untranslated-region-coupled luciferase activity and suppressed endogenous SUV39H1 expression at both messenger RNA and protein levels . We have previously reported frequent down-regulation of miR-125b in HCC . Interestingly , miR-125b level was found to be inversely correlated with SUV39H1 expression ( P = 0.001 ) in clinical specimens . Our observations suggested that miR-125b down-regulation may account for the aberrant SUV39H1 level in HCC . CONCLUSION Our study demonstrated that SUV39H1 up-regulation contributed to HCC development and metastasis . The tumor-suppressive miR-125b served as a negative regulator of SUV39H1 .
Chronic inflammation is a risk factor for the development of colon cancer , providing genotoxic insults , growth and pro-angiogenic factors that can promote tumorigenesis and tumor growth . Immunomodulatory agents can interfere with the inflammation that feeds cancer , but their impact on the transformed cell is poorly understood . The calcium/calcineurin signaling pathway , through activation of NFAT , is essential for effective immune responses , and its inhibitors cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 are used in the clinics to suppress immunity . Moreover , the kinases GSK3beta and mTOR , modulated by PI-3K/Akt , can inhibit NFAT activity , suggesting a cross-talk between the calcium and growth factor signaling pathways . Both NFAT and mTOR activity have been associated with tumorigenesis . We therefore investigated the impact of calcineurin and PI-3K/mTOR inhibition in growth of human colon carcinoma cells . We show that despite the efficient inhibition of NFAT1 activity , FK506 promotes tumor growth , whereas CsA inhibits it due to a delay in cell cycle progression and induction of necroptosis . We found NFkappaB activation and mTORC1 activity not to be altered by CsA or FK506 . Similarly , changes to mitochondrial homeostasis were equivalent upon treatment with these drugs . We further show that , in our model , NFAT1 activation is not modulated by PI3K/mTOR . We conclude that CsA slows cell cycle progression and induces necroptosis of human carcinoma cell lines in a TGFbeta- , NFAT- , NFkappaB- and PI3K/mTOR-independent fashion . Nevertheless , our data suggest that CsA , in addition to its anti-inflammatory capacity , may target transformed colon and esophagus carcinoma cells without affecting non-transformed cells , promoting beneficial tumoristatic effects .
PURPOSE To develop PEGylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes as a sustained release drug delivery system . METHODS Oxaliplatin was incorporated into inner cavity of PEGylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNT-PEG ) using nano-extraction . Oxaliplatin release rates from MWCNT-PEG-Oxaliplatin were investigated using dialysis tubing . Cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin , MWCNT-Oxaliplatin and MWCNT-PEG-Oxaliplatin were evaluated in HT29 cell by MTT assay , Pt-DNA adducts formation , \u03b3-H2AX formation and cell apoptosis assay . RESULTS Loading of oxaliplatin into MWCNT-PEG was Sustained release occurred to MWCNT-PEG-Oxaliplatin , with only 34% of oxaliplatin released into medium within 6h . In MTT assay , MWCNT-PEG-Oxaliplatin showed slightly decreased cytotoxic effect when cell viability was assessed at 12 and 24h . A drastic increase of cytotoxicity was found when cell viability was assessed at 48 and 96h . Pt-DNA adducts formation , \u03b3-H2AX formation and cell apoptosis assay results showed the same trend as the MTT assay , suggesting sustained-release for MWCNT-Oxaliplatin and MWCNT-PEG-Oxaliplatin formulations . CONCLUSIONS PEGylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes can be used as sustained release drug delivery system , thus remarkably improving cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin on HT-29 cells .
ABSTRACT : INTRODUCTION : Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation steps in the process of breast cancer metastasis , the primary cause of breast cancer morbidity and death . Here we investigated the role of p21Cip1 ( p21 ) , a member of the core cell cycle machinery , in transforming growth factor-beta ( TGFbeta)-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion . METHODS : A mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model was used to assess the mammary tumor growth and local invasion . The triple negative human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231 and its sub-progenies SCP2 and SCP25 , SUM159PT , SUM149PT , SUM229PE and SUM1315MO2 were treated with 5 ng/ml TGFbeta and the protein expression levels were measured by Western blot . Cell migration and invasion were examined using the scratch/wound healing and Transwell assay . TGFbeta transcriptional activity was measured by a TGFbeta/Smad reporter construct ( CAGA12-luc ) using luciferase assay. q-PCR was used for assessing TGFbeta downstream target genes . The interactions among p21 , p/CAF and Smad3 were performed by co-immunoprecipitation . In addition , Smad3 on DNA binding ability was measured by DNA immunoprecipitation using biotinylated Smad binding element DNA probes . Finally , the association among active TGFbeta/Smad signaling , p21 and p/CAF with lymph node metastasis was examined by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarray containing 50 invasive ductal breast tumors , 25 of which are lymph node positive . RESULTS : We found p21 expression to correlate with poor overall and distant metastasis free survival in breast cancer patients . Furthermore , using xenograft animal models and in vitro studies , we found p21 to be essential for tumor cell invasion . The invasive effects of p21 were found to correlate with Smad3 , and p/CAF interaction downstream of TGFbeta. p21 and p/CAF regulates TGFbeta-mediated transcription of pro-metastatic genes by controlling Smad3 acetylation , DNA binding and transcriptional activity . In addition , we found that active TGFbeta/Smad signaling correlates with high p21 and p/CAF expression levels and lymph node involvement using tissue microarrays from breast cancer patients . CONCLUSIONS : Together these results highlight an important role for p21 and p/CAF in promoting breast cancer cell migration and invasion at the transcriptional level and may open new avenues for breast cancer therapy .
OBJECTIVE To construct the eukaryotic expression vector for Max interacting protein 1 ( Mxi1 ) . METHODS The full length cDNA of Mxi1 gene obtained from fetal lymphocyte and KG1 cells were inserted into plasmid pDs-red2-N1 respectively to generate pDs-red2-N1/Mri1 ( wild/mutation type ) . Then the recombinant vector was transfected into Cos-7 cells via liposome. 48 hours post transfection , mRNA of Mri1 gene was detected by RT-PCR and Mxi1 protein expression was detected by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscope in the Cos-7 cells . RESULTS The eukaryotic expression vector of Mxi1 was constructed and transfected into eukaryotic cells successfully . The expression of red fluorescence protein in the transfected Cos-7 cells was observed under fluorescence microscope which implied the expression of Mxi1 . The transfect efficiency of both wild and mutation type were in a high level in 3 days after transfected , which lasted to 6 d . RT-PCR amplified the total RNA extracted from the transfected Cos-7 cells could find increased mRNA level of Mxi1 gene . CONCLUSION We successfully constructed the eukaryote expression vector for Mri1 gene ; Cos-7 cells transfected with the vector via liposome could express Mxi1 protein . These could be useful for the further study of the Myc gene modulation .
AIM To assess the prognostic significance of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and its target genes in gastric cancer . METHODS The tumor tissues of 115 patients with gastric cancer were immunohistochemically evaluated using monoclonal antibodies against NF-kappaB RelA . Preoperative serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) were assessed via enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay . C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and serum amyloid A ( SAA ) were measured via immunotrubidimetry . RESULTS Positive rate of NF-kappaB RelA was 42.6% . NF-kappaB RelA expression in tumor tissues was also related to serum levels of IL-6 ( P = 0.044 ) and CRP ( P = 0.010 ) . IL-6 , SAA , CRP were related to depth of invasion , VEGF and SAA were correlated with lymph node metastasis . IL-6 , VEGF , SAA and CRP were related to the stage . Univariate analysis demonstrated that immunostaining of NF-kappaB RelA , levels of IL-6 , VEGF , SAA were significantly related with both disease free survival and overall survival ( OS ) . Multivariate analysis verified that NF-kappaB RelA [ hazard ratio ( HR ) : 3.40 , P = 0.024 ] and SAA ( HR : 3.39 , P = 0.045 ) were independently associated with OS . CONCLUSION Increased expression of NF-kappaB RelA and high levels of serum SAA were associated with poor OS in gastric cancer patients .
Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the most common primary malignant tumor that accounts for of all liver cancer cases worldwide . It is a multifactorial disease caused by a variety of risk factors and often develops in the background of underlying cirrhosis . A number of cellular phenomena , such as tumor microenvironment , inflammation , oxidative stress , and hypoxia act in concert with various molecular events to facilitate tumor initiation , progression , and metastasis . The emergence of microRNAs and molecular-targeted therapies adds a new dimension in our efforts to combat this deadly disease . Intense research in this multitude of areas has led to significant progress in our understanding of cellular processes and molecular mechanisms that occur during multistage events that lead to hepatocarcinogenesis . In this review , we discuss the current knowledge of HCC , focusing mainly on advances that have occurred during the past 5years and on the development of novel therapeutics for liver cancer .
Formononetin is a novel herbal isoflavonoid isolated from Astragalus membranaceus , a medicinal plant that possesses antitumorigenic properties . Our previous findings demonstrated that formononetin initiates growth-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic activities in human colon cancer cells . In the present study , we aimed to further examine the potential of formononetin in controlling angiogenesis and tumor cell invasiveness in human colon cancer cells and tumor xenografts . The results showed that formononetin downregulated the expression of the key pro-angiogenic factors , including vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and matrix metalloproteinases . We also discovered that the invasiveness of metastatic colon cancer cells was alleviated following drug treatment . The potential anti-angiogenic effect of formononetin was examined in nude mouse xenografts . The tumor size and the number of proliferating cells were reduced in the tumor tissues obtained from the formononetin-treated group . The serum VEGF level was also reduced in the drug-treated animals when compared to the controls . These findings suggest that formononetin inhibits angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion , and thus support its use in the treatment of advanced and metastatic colon cancers .
Advanced or metastatic prostate cancer is treated by androgen deprivation ; however , patients inevitably relapse with castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . CRPC remains dependent on androgen receptor ( AR ) signaling , which may include constitutive , ligand-independent action of naturally occurring AR splice variants . For example , the AR splice variant AR3 ( also termed AR-V7 ) is expressed in CRPC and is linked to poor prognosis . Vav3 , a Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor , is an AR coactivator that is up-regulated in human prostate cancer compared with benign tissue and in preclinical models of CRPC . Vav3 confers castration-resistant growth to androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cells . Despite the importance of AR coactivators in promoting CRPC , the potential role of these regulatory proteins in modulating AR splice variant activity is unknown . We examined the contributions of Vav3 to AR activity in two CRPC cell lines that naturally express relatively high levels of Vav3 and AR3 . Vav3 or AR3 knockdown greatly attenuated cell proliferation , soft agar growth , and ligand-independent AR activity . Vav3 potently enhanced the transcriptional activity of AR3 and another clinically relevant AR splice variant , ARv567es . Vav3 knockdown resulted in lowered nuclear AR3 levels , whereas total AR3 levels remained similar . Conversely , overexpression of Vav3 resulted in increased nuclear AR3 . Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that AR3 and Vav3 interact . These novel data demonstrating physical and functional interactions between Vav3 , a unique AR coactivator , and an AR splice variant provide insights into the mechanisms by which Vav3 exploits and enhances AR signaling in the progression to CRPC .
BACKGROUND Angiogenic factors following oncological surgery is important in tumor recurrence . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , angiopoietin 1 ( Ang-1 ) , Ang-2 , soluble VEGF-receptor 1 ( sVEGFR1 ) and sVEGFR2 may influence angiogenesis . This prospective study examined the influence of open and video-assisted thoracic surgery ( VATS ) lung resections for early stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) on postoperative circulating angiogenic factors . METHODS Forty-three consecutive patients underwent major lung resection through either VATS ( n = 23 ) or Open thoracotomy ( n = 20 ) over an 8-month period . Blood samples were collected preoperatively and postoperatively on days ( POD ) 1 and 3 for enzyme linked immunosorbent assay determination of angiogenic factors . RESULTS Patient demographics were comparable . For all patients undergoing major lung resection , postoperative Ang-1 and sVEGFR2 levels were significantly decreased , while Ang-2 and sVEGFR1 levels markedly increased . No significant peri-operative changes in VEGF levels were observed . Compared with open group , VATS had significantly lower plasma levels of VEGF ( VATS 170 +/- 93 pg/mL ; Open 486 +/- 641 pg/mL ; P = 0.04 ) and Ang-2 ( VATS 2484 +/- 1119 pg/mL ; Open 3379 +/- 1287 pg/mL ; P = 0.026 ) on POD3 . CONCLUSIONS Major lung resection for early stage NSCLC leads to a pro-angiogenic status , with increased Ang-2 and decreased Ang-1 productions . VATS is associated with an attenuated angiogenic response with lower circulating VEGF and Ang-2 levels compared with open . Such differences in angiogenic factors may be important in lung cancer biology and recurrence following surgery .
The complement system contributes to various immune and inflammatory diseases , including cancer . In this study , we investigated the capacity of lung cancer cells to activate complement and characterized the consequences of complement activation on tumor progression . We focused our study on the production and role of the anaphylatoxin C5a , a potent immune mediator generated after complement activation . We first measured the capacity of lung cancer cell lines to deposit C5 and release C5a . C5 deposition , after incubation with normal human serum , was higher in lung cancer cell lines than in nonmalignant bronchial epithelial cells . Notably , lung malignant cells produced complement C5a even in the absence of serum . We also found a significant increase of C5a in plasma from patients with non-small cell lung cancer , suggesting that the local production of C5a is followed by its systemic diffusion . The contribution of C5a to lung cancer growth in vivo was evaluated in the Lewis lung cancer model . Syngeneic tumors of 3LL cells grew slower in mice treated with an antagonist of the C5a receptor . C5a did not modify 3LL cell proliferation in vitro but induced endothelial cell chemotaxis and blood-vessels formation . C5a also contributed to the immunosuppressive microenvironment required for tumor growth . In particular , blockade of C5a receptor significantly reduced myeloid-derived suppressor cells and immunomodulators ARG1 , CTLA-4 , IL-6 , IL-10 , LAG3 , and PDL1 ( B7H1 ) . In conclusion , lung cancer cells have the capacity to generate C5a , a molecule that creates a favorable tumor microenvironment for lung cancer progression .
Metastasis is a complex process utilizing both tumor-cell-autonomous properties and host-derived factors , including cellular immunity . We have previously shown that germline polymorphisms can modify tumor cell metastatic capabilities through cell-autonomous mechanisms . However , how metastasis susceptibility genes interact with the tumor stroma is incompletely understood . Here , we employ a complex genetic screen to identify Cadm1 as a novel modifier of metastasis . We demonstrate that Cadm1 can specifically suppress metastasis without affecting primary tumor growth . Unexpectedly , Cadm1 did not alter tumor-cell-autonomous properties such as proliferation or invasion , but required the host's adaptive immune system to affect metastasis . The metastasis-suppressing effect of Cadm1 was lost in mice lacking T cell-mediated immunity , which was partially phenocopied by depleting CD8(+) T cells in immune-competent mice . Our data show a novel function for Cadm1 in suppressing metastasis by sensitizing tumor cells to immune surveillance mechanisms , and this is the first report of a heritable metastasis susceptibility gene engaging tumor non-autonomous factors .
It is known that sperm samples from recurrent pregnancy loss ( RPL ) couples have an increase in their sperm DNA fragmentation ( SDF ) , but no studies have been performed in order to identify differences between single stranded SDF ( ssSDF ) and double stranded SDF ( dsSDF ) in these patients . This could be relevant because the type of DNA damage could have different effects . Semen samples were classified attending their clinical status : 25 fertile donors and 20 RPL patients with at least two unexplained first trimester miscarriages . SDF was analysed using alkaline and neutral Comet assay , SCD test and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) , and ROC analysis including data from 105 more infertile patients ( n\u200a=\u200a150 ) was performed to establish predictive threshold values . SDF for alkaline and neutral Comet , and the SCD test was analysed in these categories of individuals . Data revealed the presence of two subgroups within fertile donors . The values obtained were 21.10+/-9.13 , 23.35+/-10.45 and 12.31+/-4.31 , respectively , for fertile donors with low values for both ssSDF and dsSDF ; 27.86+/-12.64 , 80.69+/-12.67 and 12.43+/-5.22 , for fertile donors with low ssSDF and high dsSDF ; and 33.61+/-15.50 , 84.64+/-11.28 and 19.28+/-6.05 , for unexplained RPL patients , also showing a low ssSDF and high dsSDF profile . This latter profile was seen in 85% of unexplained RPL and 33% of fertile donors , suggesting that it may be associated to a male risk factor for undergoing RPL . ROC analysis regarding recurrent miscarriage set the cut-off value at 77.50% of dsDNA SDF . PFGE for low ssSDF and high dsSDF profile samples and positive controls treated with DNase , to induce dsDNA breaks , showed a more intense band of about 48 kb , which fits the toroid model of DNA compaction in sperm , pointing out that some nuclease activity may be affecting their sperm DNA in RPL patients . This work identifies a very specific SDF profile related to the paternal risk of having RPL .
Perlecan Domain V ( DV ) promotes brain angiogenesis by inducing VEGF release from brain endothelial cells ( BECs ) following stroke . In this study , we define the specific mechanism of DV interaction with the alpha(5)beta(1) integrin , identify the downstream signal transduction pathway , and further investigate the functional significance of resultant VEGF release . Interestingly , we found that the LG3 portion of DV , which has been suggested to possess most of DV's angio-modulatory activity outside of the brain , binds poorly to alpha(5)beta(1) and induces less BEC proliferation compared to full length DV . Additionally , we implicate DV's DGR sequence as an important element for the interaction of DV with alpha(5)beta(1) . Furthermore , we investigated the importance of AKT and ERK signaling in DV-induced VEGF expression and secretion . We show that DV increases the phosphorylation of ERK , which leads to subsequent activation and stabilization of eIF4E and HIF-1alpha . Inhibition of ERK activity by U0126 suppressed DV-induced expression and secretion of VEGR in BECs . While DV was capable of phosphorylating AKT we show that AKT phosphorylation does not play a role in DV's induction of VEGF expression or secretion using two separate inhibitors , LY294002 and Akt IV . Lastly , we demonstrate that VEGF activity is critical for DV increases in BEC proliferation , as well as angiogenesis in a BEC-neuronal co-culture system . Collectively , our findings expand our understanding of DV's mechanism of action on BECs , and further support its potential as a novel stroke therapy .
The phosphorylated form of histone H2AX ( \u03b3-H2AX ) forms immunohistochemically detectable foci at DNA double strand breaks . In peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) derived from leukapheresis from patients enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging , \u03b3-H2AX foci increased in a linear fashion with regards to age , peaking at years . The relationship between the frequency of \u03b3-H2AX foci and age-related pathologies was assessed . We found a statistically significant ( p = 0.023 ) 50% increase in foci in PBMCs derived from patients with a known history of vitamin D deficiency . In addition , there were trends toward increased \u03b3-H2AX foci in patients with cataracts ( 34% increase , p<0.10 ) and in sleep apnea patients ( 44% , p<0.10 ) . Among patients \u226557 y/o , we found a significant ( p = 0.037 ) 36% increase in the number of \u03b3-H2AX foci/cell for patients with hypertension compared to non-hypertensive patients . Our results support a role for increased DNA damage in the morbidity of age-related diseases. \u03b3 -H2AX may be a biomarker for human morbidity in age-related diseases .
Forkhead box protein O1 ( FOXO1 ) , a key member of the FOXO family of transcription factors , acts as a tumor suppressor and has been associated with various key cellular functions , including cell growth , differentiation , apoptosis and angiogenesis . Therefore , it is puzzling why FOXO protein expression is downregulated in cancer cells . MicroRNAs , non-coding 20 nucleotide single-stranded RNAs , result in translational repression or degradation and gene silencing of their target genes , and significantly contribute to the regulation of gene expression . In the current study , we report that miR-370 expression was significantly upregulated in five prostate cancer cell lines , compared to normal prostatic epithelial ( PrEC ) cells . Ectopic expression of miR-370 induced proliferation and increased the anchorage-independent growth and colony formation ability of DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells , while inhibition of miR-370 reduced proliferation , anchorage-independent growth and colony formation ability . Furthermore , upregulation of miR-370 promoted the entry of DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells into the G1/S cell cycle transition , which was associated with downregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitors , p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip1) , and upregulation of the cell-cycle regulator cyclin D1 mRNA . Additionally , we demonstrated that miR-370 can downregulate expression of FOXO1 by directly targeting the FOXO1 3'-untranslated region . Taken together , our results suggest that miR-370 plays an important role in the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells , by directly suppressing the tumor suppressor FOXO1 .
The SR/CR mouse phenotype , first described in 1999 in BALB/c and later bred into C57BL/6 mice , is resistant to cancer formation following high doses of cancer cells administered intraperitoneally . The tumor cell targeting and destruction mechanisms have not been identified . By fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis , the immune response of SR/CR mice after intraperitoneal injection of cancer cells was investigated and compared with parent strain mice . A massive influx of leukocytes into the peritoneal cavity was found . A large fraction of these leukocytes were polymorphonuclear granulocytes , macrophages and natural killer cells . A relative decrease in influx of B-cells compared with controls was demonstrated . Increased proportions of leukocytes belonging to the innate immune system were also demonstrated in splenocytes of SR/CR mice . Cytospins of peritoneal fluid from SR/CR mice after cancer cell injection showed formations of immune cells morphologically resembling polymorphonuclear granulocytes and macrophages adjoining the cancer cells . The results point to the potential involvement of innate immune cells in cancer immunology . Our data support migration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes , macrophages and NK cells into the peritoneum of the SR/CR mouse in response to intraperitoneal injection of S180 cancer cells . The cell composition of spleens of SR/CR mice reflected the differential regulation of the innate immune cells in peritoneal exudates . Both peritoneal exudates and the spleens of SR/CR mice contained decreased proportions of B-cells compared with BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice . We reproduce important aspects of previous published data and further extend them by showing differentially regulated populations of splenocytes including B-lymphocytes in SR/CR mice compared with parent strain controls . Importantly , this differentially regulated immune response of SR/CR mice could not be found in response to challenge with the lymphoma cell line EL-4 .
High-altitude long-term hypoxia ( LTH ) is known to induce pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell ( PASMC ) proliferation in the fetus , leading to pulmonary arterial remodeling and pulmonary hypertension of the newborn . The mechanisms underlying these conditions remain enigmatic however . We hypothesized that epigenetic alterations in fetal PASMC induced by high-altitude LTH may play an important role in modulating their proliferation during pulmonary arterial remodeling . To test this hypothesis , we have analyzed epigenetic alterations in the pulmonary vasculature of fetal lambs exposed to high-altitude LTH [ pregnant ewes were kept at 3,801 m altitude from to 145 days gestation ] or to sea level atmosphere . Intrapulmonary arteries were isolated , and fetal PASMC were cultured from both control and LTH fetuses . Compared with controls , in LTH fetus pulmonary arteries measurements of histone acetylation and global DNA methylation demonstrated reduced levels of global histone 4 acetylation and DNA methylation , accompanied by the loss of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 . Treatment of LTH fetal PASMCs with histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor trichostatin A decreased their proliferation rate , in part because of altered expression of p21 at both RNA and protein level . In PASMC of LTH fetuses , HDAC inhibition also decreased PDGF-induced cell migration and ERK1/2 activation and modulated global DNA methylation . On the basis of these observations , we propose that epigenetic alterations ( reduced histone acetylation and DNA methylation ) caused by chronic hypoxia leads to fetal PASMC proliferation and vessel remodeling associated with vascular proliferative disease and that this process is regulated by p21 .
The orphan receptor TR3 is an important regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis . However , whether TR3 is involved in regulating the stem-like properties of cancer cells remains unknown . The present study shows that TR3 expression is increased in gastric tumorsphere cells and is positively correlated with cancer stem cell ( CSC ) characteristics . Knocking down TR3 leads to the suppression of its stem-like properties in both gastric cancer cells and tumorsphere cells . This process involves the decreased expression of the stemness-related genes Oct-4 and Nanog and the invasion-related gene MMP-9 . We further identify Nanog as a new target for the transcription factor TR3 . Together , these data demonstrate for the first time that TR3 is essential for the maintenance of stem-like properties in human gastric cancer cells and implicate TR3 as a new therapeutic target for gastric cancer .
The recent approval of a prostate cancer vaccine has renewed hope for anticancer immunotherapies . However , the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment may limit the effectiveness of current immunotherapies . Antiangiogenic agents have the potential to modulate the tumor microenvironment and improve immunotherapy , but they often are used at high doses in the clinic to prune tumor vessels and paradoxically may compromise various therapies . Here , we demonstrate that targeting tumor vasculature with lower vascular-normalizing doses , but not high antivascular/antiangiogenic doses , of an anti-VEGF receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) antibody results in a more homogeneous distribution of functional tumor vessels . Furthermore , lower doses are superior to the high doses in polarizing tumor-associated macrophages from an immune inhibitory M2-like phenotype toward an immune stimulatory M1-like phenotype and in facilitating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell tumor infiltration . Based on this mechanism , scheduling lower-dose anti-VEGFR2 therapy with T-cell activation induced by a whole cancer cell vaccine therapy enhanced anticancer efficacy in a CD8(+) T-cell-dependent manner in both immune-tolerant and immunogenic murine breast cancer models . These findings indicate that vascular-normalizing lower doses of anti-VEGFR2 antibody can reprogram the tumor microenvironment away from immunosuppression toward potentiation of cancer vaccine therapies . Given that the combinations of high doses of bevacizumab with chemotherapy have not improved overall survival of breast cancer patients , our study suggests a strategy to use antiangiogenic agents in breast cancer more effectively with active immunotherapy and potentially other anticancer therapies .
Neural stem cells ( NSCs ) are considered to be the cell of origin of glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . However , the genetic alterations that transform NSCs into glioma-initiating cells remain elusive . Using a unique transposon mutagenesis strategy that mutagenizes NSCs in culture , followed by additional rounds of mutagenesis to generate tumors in vivo , we have identified genes and signaling pathways that can transform NSCs into glioma-initiating cells . Mobilization of Sleeping Beauty transposons in NSCs induced the immortalization of astroglial-like cells , which were then able to generate tumors with characteristics of the mesenchymal subtype of GBM on transplantation , consistent with a potential astroglial origin for mesenchymal GBM . Sequence analysis of transposon insertion sites from tumors and immortalized cells identified more than 200 frequently mutated genes , including human GBM-associated genes , such as Met and Nf1 , and made it possible to discriminate between genes that function during astroglial immortalization vs. later stages of tumor development . We also functionally validated five GBM candidate genes using a previously undescribed high-throughput method . Finally , we show that even clonally related tumors derived from the same immortalized line have acquired distinct combinations of genetic alterations during tumor development , suggesting that tumor formation in this model system involves competition among genetically variant cells , which is similar to the Darwinian evolutionary processes now thought to generate many human cancers . This mutagenesis strategy is faster and simpler than conventional transposon screens and can potentially be applied to any tissue stem/progenitor cells that can be grown and differentiated in vitro .
Human podoplanin is a type-1 transmembrane sialomucin-like glycoprotein that is involved in cell migration , tumor cell invasion and metastasis . Our recent study of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) demonstrated that the degree of immunohistochemical expression of podoplanin was correlated with the severity of epithelial dysplasia and significantly associated with a poor pathologic grade of differentiation . Furthermore , it has been reported that Src directly associates with the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in OSCC cells upon stimulation with EGF and phosphorylates Crk-associated substrate ( Cas ) , podoplanin acting downstream of Src and Cas to promote cell migration . However , the molecular function of podoplanin remains unclear . In this study we performed real-time RT-PCR , Western blotting and scratch assay using OSCC cell lines in order to clarify the molecular biological function of podoplanin expression associated with various growth factors including EGF and with the Src-Cas signaling pathway . Podoplanin was found to have a marked influence on cancer cell migration and the expression of matrix metalloprotease-9 ( MMP-9 ) in the oral cavity upon stimulation with EGF . Podoplanin promotes oral cancer cell migration , and the EGF-Src-Cas pathway is one of the possible mechanisms responsible for progression of cancer in the oral cavity .
Here , we identified the milk protein alpha-casein as a novel suppressor of tumor growth and metastasis . Briefly , Met-1 mammary tumor cells expressing alpha-casein showed a reduction in tumor growth and a near 10-fold decrease in experimental metastasis . To identify the molecular mechanism(s) , we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling . Interestingly , our results show that alpha-casein upregulates gene transcripts associated with interferon/STAT1 signaling and downregulates genes associated with " stemness. " These findings were validated by immunoblot and FACS analysis , which showed the upregulation and hyperactivation of STAT1 and a decrease in the number of CD44(+) " cancer stem cells. " These gene signatures were also able to predict clinical outcome in human breast cancer patients . Thus , we conclude that a lactation-based therapeutic strategy using recombinant alpha-casein would provide a more natural and non-toxic approach to the development of novel anticancer therapies .
BACKGROUND : The immune system has been shown to play an important role in gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) . The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) in blood is an easily assessable parameter of systemic inflammatory response . The aim of this study was to determine whether the NLR is prognostic in GIST . METHODS : A total of 339 previously untreated patients with primary , localized GIST operated at our institution between 1995 and 2010 were identified from a prospectively collected sarcoma database . NLR was assessed preoperatively . Patients who received adjuvant imatinib treatment were excluded from the analysis ( n=64 ) . Cox regression models were calculated and correlation analyses were performed . RESULTS : On univariate analysis , NLR was associated with recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) ( P=0.003 , hazard ratio 3.3 , 95% confidence interval 1.5-7.4 ) . Patients with a low NLR had a 1- and 5-year RFS of 98 and 91% , compared with 89 and 76% in those with a high NLR . The median RFS was not reached . Positive correlations were found between NLR and mitotic rate ( Pearson correlation coefficient [ r]=0.15 , P=0.03 ) , and NLR and tumor size ( r=0.36 , P=0.0001 ) . RFS in patients with a GIST>5cm with low NLR was significantly longer compared to patients with high NLR ( P=0.002 ) . Flow cytometry analysis of freshly obtained GISTs revealed that neutrophils constituted a minimal percentage of intratumoral immune cells . CONCLUSIONS : NLR is a surrogate for high-risk tumor features . Elevated blood NLR appears to represent systemic inflammation in patients with high-risk GIST .
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a fundamental process governing morphogenesis in multicellular organisms and has recently been implicated in promoting carcinoma invasion and metastasis . Besides their therapeutic effects , accumulating evidences suggest that chemotherapeutic agents also induced EMT and enhanced the malignancy of treated cancer cells ; however , the mechanism(s) still remains unclear . Here , we investigated the role of beta-catenin signaling in doxorubicin ( Dox)-induced EMT in human gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 . We found that the transient treatment of Dox induced EMT and enhanced the in vitro migration ability of cancer cells . We also found that beta-catenin signaling was activated upon Dox treatment . Inhibition of beta-catenin by indomethacin ( Indo ) or siRNA suppressed Dox-induced EMT and decreased cancer cell migration ability . Our results showed that beta-catenin signaling was critical to Dox-induced EMT . Indo and other beta-catenin inhibitors may have a potential implication in prevention of gastric cancer metastasis .
Vasohibin-1 ( VASH1 ) is isolated as an endothelial cell ( EC)-produced angiogenesis inhibitor . We questioned whether VASH1 plays any role besides angiogenesis inhibition , knocked-down or overexpressed VASH1 in ECs , and examined the changes of EC property . Knock-down of VASH1 induced premature senescence of ECs , and those ECs were easily killed by cellular stresses . In contrast , overexpression of VASH1 made ECs resistant to premature senescence and cell death caused by cellular stresses . The synthesis of VASH1 was regulated by HuR-mediated post-transcriptional regulation . We sought to define the underlying mechanism . VASH1 increased the expression of ( superoxide dismutase 2 ) SOD2 , an enzyme known to quench reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . Simultaneously , VASH1 augmented the synthesis of sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1 ) , an anti-aging protein , which improved stress tolerance . Paraquat generates ROS and causes organ damage when administered in vivo . More VASH1 ( +/- ) mice died due to acute lung injury caused by paraquat . Intratracheal administration of an adenovirus vector encoding human VASH1 augmented SOD2 and SIRT1 expression in the lungs and prevented acute lung injury caused by paraquat . Thus , VASH1 is a critical factor that improves the stress tolerance of ECs via the induction of SOD2 and SIRT1 .
Widespread changes in gene expression drive tumorigenesis , yet our knowledge of how aberrant epigenomic and transcriptome profiles arise in cancer cells is poorly understood . Here , we demonstrate that metabolic transformation plays an important role . Butyrate is the primary energy source of normal colonocytes and is metabolized to acetyl-CoA , which was shown to be important not only for energetics but also for HAT activity . Due to the Warburg effect , cancerous colonocytes rely on glucose as their primary energy source , so butyrate accumulated and functioned as an HDAC inhibitor . Although both mechanisms increased histone acetylation , different target genes were upregulated . Consequently , butyrate stimulated the proliferation of normal colonocytes and cancerous colonocytes when the Warburg effect was prevented from occurring , whereas it inhibited the proliferation of cancerous colonocytes undergoing the Warburg effect . These findings link a common metabolite to epigenetic mechanisms that are differentially utilized by normal and cancerous cells because of their inherent metabolic differences .
TNF , an inflammatory cytokine that is enriched in the tumor microenvironment , promotes tumor growth and subverts innate immune responses to cancer cells . We previously reported that tumors implanted in TNF receptor-deficient ( Tnfr-/- ) mice are spontaneously rejected ; however , the molecular mechanisms underlying this rejection are unclear . Here we report that TNF signaling drives the peripheral accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) . MDSCs expand extensively during inflammation and tumor progression in mice and humans and can enhance tumor growth by repressing T cell-mediated antitumor responses . Peripheral accumulation of MDSCs was drastically impaired in Tnfr-/- mice . Signaling of TNFR-2 , but not TNFR-1 , promoted MDSC survival through upregulation of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein ( c-FLIP ) and inhibition of caspase-8 activity . Loss of TNFRs impaired the induction of MDSCs from bone marrow cells , but this could be reversed by treatment with caspase inhibitors . These results demonstrate that TNFR-2 signaling promotes MDSC survival and accumulation and helps tumor cells evade the immune system .
Although prostate cancer ( CaP ) is the most frequently diagnosed malignant tumor in American men , the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of CaP remain largely unknown . Recent studies have shown that downregulation of the microRNA miR-124 occurs in several types of human cancer , suggesting a tumor suppressive function of miR-124 . Until now , however , it has been unclear whether miR-124 is associated with CaP . In the present study , we completed a series of experiments to understand the functional role of miR-124 in CaP . We detected the expression level of miR-124 in clinical CaP tissues , evaluated the influence of miR-124 on the growth of CaP cells and investigated the mechanism underlying the dysregulation of miR-124 . We found that ( i ) miR-124 directly targets the androgen receptor ( AR ) and subsequently induces an upregulation of p53 ; ( ii ) miR-124 is significantly downregulated in malignant prostatic cells compared to benign cells , and DNA methylation causes the reduced expression of miR-124 ; and ( iii ) miR-124 can inhibit the growth of CaP cells in vitro and in vivo . Data from this study revealed that loss of miR-124 expression is a common event in CaP , which may contribute to the pathogenesis of CaP . Our studies also suggest that miR-124 is a potential tumor suppressive gene in CaP , and restoration of miR-124 expression may represent a novel strategy for CaP therapy.Oncogene advance online publication , 15 October 2012 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.425 .
There is a complex interplay between the immune system and a developing tumor that is manifest in the way that the balance of Tcell subsets in the local tumor environment reflects clinical outcome . Tumor infiltration by CD8(+) Tcells and regulatory Tcells ( Treg ) is associated with improved and reduced survival , respectively , in many cancer types . However , little is known of the prognostic value of immunological parameters measured in peripheral blood . In this study , peripheral CD8(+) T cells and Treg from 43 patients with malignant mesothelioma or advanced non-small-cell lung cancer scheduled to commence palliative chemotherapy were assessed by flow cytometry and evaluated for association with patient survival . Patients had a higher proportion of peripheral Treg , proliferating CD8(+) Tcells and CD8(+) Tcells with an activated effector phenotype compared with age-matched healthy controls . Higher proportions of Treg and proliferating CD8(+) Tcells were both associated with poor survival in univariate analyses ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 3.81 , 95% CI 1.69-8.57 ; p<0.01 and HR 2.86 , 95% CI 1.26-6.50 ; p<0.05 , respectively ) . CD8(+) Tcell proliferation was independently predictive of reduced survival in multivariate analysis ( HR 2.58 , 95% CI 1.01-6.61 ; p<0.05 ) . These findings suggest that peripheral CD8(+) T cell proliferation can be a useful prognostic marker in patients with thoracic malignancies planned for palliative chemotherapy .
5-methylcytosine ( 5-mC ) constitutes of the total cytosines in human genomic DNA and impacts a broad range of biological functions , including gene expression , maintenance of genome integrity , parental imprinting , X-chromosome inactivation , regulation of development , aging , and cancer(1) . Recently , the presence of an oxidized 5-mC , 5-hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5-hmC ) , was discovered in mammalian cells , in particular in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells and neuronal cells(2-4). 5-hmC is generated by oxidation of 5-mC catalyzed by TET family iron ( II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases(2 , 3). 5-hmC is proposed to be involved in the maintenance of embryonic stem ( mES ) cell , normal hematopoiesis and malignancies , and zygote development(2 , 5-10 ) . To better understand the function of 5-hmC , a reliable and straightforward sequencing system is essential . Traditional bisulfite sequencing cannot distinguish 5-hmC from 5-mC(11) . To unravel the biology of 5-hmC , we have developed a highly efficient and selective chemical approach to label and capture 5-hmC , taking advantage of a bacteriophage enzyme that adds a glucose moiety to 5-hmC specifically(12) . Here we describe a straightforward two-step procedure for selective chemical labeling of 5-hmC . In the first labeling step , 5-hmC in genomic DNA is labeled with a 6-azide-glucose catalyzed by beta-GT , a glucosyltransferase from T4 bacteriophage , in a way that transfers the 6-azide-glucose to 5-hmC from the modified cofactor , UDP-6-N3-Glc ( 6-N3UDPG ) . In the second step , biotinylation , a disulfide biotin linker is attached to the azide group by click chemistry . Both steps are highly specific and efficient , leading to complete labeling regardless of the abundance of 5-hmC in genomic regions and giving extremely low background . Following biotinylation of 5-hmC , the 5-hmC-containing DNA fragments are then selectively captured using streptavidin beads in a density-independent manner . The resulting 5-hmC-enriched DNA fragments could be used for downstream analyses , including next-generation sequencing . Our selective labeling and capture protocol confers high sensitivity , applicable to any source of genomic DNA with variable/diverse 5-hmC abundances . Although the main purpose of this protocol is its downstream application ( i.e. , next-generation sequencing to map out the 5-hmC distribution in genome ) , it is compatible with single-molecule , real-time SMRT ( DNA ) sequencing , which is capable of delivering single-base resolution sequencing of 5-hmC .
Here , we set out to test the novel hypothesis that increased mitochondrial biogenesis in epithelial cancer cells would " fuel " enhanced tumor growth . For this purpose , we generated MDA-MB-231 cells ( a triple-negative human breast cancer cell line ) overexpressing PGC-1alpha and MitoNEET , which are established molecules that drive mitochondrial biogenesis and increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) . Interestingly , both PGC-1alpha and MitoNEET increased the abundance of OXPHOS protein complexes , conferred autophagy resistance under conditions of starvation and increased tumor growth by up to However , this increase in tumor growth was independent of neo-angiogenesis , as assessed by immunostaining and quantitation of vessel density using CD31 antibodies . Quantitatively similar increases in tumor growth were also observed by overexpression of PGC-1beta and POLRMT in MDA-MB-231 cells , which are also responsible for mediating increased mitochondrial biogenesis . Thus , we propose that increased mitochondrial " power " in epithelial cancer cells oncogenically promotes tumor growth by conferring autophagy resistance . As such , PGC-1alpha , PGC-1beta , mitoNEET and POLRMT should all be considered as tumor promoters or " metabolic oncogenes. " Our results are consistent with numerous previous clinical studies showing that metformin ( a weak mitochondrial " poison" ) prevents the onset of nearly all types of human cancers in diabetic patients . Therefore , metformin ( a complex I inhibitor ) and other mitochondrial inhibitors should be developed as novel anticancer therapies , targeting mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells .
Liver metastasis from colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality . Myeloid cells play pivotal roles in the metastatic process , but their prometastatic functions in liver metastasis remain incompletely understood . To investigate their role , we simulated liver metastasis in C57BL/6 mice through intrasplenic inoculation of MC38 colon carcinoma cells . Among the heterogeneous myeloid infiltrate , we identified a distinct population of CD11b/Gr1(mid) cells different from other myeloid populations previously associated with liver metastasis . These cells increased in number dramatically during establishment of liver metastases and were recruited from bone marrow by tumor-derived CCL2 . Liver metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma cells followed this pattern but this mechanism is not universal as liver colonization by B16F1 melanoma cells did not recruit similar subsets . Inhibition of CCL2 signaling and absence of its cognate receptor CCR2 reduced CD11b/Gr1(mid) recruitment and decreased tumor burden . Depletion of the CD11b/Gr1(mid) subset in a transgenic CD11b-diphtheria toxin receptor mouse model markedly reduced tumor cell proliferation . There was no evidence for involvement of an adaptive immune response in the prometastatic effects of CD11b/Gr1(mid) cells . Additionally , an analogous myeloid subset was found in liver metastases of some colorectal cancer patients . Conclusion : Collectively , our findings highlight the importance of myeloid cells-in this case a selective CD11b/Gr1(mid) subset-in sustaining development of colorectal cancer liver metastasis and identify a potential target for antimetastatic therapy .

A metaphase chromosome analysis method was used to evaluate the mutagenic activity of volatile petroleum fractions in chronically intoxicated rats . The findings indicate that chronic inhalation exposure of the rats to volatile petroleum fractions at different concentrations results in a significant ( 2.5-fold ) increase , compared to the spontaneous level , in the occurrence of chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow cells in a number of generations . In addition to chromosomal structural abnormalities , there are genomic changes ( aneuploidy , polyploidy ) . There is a tendency towards an increased rate of petroleum-induced chromosomal aberrations in a number of generations ( P , F1 , and F2 ) in the rat bone marrow cells . The maximum mutagenic effect of volatile petroleum fractions was found when used at concentrations of 10 and 100 mg/l upon long-term chronic exposure during three generations ( P1 , F1 , and F2 ) . The findings are indicative of the mutagenic activity of volatile petroleum fractions , which is likely to pose a potential risk from environmental pollution to biota and population health in the area of intensive oil extraction and refining .
BACKGROUND Patients with invasive breast ductal carcinoma ( IBDC ) with metastasis have a very poor prognosis . Little is known about the synergistic action of growth and inflammatory factors in IBDC metastases . METHODS The expression of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 ( phosphorylated or p-ERK1/2 ) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in IBDC tissue samples from 80 cases . BT474 IBDC cell migration and invasion were quantified using the Transwell assay . Matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-9 expression and activity were analyzed by RT-PCR , Western blotting and zymography . Activator protein ( AP)-1 activity was measured with a luciferase reporter gene assay . The Wilcoxon signed-rank test , Chi-square test , the partition of Chi-square test , independent t-test , and Spearman's method were used for the statistical analysis . RESULTS Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected in 58/80 ( 72.5% ) IBDC tissues , and was associated with higher TNM stage and lymph node metastasis , but not patient age or tumor size . Individually , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , and interleukin ( IL)-1beta activated ERK1/2 , increased cell migration and invasion , MMP-9 expression and activity , AP-1 activation in vitro and the expression of p-ERK1/2 was positively correlated with EGF expression levels , as well as IL-1beta , MMP-9 and c-fos in IBDC tissue samples . Co-stimulation with EGF and IL-1beta synergistically increased ERK1/2 and AP-1 activation , cell migration and invasion , and MMP-9 expression and activity . Inhibition of ERK1/2 using U0126 or siRNA abolished EGF and/or IL-1beta-induced cell migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner . CONCLUSION Activated ERK1/2 was associated with higher TNM stage and lymph node metastasis in IBDC . Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that ERK-1/2 activation may increase the metastatic ability of IBDC cells . Growth and inflammatory factors synergistically induced IBDC cell migration and invasion via ERK1/2 signaling , AP-1 activation and MMP-9 upregulation .
PURPOSE Recently , a new renal cell cancer syndrome has been linked to germline mutation of multiple subunits ( SDHB/C/D ) of the Krebs cycle enzyme , succinate dehydrogenase . We report our experience with the diagnosis , evaluation and treatment of this novel form of hereditary kidney cancer . MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with suspected hereditary kidney cancer were enrolled on a National Cancer Institute institutional review board approved protocol to study inherited forms of kidney cancer . Individuals from families with germline SDHB , SDHC and SDHD mutations , and kidney cancer underwent comprehensive clinical and genetic evaluation . RESULTS A total of 14 patients from 12 SDHB mutation families were evaluated . Patients presented with renal cell cancer at an early age ( 33 years , range 15 to 62 ) , metastatic kidney cancer developed in 4 and some families had no manifestation other than kidney tumors . An additional family with 6 individuals found to have clear cell renal cell cancer that presented at a young average age ( 47 years , range 40 to 53 ) was identified with a germline SDHC mutation ( R133X ) Metastatic disease developed in 2 of these family members . A patient with a history of carotid body paragangliomas and an aggressive form of kidney cancer was evaluated from a family with a germline SDHD mutation . CONCLUSIONS SDH mutation associated renal cell carcinoma can be an aggressive type of kidney cancer , especially in younger individuals . Although detection and management of early tumors is most often associated with a good outcome , based on our initial experience with these patients and our long-term experience with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma , we recommend careful surveillance of patients at risk for SDH mutation associated renal cell carcinoma and wide surgical excision of renal tumors .
Alteration of the oxidative stress of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells can influence the expressions of genes favored angiogenesis . Quinone reductase 2 which can activate quinones leading to reactive oxygen species production is a melatonin receptor known as MT3 . Prazosin prescribed for benign prostate hyperplasia and hypertension is a potent antagonist for MT3 . This study was to investigate the influence of therapeutic concentrations of prazosin ( 0.01 and 0.1muM ) on cell proliferation and differential expressions of CCL2 , CCL20 , CXCL6 , CXCL10 , IL8 and IL6 genes related to inflammation and/or oxidative stress in human HCC cell lines . Two HCC cell lines including one without susceptible to amphotericin B-induced oxidative stress ( cell line A ; HCC24/KMUH ) and one with this effect ( cell line B ; HCC38/KMUH ) were investigated by 0.01 and 0.1muM prazosin . The premixed WST-1 cell proliferation reagent was applied for proliferation assay . Differential expressions of genes were examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction . Our results showed that both 0.01 and 0.1muM prazosin did not influence cell proliferation in both cell lines . Both 0.01 and 0.1muM prazosin in cell line A and 0.01muM prazosin in cell line B did not cause differential expressions of tested genes . However , 0.1muM prazosin caused remarkable up-regulation of IL6 gene and slightly up-regulation of CCL2 gene in cell line B. In conclusion , high therapeutic concentration of prazosin can up-regulate angiogenic IL6 and CCL2 genes in human HCC cells susceptible to amphotericin B-induced oxidative stress . Clinical application of prazosin in patients with HCC should consider this possibility .
Centrosome overduplication or amplification has been observed in many human cancers and in premalignant tissue , but the mechanisms leading to such centrosome aberrations are not fully understood . We previously showed that abnormal mitotic cells with supernumerary centrosomes increase with replicative senescence in human fibroblasts , especially in a polyploid subpopulation . This study examines localization of p53 protein at centrosomes in mitotic cells , which is often observed in association with DNA damage response , to investigate a possible association between p53 localization and numerical centrosome aberrations induced by cellular senescence . Cultures at later passages or the 4th day after exposure to H(2)O(2) showed increased frequencies of mitotic cells with supernumerary centrosomes , especially in a polyploid subpopulation . Immunohistochemical analysis frequently showed p53-positive foci in mitotic cells , and some were localized at centrosomes . The number of p53-positive foci in mitotic cells and its localization to centrosomes increased with replicative and premature senescence . Supernumerary centrosomes showed higher frequencies of p53 localization compared to normally duplicated centrosomes . Centrosome-associated p53 protein was phosphorylated at Ser15 . These data suggest a possible association between localization of p53 protein and numerical centrosome aberrations in replicatively or prematurely senescent cells .
Purpose . The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a new PET tracer ( 64)Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDyK ) for imaging of tumor angiogenesis using gene expression of angiogenesis markers as reference and to estimate radiation dosimetry for humans . Procedures . Nude mice with human neuroendocrine tumor xenografts ( H727 ) were administered ( 64)Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDyK ) i.v. for study of biodistribution as well as for dynamic PET . Gene expression of angiogenesis markers integrin alpha(V) , integrin beta(3) , and VEGF-A were analyzed using QPCR and correlated to the tracer uptake in the tumors ( %ID/g ) . From biodistribution data human radiation-absorbed doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM . Results . Tumor uptake was 1.2%ID/g with strong correlations between gene expression and tracer uptake , for integrin alpha(V) R = 0.76 , integrin beta(3) R = 0.75 and VEGF-A R = 0.81 ( all P < 0.05 ) . The whole body effective dose for humans was estimated to be 0.038 and 0.029 mSv/MBq for females and males , respectively , with highest absorbed dose in bladder wall . Conclusion . ( 64)Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDyK ) is a promising new angiogenesis PET tracer with potential for human use .
Cytokine-dependent cell lines have been used to analyze the cytokine-induced cellular signaling and the mechanism of oncogenesis . In the current study , we analyzed MOTN-1 and PLT-2 cell lines established from different stages of a T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia patient ( Daibata et al. 2004 ) . MOTN-1 is IL-2-dependent derived from the chronic phase , whereas IL-2-independent PLT-2 is from the aggressive and terminal stage . They shared considerable chromosome abnormalities and the pattern of T-cell receptor rearrangement , presuming that the cytokine independence of PLT-2 was due to the additive genetic abnormality . Besides IL-2 , IL-15 supported MOTN-1 cell growth , because these receptors share beta- and gamma-subunits . IL-2 activated ERK , AKT and STAT pathway of MOTN-1 . STAT3 pathway of PLT-2 was also activated by IL-2 , suggesting intact IL-2 induces signal transduction of PLT-2 . However , ERK1/2 but not AKT , was continuously activated in PLT-2 , consistent with the increased Ras-activity of PLT-2 . Sequence analysis revealed KRAS G12A mutation but not NRAS and HRAS mutation of PLT-2 but not MOTN-1 . Another signaling molecule affecting Ras-signaling pathway , SHP2 , which has been frequently mutated in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) , did not show mutation . Moreover , MEK inhibitor , PD98059 , as well as farnesylation inhibitor inhibited PLT-2 cell growth . Using NIH3T3 and MOTN-1 , ERK activation , increased cell proliferation and survival by KRAS G12A were shown , suggesting the important role of KRAS G12A in IL-2-independent growth of PLT-2 . Taken together , KRAS G12A is important for IL-2-independent growth of PLT-2 cells and suggests the possibility of involvement of KRAS mutation with disease progression .
Angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( AT1R ) promotes tumor invasion , migration , metastasis and angiogenesis . We explored the potential antitumor effects of AT1R antagonists in breast cancer . We found that angiotensin II promoted cell proliferation and upregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) in MCF-7 cells . Losartan downregulated the expression of VEGF-A in MCF-7 cells treated with angiotensin II . Candesartan downregulated the expression of VEGF-A in mice bearing MCF-7 xenografts and inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis . AT1R and VEGF-A expression correlated with increased microvascular density in 102 breast cancer patients . Our data suggest that AT1R antagonists might be useful to suppress breast cancer by inhibiting the angiotensin II .
BACKGROUND Acrylamide is a common dietary exposure that crosses the human placenta . It is classified as a probable human carcinogen , and developmental toxicity has been observed in rodents . OBJECTIVES We examined the associations between prenatal exposure to acrylamide and birth outcomes in a prospective European mother-child study . METHODS Hemoglobin ( Hb ) adducts of acrylamide and its metabolite glycidamide were measured in cord blood ( reflecting cumulated exposure in the last months of pregnancy ) from 1,101 singleton pregnant women recruited in Denmark , England , Greece , Norway , and Spain during 2006-2010 . Maternal diet was estimated through food-frequency questionnaires . RESULTS Both acrylamide and glycidamide Hb adducts were associated with a statistically significant reduction in birth weight and head circumference . The estimated difference in birth weight for infants in the highest versus lowest quartile of acrylamide Hb adduct levels after adjusting for gestational age and country was -132 g ( 95% CI : -207 , -56 ) ; the corresponding difference for head circumference was -0.33 cm ( 95% CI : -0.61 , -0.06 ) . Findings were similar in infants of nonsmokers , were consistent across countries , and remained after adjustment for factors associated with reduced birth weight . Maternal consumption of foods rich in acrylamide , such as fried potatoes , was associated with cord blood acrylamide adduct levels and with reduced birth weight . CONCLUSIONS Dietary exposure to acrylamide was associated with reduced birth weight and head circumference . Consumption of specific foods during pregnancy was associated with higher acrylamide exposure in utero . If confirmed , these findings suggest that dietary intake of acrylamide should be reduced among pregnant women .
Toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) is a target for immune system stimulation during cancer immunotherapy and a cell-surface marker for pancreatic cancer . To develop targeted agents for cancer imaging and therapy , we designed , synthesized , and characterized 13 novel , fully synthetic high affinity TLR2 agonists . Analogue 10 had the highest agonist activity ( NF-kappaB functional assay , EC(50) = 20 nM ) and binding affinity ( competitive binding assay , K(i) = 25 nM ) . As an immune adjuvant , compound 10 stimulated the immune system in vivo by generation and persistence of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells indicating its potential use in cancer immunotherapy . After conjugation of near-infrared dye to 10 , agonist activity ( EC(50) = 34 nM ) and binding affinity ( K(i) = 11 nM ) were retained in 13 . Fluorescence signal was present in TLR2 expressing pancreatic tumor xenografts 24 h after injection of 13 , while an excess of unlabeled ligand blocked 13 from binding to the tumor , resulting in significantly decreased signal ( p < 0.001 ) demonstrating in vivo selectivity .
The CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell ( Treg ) is a special kind of T cell subset . Studies have showed that Treg cells are involved in a number of physiological processes and pathologic conditions such as autoimmune diseases , transplantation tolerance and cancer . Tregs with unique capacity for immune inhibition can impair anti-tumour immunity and help tumor cells to escape from immune surveillance . The aim of our study was to investigate whether Tregs are involved in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . A BABL/C mouse with HCC in situ model was established to evaluate the Treg existence in carcinoma tissues and the changes of Tregs in spleen using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry methods . Granzyme B expression in carcinoma tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry to investigate the tumor local immune status . The proportion of CD4+CD25+/CD4+ spleen lymphocytes of tumor bearing mice ( 18.8% <FFFD> 1.26% ) was found to be significantly higher than that in normal mice ( 9.99% <FFFD> 1.90% ) ( P<0.01 ) . Immunohistochemistry of spleen tissue also confirmed that there was an increase in Treg in tumor-bearing mice , while in carcinomas it showed Treg cells to be present in tumor infiltrating lymphocyte areas while Granzyme B was rarely observed . Anti-tumour immunity was suppressed , and this might be associated with the increase of Tregs . Our observations suggest that the CD4+CD25+Treg/ CD4+ proportion in spleen lymphocytes can be a sensitive index to evaluate the change of Tregs in hepatocellular carcinoma mice and the Treg may be a promising therapeutic target for cancer .
Clinically approved chemotherapeutic nanoparticles may provide advantages over free drugs by achieving slower clearance and preferential accumulation in tumors . However , the lack of leaky vasculatures can create barriers to the permeation of nm-sized nanoparticles in solid tumors . We hypothesized that nanoparticles designed to target both tumor and tumor stroma would penetrate deeper into the tumors . To construct such comprehensive drug carriers , we utilized cross-linked amphiphilic polymer nanoparticles and functionalized them to target ICAM-1 , a biomarker prevalent in various tumors and inflamed tumor stroma . The targeting moiety was derived from the modular domain present in alpha(L) integrin , which was engineered for high affinity and cross-reactivity with human and murine ICAM-1 . ICAM-1-selective delivery of paclitaxel produced potent tumor suppression of not only ICAM-1-positive cervical cancer cells but also ICAM-1-negative tumors , presumably by causing cytotoxicity in tumor-associated endothelium ( CD31(+) ) and macrophages ( CD68(+) ) over-expressing ICAM-1 . Contrary to the strategies of targeting only the tumor or specific tumor stromal constituents , we present a strategy in delivering therapeutics to the major cellular components of solid tumors . Drug carriers against inflammation-biomarkers may be effective against many different types of tumors , while being less susceptible to the highly mutable nature of tumor markers .
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the risk factors for sentinel lymph node metastasis and validate the value of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram for the prediction of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients . METHODS A sentinel lymph node biopsy database containing 1227 consecutive breast cancer patients ( 416 patients with at least one positive sentinel lymph node ) was retrospectively analyzed . The predictive value of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram was calculated by the trend line and the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve . Meanwhile , predictors for sentinel lymph node metastasis were also evaluated . RESULTS Tumor size , histological grade , lymphovascular invasion , mulifocality , estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status were significant independent predictors for sentinel lymph node metastasis ( all P<0.01 ) . The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram presented an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve value of 0.730 . Patients with predictive value<16% had a frequency of sentinel lymph node metastasis of 0.9% . Those with values larger than 70% had a frequency of 96.2% . CONCLUSIONS The risk factors for sentinel lymph node metastasis in our study were consistent with those in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram . The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram is a useful tool that could accurately predict the probability of sentinel lymph node metastasis in our breast cancer patients . Axillary surgical staging might be avoided in patients with a predictive value of <16% and axillary lymph node dissection might be done directly in those with a predictive value >70% , while other patients should still accept sentinel lymph node biopsy .
The topoisomerase II ( topo II ) DNA incision-and-ligation cycle can be poisoned ( for example following treatment with cancer chemotherapeutics ) to generate cytotoxic DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) with topo II covalently conjugated to DNA . Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 ( Tdp2 ) protects genomic integrity by reversing 5'-phosphotyrosyl-linked topo II-DNA adducts . Here , X-ray structures of mouse Tdp2-DNA complexes reveal that Tdp2 \u03b2-2-helix-\u03b2 DNA damage-binding ' grasp ' , helical ' cap ' and DNA lesion-binding elements fuse to form an elongated protein-DNA conjugate substrate-interaction groove . The Tdp2 DNA-binding surface is highly tailored for engagement of 5'-adducted single-stranded DNA ends and restricts nonspecific endonucleolytic or exonucleolytic processing . Structural , mutational and functional analyses support a single-metal ion catalytic mechanism for the exonuclease-endonuclease-phosphatase ( EEP ) nuclease superfamily and establish a molecular framework for targeted small-molecule blockade of Tdp2-mediated resistance to anticancer topoisomerase drugs .
The relevance of many BRCA2 variants of uncertain significance ( VUS ) to breast cancer has not been determined due to limited genetic information from families carrying these alterations . Here , we classified six new variants as pathogenic or nonpathogenic by analysis of genetic information from families carrying 64 individual BRCA2 DNA binding domain ( DBD ) missense mutations using a multifactorial likelihood model of cancer causality . Next , we evaluated the use of a homology-directed DNA break repair ( HDR ) functional assay as a method for inferring the clinical relevance of VUS in the DBD of BRCA2 using 18 established nonpathogenic missense variants and all 13 established pathogenic missense mutations from the BRCA2 DBD . Compared with the known status of these variants based on the multifactorial likelihood model , the sensitivity of the HDR assay for pathogenic mutations was estimated at 100% [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 75.3%-100% ] and specificity was estimated at 100% ( 95% CI : 81.5%-100% ) . A statistical classifier for predicting the probability of pathogenicity of BRCA2 DBD variants was developed using these functional results . When applied to 33 additional VUS , the classifier identified eight with 99% or more probability of nonpathogenicity and 18 with 99% or more probability of pathogenicity . Thus , in the absence of genetic evidence , a cell-based HDR assay can provide a probability of pathogenicity for all VUS in the BRCA2 DBD , suggesting that the assay can be used in combination with other information to determine the cancer relevance of BRCA2 VUS .
Dose-dense ( DD ) regimens of combination chemotherapy may produce superior clinical outcomes , but the basis for these effects are not completely clear . In this study , we assessed whether a DD combinatorial regimen of low-dose cisplatin and paclitaxel produces superior immune-mediated efficacy when compared with a maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) regimen in treating platinum-resistant ovarian cancer as modeled in mice . Immune responses generated by the DD regimen were identified with regard to the immune cell subset responsible for the antitumor effects observed . The DD regimen was less toxic to the immune system , reduced immunosuppression by the tumor microenvironment , and triggered recruitment of macrophages and tumor-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses to tumors [ as determined by interleukin ( IL)-2 and IFN-gamma secretion ] . In this model , we found that the DD regimen exerted greater therapeutic effects than the MTD regimen , justifying its further clinical investigation . Fourteen patients with platinum-resistant relapse of ovarian cancer received DD chemotherapy consisting of weekly carboplatin ( AUC2 ) and paclitaxel ( 60-80 mg/m(2) ) as the third- or fourth-line treatment . Serum was collected over the course of treatment , and serial IFN-gamma and IL-2 levels were used to determine CD8(+) T-cell activation . Of the four patients with disease control , three had serum levels of IL-2 and IFN-gamma associated with cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cell activity . The therapeutic effect of the DD chemotherapy relied on the preservation of the immune system and the treatment-mediated promotion of tumor-specific immunity , especially the antitumor CD8(+) T-cell response . Because the DD regimen controlled drug-resistant disease through a novel immune mechanism , it may offer a fine strategy for salvage treatment . Cancer Res ; 73(1) ; 119-27. <FFFD>2012 AACR .
Blockage of the metastasis process remains a significant clinical challenge , requiring innovative therapeutic approaches . For this purpose , molecules that inhibit matrix metalloproteinases activity or induce the expression of their natural inhibitor , the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) , are potentially interesting . In a previous study , we have shown that synthetic ligands binding to cell surface nucleolin/nucleophosmin and known as HB 19 for the lead compound and NucAnt 6L ( N6L ) for the most potent analog , inhibit both tumor growth and angiogenesis . Furthermore , they prevent metastasis in a RET transgenic mice model which develops melanoma . Here , we investigated the effect of N6L on the invasion capacity of MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells . Our results show that the multivalent pseudopeptide N6L inhibited Matrigel invasion of MDA-MB-435 cells in a modified Boyden chamber model . This was associated with an increase in TIMP-3 in the cell culture medium without a change in TIMP-3 mRNA expression suggesting its release from cell surface and/or extracellular matrix . This may be explained by our demonstrated N6L interaction with sulfated glycosaminoglycans and consequently the controlled bioavailability of glycosaminoglycan-bound TIMP-3 . The implication of TIMP-3 in N6L-induced inhibition of cell invasion was evidenced by siRNA silencing experiments showing that the loss of TIMP-3 expression abrogated the effect of N6L . The inhibition of tumor cell invasion by N6L demonstrated in this study , in addition to its previously established inhibitory effect on tumor growth and angiogenesis , suggests that N6L represents a promising anticancer drug candidate warranting further investigation .
Melittin ( 1 ) is a major polypeptide in honey bee venom that has been used traditionally against chronic inflammation and cancer . However , its molecular mechanism has not been determined . In this study , the antitumor effect of 1 was compared with that of NS398 , a cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitor , in vivo and in vitro . Subcutaneous injection of 1 at 0.5 and 5 mg/kg suppressed significantly vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A-transfected highly metastatic Lewis lung cancer ( VEGF-A-hm LLC ) tumor growth by 25% and 57% , respectively . Also , 1 inhibited significantly the number of vessels around VEGF-A-hm LLC cells . The results were superior to those obtained in the mice treated with NS398 . Compound 1 dose-dependently inhibited proliferation and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( VEGF-A-HUVECs ) , without affecting cell viability in native HUVECs . In addition , 1 decreased the expression of VEGF receptor-2 ( VEGFR-2 ) , COX-2 , and prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) in VEGF-A-transfected HUVECs . These effects were accompanied by a reduction of the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and c-jun N-terminal kinase , whereas it increased the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) . SB203580 abolished the downregulation of COX-2 and VEGFR-2 and the inhibition of cell proliferation by 1 . The antitumor activity of 1 may be associated with antiangiogenic actions via inhibiting VEGFR-2 and inflammatory mediators involved in the MAPK signaling pathway .
INTRODUCTION Characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of colonic adenomas , classic familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is one of the most common hereditary syndromes associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer . Several studies have attempted to correlate specific APC mutations with clinical phenotype.6 However , there is considerable variability in the expression of specific phenotypes within families and among individuals with identical mutations.7 CASE PRESENTATION A 30 year-old Hispanic female presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of persistent , worsening , left lower quadrant abdominal pain . She had no family history of malignancy . Sigmoidoscopy revealed innumerable polyps in the rectum and sigmoid colon and a large mass in the sigmoid colon . Biopsy of the mass revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading the subserosa . Endoscopy revealed innumerable polyps . Genetic testing of the patient via southern blot revealed a germline APC mutation 3927del5 , resulting in a premature truncation of the APC protein at amino acid position 1312 . CONCLUSION Genetic information has only recently started being incorporated into clinical care . More research and randomized clinical trials need to be conducted to definitively characterize random mutations . Once these mutations are further understood , FAP patients may be able to be risk stratified and this may ultimately improve the screening , diagnosis , and treatment of this rare condition .
BACKGROUND Investigations concerned the mechanism of HT-29 cells radiosensitization by cis-9,trans-11-conjugated linoleic acid ( c9,t11-CLA ) , a natural component of human diet with proven antitumor activity . METHODS The cells were incubated for 24h with 70\u03bcM c9,t11-CLA and then X-irradiated . The following methods were used : gas chromatography ( incorporation of the CLA isomer ) , flow cytometry ( cell cycle ) , cloning ( survival ) , Western blotting ( protein distribution in membrane fractions ) , and pulse-field gel electrophoresis ( rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks ) . In parallel , DNA-PK activity , \u03b3-H2AX foci numbers and chromatid fragmentation were estimated . Gene expression was analysed by RT-PCR and chromosomal aberrations by the mFISH method . Nuclear accumulation of the EGF receptor ( EGFR ) was monitored by ELISA . RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS C9,t11-CLA sensitized HT-29 cells to X-radiation . This effect was not due to changes in cell cycle progression or DNA-repair-related gene expression . Post-irradiation DSB rejoining was delayed , corresponding with the insufficient DNA-PK activation , although chromosomal aberration frequencies did not increase . Distributions of cholesterol and caveolin-1 in cellular membrane fractions changed . The nuclear EGFR translocation , necessary to increase the DNA-PK activity in response to oxidative stress , was blocked . We suppose that c9,t11-CLA modified the membrane structure , thus disturbing the intracellular EGFR transport and the EGFR-dependent pro-survival signalling , both functionally associated with lipid raft properties . GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE The results point to the importance of the cell membrane interactions with the nucleus after injury inflicted by X -rays . Compounds like c9,t11-CLA , that specifically alter membrane properties , could be used to develop new anticancer strategies .
Lung cancer is primarily caused by exposure to tobacco smoke . Tobacco smoke contains numerous carcinogens , including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) . The most common PAH studied is benzo[a]pyrene ( B[a]P ) . B[a]P is metabolically activated through multiple routes , one of which is catalyzed by aldo-keto reductase ( AKR ) to B[a]P-7,8-dione ( BPQ ) . BPQ undergoes a futile redox cycle in the presence of NADPH to generate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . ROS , in turn , damages DNA . Studies with a yeast p53 mutagenesis system found that the generation of ROS by PAH o-quinones may contribute to lung carcinogenesis because of similarities between the patterns ( types of mutations ) and spectra ( location of mutations ) and those seen in lung cancer . The patterns were dominated by G to T transversions , and the spectra in the experimental system have mutations at lung cancer hotspots . To address repair mechanisms that are responsible for BPQ induced damage we observed the effect of mutating two DNA repair genes OGG1 and APE1 ( APN1 in yeast ) and tested them in a yeast reporter system for p53 mutagenesis . There was an increase in both the mutant frequency and the number of G:C/T:A transversions in p53 treated with BPQ in ogg1 yeast but not in apn1 yeast . Knocking out APN2 increased mutagenesis in the apn1 cells . In addition , we did not find a strand bias on p53 treated with BPQ in ogg1 yeast . These studies suggest that Ogg1 is involved in repairing the oxidative damage caused by BPQ , Apn1 and Apn2 have redundant functions and that the stand bias seen in lung cancer may not be due to impaired repair of oxidative lesions .
Chromosomal instability is the major form of genomic instability in cancer cells . Amongst various forms of chromosomal instability , pericentromeric or centromeric instability remains particularly poorly understood . In the present study , we found that pericentromeric instability , evidenced by dynamic formation of pericentromeric or centromeric rearrangements , breaks , deletions or iso-chromosomes , was a general phenomenon in human cells immortalized by expression of human papillomavirus type 16 E6 and E7 ( HPV16 E6E7 ) . In particular , for the first time , we surprisingly found a dramatic increase in the proportion of pericentromeric chromosomal aberrations relative to total aberrations in HPV16 E6E7-expressing cells 72 h after release from aphidicolin ( APH)-induced replication stress , with pericentromeric chromosomal aberrations becoming the predominant type of structural aberrations ( of total aberrations ) . In contrast , pericentromeric aberrations accounted for only about 20% of total aberrations in cells at the end of APH treatment . This increase in relative proportion of pericentromeric aberrations after release from APH treatment revealed that pericentromeric breaks induced by replication stress are refractory to prompt repair in HPV16 E6E7-expressing epithelial cells . Telomerase-immortalized epithelial cells without HPV16 E6E7 expression did not exhibit such preferential pericentromeric instability after release from APH treatment . Cancer development is often associated with replication stress . Since HPV16 E6 and E7 inactivate p53 and Rb , and p53 and Rb pathway defects are common in cancer , our finding that pericentromeric regions are refractory to prompt repair after replication stress-induced breakage in HPV16 E6E7-expressing cells may shed light on mechanism of general pericentromeric instability in cancer .
Molecular mechanisms involved in progression of clear-cell renal-cell carcinomas ( ccRCCs ) are poorly understood . A common genetic mutation found in ccRCC is the loss of the von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) gene , which contributes to cancer progression and metastasis . We investigated VIP effects on metastatic and angiogenic factors in human VHL-null A498 ccRCC and HK2 renal cells . VIP increased adhesion but decreased expression of metalloproteinases , MMP2 and MMP9 , as well as cell migration and VEGF expression and secretion in A498 but not in HK2 cells . VIP enhanced ROS levels and decreased nuclear levels of beta-catenin and NFkappaB p50-subunit in A498 cells , suggesting neuropeptide involvement in the observed decrease of metastatic ability in clear-cell carcinoma . VIP effects in A498 cells were blocked by the VPAC(1/2)-receptor antagonist JV-1-53 . In conclusion , present data point to a role of VIP in preventing invasion and metastasis in ccRCCs and support its potential therapeutic usefulness in this disease .
Angiogenesis is the process of new blood vessel formation from pre-existing ones . Angiogenic factors contribute to neovascularization that takes place in angiogenesis-dependent diseases , including cancer . Inhibiting the activity of the angiogenic factors to block the angiogenesis pathways is the current strategy of cancer therapy . Basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) is regarded as one of the most important angiogenic factors . Herein , we selected polyoxometalates ( POMs ) with different structures to study the interactions between bFGF and POMs . The results show that POMs could bind to the protein with high affinity , causing detectable changes in conformation and biophysical properties of protein . In addition , POMs could effectively inhibit the cell proliferation induced by bFGF . Significantly , we found that the structure , size and composition of POMs play a key role in the interactions between bFGF and POMs . This study will be meaningful for future screening and design of polyoxometalate-based anticancer drugs .
The triterpene saponin ginsenoside Rh2 has been shown to have antiproliferative effects on various cancer cells . However , the effect of Rh2 on the cell cycle and its underlying molecular mechanism in human leukemia cells are not fully understood . In this study , we found that Rh2 inhibited the proliferation of human leukemia cells concentration- and time-dependently with an IC(50) of <FFFD>M . DNA flow cytometric analysis indicated that Rh2 blocked cell cycle progression at the G(1) phase in HL-60 and U937 cells , and this was found to be accompanied by the downregulations of cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) 4 , CDK6 , cyclin D1 , cyclin D2 , cyclin D3 and cyclin E at the protein level . However , CDK inhibitors ( CDKIs ) , such as p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1) , were gradually upregulated after Rh2 treatment at the protein and messenger RNA ( mRNA ) levels . In addition , Rh2 markedly enhanced the bindings of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1) to CDK2 , CDK4 and CDK6 , and these bindings reduced CDK2 , CDK4 and CDK6 activities . Furthermore , Rh2 induced the differentiation of HL-60 cells as demonstrated by biochemical assays and the expression levels of cell surface antigens . In addition , treatment of HL-60 cells with Rh2 significantly increased transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) production , and cotreatment with TGF-beta neutralizing antibody prevented the Rh2-induced downregulations of CDK4 and CDK6 , upregulations of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1) levels and the induction of differentiation . These results demonstrate that the Rh2-mediated G(1) arrest and the differentiation are closely linked to the regulation of TGF-beta production in human leukemia cells .
Acrolein ( Acr ) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant found in cigarette smoke and automobile exhaust . It can also be produced endogenously by oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids . The Acr-derived 1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosine ( Acr-dG ) adducts in DNA are mutagenic lesions that are potentially involved in human cancers . In this study , monoclonal antibodies were raised against Acr-dG adducts and characterized using ELISA . They showed strong reactivity and specificity toward Acr-dG , weaker reactivity toward crotonaldehyde- and trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-derived 1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosines , and weak or no reactivity toward 1,N(6)-ethenodeoxyadenosine and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine . Using these antibodies , we developed assays to detect Acr-dG in vivo : first , a simple and quick FACS-based assay for detecting these adducts directly in cells ; second , a highly sensitive direct ELISA assay for measuring Acr-dG in cells and tissues using only 1 \u03bcg of DNA without DNA digestion and sample enrichment ; and third , a competitive ELISA for better quantitative measurement of Acr-dG levels in DNA samples . The assays were validated using Acr-treated HT29 cell DNA samples or calf thymus DNA , and the results were confirmed by LC-MS/MS-MRM . An immunohistochemical assay was also developed to detect and visualize Acr-dG in HT29 cells as well as in human oral cells . These antibody-based methods provide useful tools for the studies of Acr-dG as a cancer biomarker and of the molecular mechanisms by which cells respond to Acr-dG as a ubiquitous DNA lesion .
More than 50% of adults and of children with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) relapse following treatment . Dismal outcomes for patients with relapsed or refractory disease mandate novel approaches to therapy . We have previously shown that the combination of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 ( everolimus ) and the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine increases the survival of non-obese diabetic/severe combined immuno-deficient ( NOD/SCID ) mice bearing human ALL xenografts . We have also shown that 16 \u03bcM RAD001 synergized with agents that cause DNA damage or microtubule disruption in pre-B ALL cells in vitro . Here , we demonstrate that RAD001 has dose-dependent effects on the cell cycle in ALL cells , with 1.5 \u03bcM RAD001 inhibiting pRb , Ki67 and PCNA expression and increasing G0/1 cell cycle arrest , whereas 16 \u03bcM RAD001 increases pRb , cyclin D1 , Ki67 and PCNA , with no evidence of an accumulation of cells in G0/1 . Transition from G2 into mitosis was promoted by 16 \u03bcM RAD001 with reduced phosphorylation of cdc2 in cells with 4 N DNA content . However , 16 \u03bcM RAD001 preferentially induced cell death in cells undergoing mitosis . When combined with vincristine , 16 \u03bcM RAD001 reduced the vincristine-induced accumulation of cells in mitosis , probably as a result of increased death in this population . Although 16 \u03bcM RAD001 weakly activated Chk1 and Chk2 , it suppressed strong vincristine-induced activation of these cell cycle checkpoint regulators . We conclude that RAD001 enhances chemosensitivity at least in part through suppression of cell cycle checkpoint regulation in response to vincristine and increased progression from G2 into mitosis .
LewisY ( LeY ) antigen is an oligosaccharide that is highly expressed at the cell surface in various human cancers . Increased LeY expression activates epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) and promotes cell proliferation in EGFR-overexpressing cells . However , the effect of downregulation of LeY expression on cell proliferation in HER2-overexpressing cells remains unknown . FUT1 encodes alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase , a key enzyme for LeY synthesis . We knocked down FUT1 by short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) in four HER2-overexpressing human cancer cell lines , including NCI-N87 , MKN7 , SKBr3 and BT474 . We investigated whether downregulation of LeY and alteration in the glycosylation status of these cells affect cell proliferation and HER2 activation . Knocking down FUT1 expression markedly inhibited proliferation of NCI-N87 , which highly expressed EGFR and was sensitive to EGFR deprivation . Furthermore , FUT1 siRNA downregulated the total amount of HER2 protein , phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR , and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) in this cell line . Moreover , the marked downregulation of phosphorylation of HER2 and ERK was observed following short-time EGF-stimulation . These effects were not observed in the other three cell lines . Our results suggest that knockdown of FUT1 downregulates HER2 signaling via EGFR downregulation . FUT1 may serve as a new molecular target for HER2-overexpressing human cancers with activated EGFR signaling .
BACKGROUND Dickkopf-related protein 1 ( DKK1 ) has been reported involved in metastasis and invasion in several tumors . This study sought to investigate the prognostic value of DKK1 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC ) and its role in promoting ICC metastasis . METHODS Tissue microarrays of 138 ICC patient samples were employed to detect DKK1 , vascular endothelial growth factor C ( VEGF-C ) , and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP9 ) expression using immunohistochemistry . The prognostic significances were assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival estimates . DKK1 expression was measured in an ICC cell line ( HCCC-9810 ) and ICC tissues by immunofluorescence assay , quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction , and western blot . Serum levels of DKK1 from 37 ICC patients were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . The role of DKK1 in proliferation , migration , invasion , and gene expression regulation was assessed by DKK1 depletion using small interfering RNA . RESULTS Multivariate analyses revealed that DKK1 was an unfavorable predictor for overall survival and time to recurrence . The prognostic significance was retained in ICC patients with low recurrence risk ( P < .05 ) . DKK1 expression was elevated in an ICC cell line , tumor samples , and patient sera . High levels of DKK1 in ICC tissues correlated with elevated MMP9 , VEGF-C , and metastasis of hepatic hilar lymph nodes . DKK1 depletion caused a decrease in cell migration and invasiveness , and down-regulation of MMP9 and VEGF-C expression . CONCLUSIONS DKK1 is a novel prognostic biomarker for ICC , and it enhances tumor cell invasion and promotes lymph node metastasis of ICC through the induction of MMP9 and VEGF-C . DKK1 may be a potential therapeutic target for ICC .
17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases ( 17beta-HSDs ) catalyse the 17-position reduction / oxidation of steroids. 17beta-HSD type 3 ( 17beta-HSD3 ) catalyses the reduction of the weakly-androgenic androstenedione ( adione ) to testosterone , suggesting that specific inhibitors of 17beta-HSD3 may have a role in the treatment of hormone-dependent prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia . STX2171 is a novel selective non-steroidal 17beta-HSD3 inhibitor with an IC50 of nM in a whole cell assay . It inhibits adione-stimulated proliferation of 17beta-HSD3-expressing androgen receptor positive LNCaP[HSD3] prostate cancer cells in vitro . An androgen-stimulated LNCaP[HSD3] xenograft proof of concept model was developed to study the efficacies of STX2171 and a more established 17beta-HSD3 inhibitor , STX1383 ( SCH-451659 , Schering-Plough ) , in vivo . Castrated male MF-1 mice were inoculated s.c. with 1 x 107 cells 24 hours after an initial daily dose of testosterone propionate ( TP ) or vehicle . After 4 weeks tumors had not developed in vehicle-dosed mice , but were present in 50% of those mice given TP . One week after switching the stimulus to adione , mice were dosed additionally with vehicle or inhibitor for a further 4 weeks . Both TP and adione efficiently stimulated tumor growth and increased plasma testosterone levels , but in the presence of either 17beta-HSD3 inhibitor , adione-dependent tumor growth was significantly inhibited and plasma testosterone levels reduced . Mouse bodyweights were unaffected . Both inhibitors also significantly lowered plasma testosterone levels in intact mice . In conclusion , STX2171 and STX1383 significantly lower plasma testosterone levels and inhibit androgen-dependent tumor growth in vivo , indicating that 17beta-HSD3 inhibitors may have application in the treatment of hormone-dependent prostate cancer .
A prominent feature of inflammatory diseases is endothelial dysfunction . Factors associated with endothelial dysfunction include proinflammatory cytokines , adhesion molecules , and matrix degrading enzymes . At the transcriptional level , they are regulated by the histone deacetylase sirtuin ( SIRT ) 1 via its actions on the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) . The role of SIRT6 , also a histone deacetylase , in regulating inflammation in endothelial cells is not known . The aim of this study was to determine the effect of SIRT6 knockdown on inflammatory markers in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) in the presence of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . LPS decreased expression of SIRT6 in HUVECs . Knockdown of SIRT6 increased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-1beta , IL-6 , IL-8 ) , COX-prostaglandin system , ECM remodelling enzymes ( MMP-2 , MMP-9 and PAI-1 ) , the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 , and proangiogenic growth factors VEGF and FGF-2 ; cell migration ; cell adhesion to leukocytes . Loss of SIRT6 increased the expression of NF-kappaB , whereas overexpression of SIRT6 was associated with decreased NF-kappaB transcriptional activity . Taken together , these results demonstrate that the loss of SIRT6 in endothelial cells is associated with upregulation of genes involved in inflammation , vascular remodelling , and angiogenesis . SIRT6 may be a potential pharmacological target for inflammatory vascular diseases .
Endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor ( EG-VEGF ) has recently been identified as one of the vascular endothelial growth factors , and it is considered that the overexpression of EG-VEGF in colon cancer is related to hepatic metastasis . In this study , we report our recent novel findings of the involvement of EG-VEGF in cell invasion of colon cancer cells . Colon cancer cell lines ( DLD-1 and HCT116 ) with high expression of prokineticin receptor ( PK-R ) 1 and 2 were stimulated with the EG-VEGF protein . Furthermore , Matrigel cell invasion assay was performed to examine the changes in cancer cell invasion . In addition , we investigated the mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-2 , -7 and -9 in cancer cells . Finally , the EG-VEGF receptor on the colon cancer cell membrane was blocked by anti-PK-R1 and -PK-R2 antibodies to study whether cell invasion ability would be altered . In colon cancer cell lines where the expression of PK-R1 and 2 was confirmed , stimulation with EG-VEGF increased cell invasion a maximum of times . Furthermore , an increase in the mRNA and protein expression of MMP-2 , -7 and -9 was observed . We also observed that the cell invasion rate decreased only after exposure to the anti-PK-R2 antibody . The study showed that the EG-VEGF protein may act on MMP-2 , -7 and -9 via PK-R2 to strengthen cell invasion ability in colon cancer cell lines .
The present study investigates extracts of Neuolaena lobata , an anti-protozoan ethnomedicinal plant of the Maya , regarding its anti-neoplastic properties . Firstly , extracts of increasing polarity were tested in HL-60 cells analyzing inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis induction . Secondly , the most active extract was further tested in anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) cell lines of human and mouse origin . The dichloromethane extract inhibited proliferation of HL-60 , human and mouse ALCL cells with an IC50 of 3.7 and 2.4microg/ml , respectively and arrested cells in the G2/M phase . The extract induced the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 and perturbed the orchestrated expression of the Cdc25 family of cell cycle phosphatases which was paralleled by the activation of p53 , p21 and downregulation of c-Myc . Importantly , the expression of NPM/ALK and its effector JunB were drastically decreased , which correlated with the activation of caspase 3 . Subsequently also platelet derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 was downregulated , which was recently shown to be transcriptionally controlled by JunB synergizing with ALK in ALCL development . We show that a traditional healing plant extract downregulates various oncogenes , induces tumor suppressors , inhibits cell proliferation and triggers apoptosis of malignant cells . The discovery of the ' Active Principle(s) ' is warranted .
BACKGROUND Engineered zinc-finger nucleases ( ZFN ) represented an innovative method for the genome manipulation in vertebrates . ZFN introduced targeted DNA double strand breaks ( DSB ) and initiated non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) after pronuclear or cytoplasmatic microinjection into zygotes . Resulting frame shift mutations led to functional gene ablations in zebra fish , mice , pigs and also in laboratory rats . Therefore , we targeted the rat Rag1 gene essential for the V(D)J recombination within the immunoglobulin production process and for the differentiation of mature B and T lymphocytes to generate an immunodeficient rat model in the LEW/Ztm strain . RESULTS After microinjection of Rag1 specific ZFN mRNAs in 623 zygotes of inbred LEW/Ztm rats 59 offspring were born from which one carried a 4 bp deletion . This frame shift mutation led to a premature stop codon and a subsequently truncated Rag1 protein confirmed by the loss of the full-length protein in Western Blot analysis . Truncation of the Rag1 protein was characterized by the complete depletion of mature B cells . The remaining T cell population contained mature CD4+/CD3+/TCR\u03b1\u03b2+ as well as CD8+/CD3+/TCR\u03b1\u03b2+ positive lymphocytes accompanied by a compensatory increase of natural killer cells in the peripheral blood . Reduction of T cell development in Rag1 mutant rats was associated with a hypoplastic thymus that lacked follicular structures . Histological evaluation also revealed the near-complete absence of lymphocytes in spleen and lymph nodes in the immunodeficient Rag1 mutant rat . CONCLUSION The Rag1 mutant rat will serve as an important model for transplantation studies . Furthermore , it may be used as a model for reconstitution experiments related to the immune system , particularly with respect to different populations of human lymphocytes , natural killer cells and autoimmune phenomena .
Aberrant expression of mucins is likely associated with cancer biology as alterations in the expression and/or glycosylation patterns of various mucins have been noted . Expression of the mucin family in gastric cancers has been reported in numerous studies , but the results are conflicting . Therefore , we investigated the potential use of mucin ( MUC)1 and 4 as prognostic markers in gastric cancer according to histological subtype . Three-hundred and sixty-five gastric adenocarcinoma patients who underwent surgical resection were selected for this study . Among the 365 gastric cancer samples tested here , 34% consisted of early gastric cancer and 66% were advanced . In terms of location , 68.7% of the cohort had intestinal-type cancer and 30.7% had diffuse-type . We constructed tissue microarrays with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks of gastric cancer and these micro-arrays were evaluated for phenotypic expression of MUC1/4 using monoclonal antibodies . Two-hundred and ninety-two patients ( 92.7% ) were positive for MUC1 and 216 ( 60.5% ) were positive for MUC4 . MUC1 expression was not correlated with any other clinicopathological variables such as age , gender , depth of invasion , lymph node metastasis , Lauren classification or recurrence . However , loss of MUC4 expression was significantly correlated with recurrence ( p=0.033 ) . MUC4 expression was also significantly correlated with better disease-free survival ( p=0.049 ) and particularly in the intestinal-type ( p=0.018 ) . Our present findings demonstrated that loss of MUC4 expression can be used as a prognostic marker in gastric cancer . Loss of MUC4 expression is a prognostic indicator of increased recurrence and poor disease-free survival in patients with gastric cancer .
To investigate whether altered energy metabolism induces the Warburg effect and results in tumor malignancy , the respiratory enzyme citrate synthase ( CS ) was examined , silenced , and the effects analyzed . In human cervical carcinoma cells , RNAi-mediated CS knockdown induced morphological changes characteristic of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . This switch accelerated cancer cell metastasis and proliferation in in vitro assays and in vivo tumor xenograft models . Notably , CS knockdown cells exhibited severe defects in respiratory activity and marked decreases in ATP production , but great increases in glycolytic metabolism . This malignant progression was due to activation of EMT-related regulators ; altered energy metabolism resulted from deregulation of the p53/TIGAR and SCO2 pathways . This phenotypic change was completely reversed by p53 reactivation via treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 or co-knockdown of E3 ligase HDM2 and partially suppressed by ATP treatment . This study directly links the Warburg effect to tumor malignancy via induction of the EMT phenotype .
OBJECT A considerable body of evidence indicates that inflammation and angiogenesis play a significant role in the development and progression of chronic subdural hematoma ( CSDH ) . While various experimental and clinical studies have implicated placental growth factor ( PlGF ) in the processes that underpin pathological angiogenesis , no study has thus far investigated its expression in CSDH . The actions of PlGF and its related proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) are antagonized by a high-affinity soluble receptor , namely soluble VEGF receptor-1 ( sVEGFR-1 ) , and thus the ratio between sVEGFR-1 and angiogenic factors provides an index of angiogenic capacity . METHODS In the present study , using an automated electrochemiluminescence assay , levels of PlGF and sVEGFR-1 were quantified in serum and hematoma fluid obtained in 16 patients with CSDH . RESULTS Levels of PlGF and sVEGFR-1 were significantly higher in hematoma fluid than in serum ( p < 0.0001 ) . In serum , levels of sVEGFR-1 were higher than those of PlGF ( p < 0.0001 ) , whereas in hematoma fluid this difference was not apparent . Furthermore , the ratio of sVEGFR-1 to PlGF was significantly lower in hematoma fluid than in serum ( p < 0.0001 ) . CONCLUSIONS Given previous evidence indicating a role for PlGF in promoting angiogenesis , inflammatory cell chemotaxis , and stimulation , as well as its ability to amplify VEGF-driven signaling under conditions favoring pathological angiogenesis , enhanced expression of PlGF in hematoma fluid suggests the involvement of this factor in the mechanisms of inflammation and angiogenesis in CSDH . Furthermore , a reduced ratio of sVEGFR-1 to PlGF in hematoma fluid is consistent with the proangiogenic capacity of CSDH . Future studies are warranted to clarify the precise role of PlGF and sVEGFR-1 in CSDH .
BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Impairment of the immune system may contribute to the risk for having cancer as Toll-like receptors are important for innate immunity . We examined the association between candidate disease-susceptibility polymorphisms in the single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) like TLR2 ( -196 to-174del ) , TLR3 ( C1377T ) , TLR4 ( Thr399Ile ) and TLR9 ( G2848A ) genes in patients with bladder cancer in a North Indian population . METHODS : SNPs were comprised of TLR2 ( -196 to -174 Del ) , TLR3(C1377T) , TLR4 ( Thr399Ile ) and TLR9 ( G2848A ) genes . Allelic and genotypic frequencies of these TLRs SNP from histopathologically confirmed patients of bladder cancer ( n=200 ) and unrelated healthy controls of similar ethnicity ( n=200 ) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) analysis . RESULTS : In TLR2 I/D gene polymorphism , the combination of ID+DD showed a significant 3-fold increased risk ( p=0.001 ) . TLR2 with heterozygous genotype ID showed a 3-fold risk and combination of heterozygous and variant genotype ( ID+DD ) also showed a 5-fold risk with tumor stage/grade of patients with bladder cancer . The other genotypes of TLR3 , 4 and 9 did not exhibit any significant association with bladder cancer risk . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggested the involvement of TLR2 ( -196 to-174 del ) in bladder cancer susceptibility ; however , TLR3 , 4 and 9 genes were not associated with risk of bladder cancer , implicating that polymorphisms in these tested TLRs genes are not likely to be associated with increased risk for developing bladder cancer . Functional studies in ethnically diverse populations may provide a more comprehensive involvement of innate immunity in identifying the disease-associated variants for the etiology of bladder cancer .
DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) of simple base mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops in eukaryotes is initiated by the binding of the MutS homolog 2 ( MSH2)-MSH6 heterodimer to mismatched DNA . Cadmium ( Cd ) is a genotoxic heavy metal that has been recognized as a human carcinogen . Oxidant stress and inhibition of DNA repair have been proposed as major factors underlying Cd genotoxicity . Our previous studies indicated the ability of Cd to disturb the gene expression of MSH6 in zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) embryos . This study was undertaken to explore if Cd-induced oxidative stress down-regulated MSH gene activities . Following the exposure of zebrafish embryos at 1 h post fertilization ( hpf ) to sublethal concentrations of Cd at 3-5 \u03bcM for 4 or 9 h , a parallel down-regulation of MSH2 , MSH6 and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase ( Cu/Zn-SOD ) gene expression was detected by real-time RT-PCR and the expression levels were 40-50% of control after a 9-h exposure . Cd exposure also induced oxidative stress , yet no inhibition of catalase gene activity was observed . Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed a wide distribution of msh6 mRNA in the head regions of 10 hpf embryos and pretreatment of embryos with antioxidants butylhydroxytoluene ( BHT ) , d-mannitol or N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) at 1-10 \u03bcM restored Cd-suppressed msh6 expression . QPCR confirmed the protective effects of antioxidants on Cd-suppressed msh2/msh6 mRNA production . Down-regulated MSH gene activities reaching about 50% of control were also induced in embryos exposed to paraquat , a reactive oxygen species ( ROS)-generating herbicide , or hydrogen peroxide at 200 \u03bcM . Hence , Cd at sublethal levels down-regulates msh2/msh6 expression primarily via ROS as signaling molecules . The transcriptional activation of human msh6 is known to be fully dependent on the specificity factor 1 ( Sp1 ) . Cd failed to inhibit the DNA binding activity of zebrafish Sp1 unless at lethal concentrations based on band shift assay , therefore excluding the involvement of Sp1 inactivation in Cd-induced MSH gene inhibition in zebrafish embryos .
Eukaryotic High-Mobility Group B ( HMGB ) proteins alter DNA elasticity while facilitating transcription , replication and DNA repair . We developed a new single-molecule method to probe non-specific DNA interactions for two HMGB homologs : the human HMGB2 box A domain and yeast Nhp6Ap , along with chimeric mutants replacing neutral N-terminal residues of the HMGB2 protein with cationic sequences from Nhp6Ap . Surprisingly , HMGB proteins constrain DNA winding , and this torsional constraint is released over short timescales . These measurements reveal the microscopic dissociation rates of HMGB from DNA . Separate microscopic and macroscopic ( or local and non-local ) unbinding rates have been previously proposed , but never independently observed . Microscopic dissociation rates for the chimeric mutants ( s(-1) ) are higher than those observed for wild-type proteins ( s(-1) ) , reflecting their reduced ability to bend DNA through short-range interactions , despite their increased DNA-binding affinity . Therefore , transient local HMGB-DNA contacts dominate the DNA-bending mechanism used by these important architectural proteins to increase DNA flexibility .
Progression to malignancy requires that cells overcome senescence and switch to an immortal phenotype . Thus , exploring the genetic and epigenetic changes that occur during senescence/immortalization may help elucidate crucial events that lead to cell transformation . In the present study , we have globally profiled DNA methylation in relation to gene expression in primary , senescent and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts . Using a high-resolution genome-wide mapping technique , followed by extensive locus-specific validation assays , we have identified 24 CpG islands that display significantly higher levels of CpG methylation in immortalized cell lines as compared to primary murine fibroblasts . Several of these hypermethylated CpG islands are associated with genes involved in the MEK-ERK pathway , one of the most frequently disrupted pathways in cancer . Approximately half of the hypermethylated targets are developmental regulators , and bind to the repressive Polycomb group ( PcG ) proteins , often in the context of bivalent chromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells . Because PcG-associated aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of several human malignancies , our methylation data suggest that epigenetic reprogramming of pluripotency genes may initiate cell immortalization . Consistent with methylome alterations , global gene expression analysis reveals that the vast majority of genes dysregulated during cell immortalization belongs to gene families that converge into the MEK-ERK pathway . Additionally , several dysregulated members of the MAP kinase network show concomitant hypermethylation of CpG islands . Unlocking alternative epigenetic routes for cell immortalization will be paramount for understanding crucial events leading to cell transformation . Unlike genetic alterations , epigenetic changes are reversible events , and as such , can be amenable to pharmacological interventions , which makes them appealing targets for cancer therapy when genetic approaches prove inadequate .
We previously found that cancer metastasis is accelerated by immunosuppression during Snail-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . However , the molecular mechanism still remained unclear . Here , we demonstrate that CCL2 is a critical determinant for both tumor metastasis and immunosuppression induced by Snail(+) tumor cells . CCL2 is significantly upregulated in various human tumor cells accompanied by Snail expression induced by snail transduction or TGFbeta treatment . The Snail(+) tumor-derived CCL2 amplifies EMT events in other cells including Snail(-) tumor cells and epithelial cells within tumor microenvironment . CCL2 secondarily induces Lipocalin 2 ( LCN2 ) in the Snail(+) tumor cells in an autocrine manner . CCL2 and LCN2 cooperatively generate immunoregulatory dendritic cells ( DCreg ) having suppressive activity accompanied by lowered expression of costimulatory molecules such as HLA-DR but increased expression of immunosuppressive molecules such as PD-L1 in human PBMCs . The CCL2/LCN2-induced DCreg cells subsequently induce immunosuppressive CD4(+)FOXP3(+) Treg cells , and finally impair tumor-specific CTL induction . In murine established tumor model , however , CCL2 blockade utilizing the specific siRNA or neutralizing mAb significantly inhibits Snail(+) tumor growth and metastasis following systemic induction of anti-tumor immune responses in host . These results suggest that CCL2 is more than a chemoattractant factor that is the significant effector molecule responsible for immune evasion of Snail(+) tumor cells . CCL2 would be an attractive target for treatment to eliminate cancer cells via amelioration of tumor metastasis and immunosuppression .
Adoptive T cell therapy uses the specificity of the adaptive immune system to target cancer and virally infected cells . Yet the mechanism and means by which to enhance T cell function are incompletely described , especially in the skin . In this study , we use a murine model of immunotherapy to optimize cell-mediated immunity in the skin . We show that in vitro-derived central but not effector memory-like T cells bring about rapid regression of skin-expressing cognate Ag as a transgene in keratinocytes . Local inflammation induced by the TLR7 receptor agonist imiquimod subtly yet reproducibly decreases time to skin graft rejection elicited by central but not effector memory T cells in an immunodeficient mouse model . Local CCL4 , a chemokine liberated by TLR7 agonism , similarly enhances central memory T cell function . In this model , IL-2 facilitates the development in vivo of effector function from central memory but not effector memory T cells . In a model of T cell tolerogenesis , we further show that adoptively transferred central but not effector memory T cells can give rise to successful cutaneous immunity , which is dependent on a local inflammatory cue in the target tissue at the time of adoptive T cell transfer . Thus , adoptive T cell therapy efficacy can be enhanced if CD8(+) T cells with a central memory T cell phenotype are transferred , and IL-2 is present with contemporaneous local inflammation .
Escherichia coli pol V ( UmuD'(2)C ) , the main translesion DNA polymerase , ensures continued nascent strand extension when the cellular replicase is blocked by unrepaired DNA lesions . Pol V is characterized by low sugar selectivity , which can be further reduced by a Y11A " steric-gate " substitution in UmuC that enables pol V to preferentially incorporate rNTPs over dNTPs in vitro . Despite efficient error-prone translesion synthesis catalyzed by UmuC_Y11A in vitro , strains expressing umuC_Y11A exhibit low UV mutability and UV resistance . Here , we show that these phenotypes result from the concomitant dual actions of Ribonuclease HII ( RNase HII ) initiating removal of rNMPs from the nascent DNA strand and nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) removing UV lesions from the parental strand . In the absence of either repair pathway , UV resistance and mutagenesis conferred by umuC_Y11A is significantly enhanced , suggesting that the combined actions of RNase HII and NER lead to double-strand breaks that result in reduced cell viability . We present evidence that the Y11A-specific UV phenotype is tempered by pol IV in vivo . At physiological ratios of the two polymerases , pol IV inhibits pol V-catalyzed translesion synthesis ( TLS ) past UV lesions and significantly reduces the number of Y11A-incorporated rNTPs by limiting the length of the pol V-dependent TLS tract generated during lesion bypass in vitro . In a recA730 lexA(Def) \u0394umuDC \u0394dinB strain , plasmid-encoded wild-type pol V promotes high levels of spontaneous mutagenesis . However , umuC_Y11A-dependent spontaneous mutagenesis is only of that observed with wild-type pol V , but increases to of wild-type levels in an isogenic \u0394rnhB strain and of wild-type levels in a \u0394rnhA \u0394rnhB double mutant . Our observations suggest that errant ribonucleotides incorporated by pol V can be tolerated in the E. coli genome , but at the cost of higher levels of cellular mutagenesis .
Thrombospondin-1 is a matricellular protein with potent antitumour activities , the levels of which determine the fate of many different tumours , including renal carcinomas . However , the factors that regulate this protein remain unclear . In renal carcinomas , hypoxic conditions enhance the expression of angiogenic factors that help adapt tumour cells to their hostile environment . Therefore , we hypothesized that anti-angiogenic factors should correspondingly be dampened . Indeed , we found that hypoxia decreased the thrombospondin-1 protein in several clear cell renal carcinoma cell lines ( ccRCC ) , although no transcriptional regulation was observed . Furthermore , we proved that hypoxia stimulates multiple signals that independently contribute to diminish thrombospondin-1 in ccRCC , which include a decrease in the activity of oxygen-dependent prolylhydroxylases ( PHDs ) and activation of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway . In addition , thrombospondin-1 regulation in hypoxia proved to be important for ccRCC cell migration and invasion .
DNA damage induced by benzene and its metabolites is thought of as an important mechanism underlying benzene genotoxicity in chronic benzene poisoning ( CBP ) . Therefore , genetic variation in DNA repair genes may contribute to susceptibility to CBP in the exposed population . Since benzene-induced DNA damages include DNA adducts , we hypothesized that the polymorphisms of ERCC1 ( Excision repair cross complementation group 1 ) and ERCC2/XPD ( Excision repair cross complementation group 2/xeroderma pigmentosum group D ) are associated with the risk of CBP . A case-control study involving 102 benzene-poisoned patients and 204 none-benzene-poisoned controls occupationally exposed to benzene was carried out in the Northeast region of China . The polymorphisms of codon 118 ( rs11615 ) and C8092A ( rs3212986 ) of ERCC1 , codon 751 ( rs13181 ) , 312 ( rs1799793 ) and 156 ( rs238406 ) of ERCC2/XPD were genotyped by TaqMan((R)) Real-time PCR . The results showed that individuals carrying the ERCC1 codon 118 TT genotype had an increased risk of CBP ( OR(adj)=3.390 ; 95%CI : 1.393-8.253 ; P=0.007 ) comparing with its CC genotype . After stratified by smoking , gender and exposure duration we found that the increased risk of CBP associated with the ERCC1 codon 118 TT genotype confined to nonsmokers ( OR=3.214 ; 95% CI : 1.359-7.601 ; P=0.006 ) , female ( OR=3.049 ; 95% CI : 1.235-7.529 ; P=0.013 ) and exposure duration> 12 years ( OR=3.750 ; 95% CI : 1.041-13.513 ; P=0.035 ) . Since ERCC1 and ERCC2/XPD are both located on chromosome 19q13.3 , haplotype analysis of all 5 SNPs was also conducted . However no correlations between the risks of CBP and other genotypes or haplotypes were found . Therefore , our findings suggest an important role of ERCC1 codon 118 polymorphisms for a biomarker to CBP in the Chinese occupational population .
Tumor development requires angiogenesis and anti-angiogenic therapies have been introduced in the treatment of cancer . In this context , heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( HSPGs ) emerge as interesting targets , owing to their function as co-receptors of major , pro-angiogenic factors . Accordingly , previous studies have suggested anti-tumor effects of heparin , i.e. over-sulfated HS , and various heparin mimetics ; however , a significant drawback is their unspecific mechanism of action and potentially serious side-effects related to their anticoagulant properties . Here , we have explored the use of human ScFv anti-HS antibodies ( alphaHS ) as a more rational approach to target HSPG function in endothelial cells ( ECs). alphaHS were initially selected for their recognition of HS epitopes localized preferentially to the vasculature of patient glioblastoma tumors , i.e. highly angiogenic brain tumors . Unexpectedly , we found that these alphaHS exhibited potent pro-angiogenic effects in primary human ECs. alphaHS were shown to stimulate EC differentiation , which was associated with increased EC tube formation and proliferation . Moreover , alphaHS supported EC survival under hypoxia and starvation , i.e. conditions typical of the tumor microenvironment . Importantly , alphaHS-mediated proliferation was efficiently counter-acted by heparin and was absent in HSPG-deficient mutant cells , confirming HS-specific effects . On a mechanistic level , binding of alphaHS to HSPGs of ECs as well as glioblastoma cells was found to trigger p38 MAPK-dependent signaling resulting in increased proliferation . We conclude that several alphaHS that recognize HS epitopes abundant in the tumor vasculature may elicit a pro-angiogenic response , which has implications for the development of antibody-based targeting of HSPGs in cancer .
Metastasis is a major cause of death of patients with malignant tumors . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are important for the migration and invasion of various types of cancer cell . Propofol is a known anesthetic agent , widely used for short-term anesthesia and for longer-term sedation . Propofol inhibits the proliferation of a variety of tumor cells , but there is no available information regarding propofol-inhibited migration and invasion of tumor cells in vitro . In this study , we investigated the effects of propofol on the migration and invasion of human lung carcinoma A549 cells . Wound healing assay and Boyden chamber assays indicated that propofol inhibited the migration and invasion of A549 cells in vitro . Gelatin zymographic analysis showed the inhibitory effect of propofol on the activation of expression MMP-2 . Western blot analysis also indicated that propofol suppressed the protein expiration of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 ( GRB2 ) , Jun N-terminal kinases 1/2 ( p-JNK1/2 ) , p-p38 , MMP-2 and MMP-9 in A549 cells . Results from real-time PCR assay also showed that propofol inhibited the mRNA gene expression of MMP-2 , -7 and -9 , and enhanced that of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 ( TIMP1 ) and TIMP2 in A549 cells . Taken together , these data show that propofol inhibits MMP-2 and -9 mRNA and protein expressions , resulting in suppression of lung cancer cell invasion and migration in vitro .
OBJECTIVE To study the mechanism of interleukin 7/interleukin 7 receptor ( IL-7/IL-7R ) in promoting cell proliferation and inducing lymphangiogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) in vivo and in vitro . METHODS Immunohistochemical study for IL-7 , IL-7R , cyclin D1 and vascular endothelial growth factor-D ( VEGF-D ) was carried out in NSCLC tissues from 95 patients . The relationship between IL-7/IL-7R expression and various parameters was analyzed . The mechanism of IL-7/IL-7R in promoting cell proliferation and inducing lymphangiogenesis was studied by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide , fluorescence-activated cell sorting , reverse transcriptase-PCR , Western blot , co-immunoprecipitation , chromatin immunoprecipitation and nude mice experiments with xenograft tumors . RESULTS IL-7 ( 63.2% , 60/95 ) , IL-7R ( 61.1% , 58/95 ) , cyclin D1 ( 52.6% , 50/95 ) and VEGF-D ( 58.9% , 56/95 ) showed that high level of expression in NSCLC . IL-7/IL-7R over-expression correlated with cyclin D1 expression ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.01 ) , VEGF-D expression ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.01 ) , increased lymphovascular density ( P = 0.005 , P = 0.013 ) , advanced clinical stage ( P = 0.008 , P = 0.005 ) and presence of lymph node metastasis ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.01 ) . IL-7/IL-7R could promote proliferation of A549 cell , increase cyclin D1 and VEGF-D expression , and enhance c-Fos/c-Jun expression and phosphorylation , resulting in formation of heterodimer . Furthermore , IL-7/IL-7R could induce binding of c-Fos/c-Jun to cyclin D1/VEGF-D promoters and regulate their transcription . IL-7/IL-7R could also promote proliferation and lymphangiogenesis of lung cancer xenograft tumors . CONCLUSIONS IL-7/IL-7R promotes c-Fos/c-Jun expression and activity in NSCLC . This further facilitates cyclin D1 expression and accelerates proliferation of cells and VEGF-D-induced lymphovascular formation .
OBJECTIVE To investigate the mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in tumor tissue and pleural effusion in advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients , and to analyze the relationship between EGFR mutations and the clinicopathologic characteristics . METHODS Two-hundred and forty-one cases of formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tumor tissues and 14 paired pleural effusions from advanced NSCLC patients were collected . Twenty-nine different EGFR mutations in exons 18-21 were assessed by scorpions and amplification refractory mutation system ( scorpions ARMS ) using real time PCR . The relationship between the EGFR mutations and clinical parameters was analyzed using statistical methods . EGFR mutation of 37 cases were detected with direct sequencing , and assessed the sensitivity , the specificity and the accuracy of scorpions ARMS . RESULTS EGFR somatic mutations were detected in 114 of 234 advanced NSCLC patients , with the mutation rate of 48.7% , including deletions in exon 19 in 65 patients and point mutation of L858R in exon 21 in 39 patients ; both accounting for 91.2% ( 104/114 ) of all types of EGFR mutations . The test results of 14 paired pleural effusion specimens were entirely the same to the tissues . The concordance rate of 2 different detection methods was 94.6% . Mutation rate was higher in women ( 55.9% ) than in men ( 42.2% ) , and there was no difference in mutation rates between smokers and non-smokers ; patients in stage IIIB and stage IV ; adenocarcinoma and non-adenocarcinoma . CONCLUSIONS EGFR somatic mutations appear to occur frequently in Chinese . Scorpions ARMS technology is a sensitive method to detect EGFR mutations and is suitable for screening patients who would likely respond to EGFR inhibitors therapy .
OBJECTIVE To explore the efficacy and side effects of icotinib hydrochloride in the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . METHODS The efficacy and side effects of icotinib hydrochloride in treatment of 59 cases with stage IV NSCIC and followed-up from March 2009 to January 2012 were retrospectively analyzed . RESULTS Twenty seven patients ( 45.8% ) showed partial response ( PR ) , 17 patients ( 28.8% ) achieved SD , and 15 ( 25.4% ) had progressive disease . The objective response rate ( ORR ) was 45.8% ( 27/59 ) , and disease control rate ( DCR ) was 74.6% ( 44/59 ) . Among the 23 patients with EGFR mutation , ORR was 73.9% ( 17/23 ) , and DCR was 95.7% ( 22/23 ) . Thirty six patients ( 61.0% ) achieved remission of symptoms to varying degrees . The main symptoms relieved were cough , asthmatic suffocating , pain and hoarseness . The major adverse events were mild skin rash ( 35.6% ) and diarrhea ( 15.3% ) . Others were dry skin , nausea and stomach problems . The efficacy of icotinib hydrochloride were related to the ECOG performance status , smoking history , EGFR mutation and rash significantly ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS Monotherapy with icotinib hydrochloride is effective and tolerable for patients with advanced NSCLC , especially with EGFR mutation .
In response to genotoxic stress , a transient arrest in cell-cycle progression enforced by the DNA-damage checkpoint ( DDC ) signalling pathway positively contributes to genome maintenance . Because hyperactivated DDC signalling can lead to a persistent and detrimental cell-cycle arrest , cells must tightly regulate the activity of the kinases involved in this pathway . Despite their importance , the mechanisms for monitoring and modulating DDC signalling are not fully understood . Here we show that the DNA-repair scaffolding proteins Slx4 and Rtt107 prevent the aberrant hyperactivation of DDC signalling by lesions that are generated during DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . On replication stress , cells lacking Slx4 or Rtt107 show hyperactivation of the downstream DDC kinase Rad53 , whereas activation of the upstream DDC kinase Mec1 remains normal . An Slx4-Rtt107 complex counteracts the checkpoint adaptor Rad9 by physically interacting with Dpb11 and phosphorylated histone H2A , two positive regulators of Rad9-dependent Rad53 activation . A decrease in DDC signalling results from hypomorphic mutations in RAD53 and H2A and rescues the hypersensitivity to replication stress of cells lacking Slx4 or Rtt107 . We propose that the Slx4-Rtt107 complex modulates Rad53 activation by a competition-based mechanism that balances the engagement of Rad9 at replication-induced lesions . Our findings show that DDC signalling is monitored and modulated through the direct action of DNA-repair factors .
BACKGROUND Thymidine phosphorylase ( TYMP ) is an angiogenic factor that has potent chemotactic activity for endothelial cells and is involved in 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) metabolism . In colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , previous studies evaluating the relationship between TYMP expression and clinicopathological features have yielded inconsistent results . The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of TYMP , its association with other angiogenic factors , proliferation markers and , to our knowledge , for the first time its relationship with extracellular matrix components . MATERIALS AND METHODS Formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded specimens from 97 patients with CRC were immunostained for TYMP , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , microvascular density ( CD34 ) , proliferation marker ( Ki-67 ) , proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) , p53 oncoprotein and extracellular matrix components ( collagen type IV , fibronectin , tenascin and laminin ) . Survival curves were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method . RESULTS Immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasm ( cyt ) and nucleus ( n ) of the tumor cells , as well in the stroma ( st ) , endothelium and tumor-associated macrophages . High TYMPcyt expression was observed in 7.2% of the cases , moderate in 22.7% and weak in 59.9% , while 10.3% were negative . High TYMPst expression was observed in 58.8% of the cases . TYMPcyt expression was correlated with the VEGF expression of tumor cells and VEGF expression of vessels ( p=0.014 and p=0.022 , respectively ) . TYMPst expression was correlated with VEGF expression and tenascin ( p=0.014 and p=0.011 , respectively ) . Patients with higher TYMPcyt expression had a more favorable overall survival ( p=0.041 ) in univariate analysis compared to patients without TYMP expression . CONCLUSION These findings suggest that TYMP plays an important role in angiogenesis , extracellular matrix remodeling and in the prognosis of patients with CRC , but further studies are needed to clearly define its role in CRC .
An epidemiological survey was conducted in the Seine estuary and in two smaller and relatively preserved estuaries on the French Atlantic coast in order to estimate the occurrence of liver lesions in European flounder , Platichthys flesus , and also to seek putative risk factors for the recorded pathologies . Four hundred and seventy-eight fish of both sexes and of different size ranges were sampled in the three studied areas , 338 of which in the Seine estuary . All fish were examined for histopathological liver lesions , while DNA adducts and otoliths were analyzed on a subsample . Five categories of hepatic lesions were recorded with the following prevalence for the Seine estuary : 36.7 % inflammations , 8 % parasites ( mainly encysted nematodes ) , 6.5 % foci of cellular alteration ( FCA ) , 5.3 % foci of necrosis or regeneration ( FNR ) , and 1.5 % tumors . Inflammation occurrence increased according to age , contrary to parasitic infestations and FCA which were more prevalent in young fish , notably those of <1 year old ( group 0 ) . Tumors were only observed in females of more than two winters . Females exhibited a higher prevalence of tumors ( 3.0 % ) and FCA ( 6.5 % ) than males ( 0 and 2.6 % , respectively ) . Parasitic and infectious lesions and FNR were equally distributed in males and females . The prevalence of FNR was also shown to vary according to sampling season , with significantly more occurrences of liver necrosis in the fish collected in summer than in spring . Spatial differences were observed with a higher occurrence of encysted parasites in flounders from the upper Seine estuary , while inflammations predominated in flounders living downstream . Temporal trends were also noted , with an increased prevalence of parasitic infestations , inflammations , and FCA in the 2002-2003 period in comparison to the 1996-1997 one . The three flounder populations from the Seine estuary ( Normandy ) , Ster estuary ( Brittany ) , and Bay of Veys ( Normandy ) showed different spectra of hepatic lesions . Flounders from the Bay of Veys had relatively few liver lesions as compared to flounders from the two other estuaries . Flounders from the Ster estuary exhibited the highest prevalence of parasites ( 37.2 % ) and inflammations ( 51.1 % ) . Finally , FCA and liver tumors occurred at very similar levels in both flounder populations from the Seine and the Ster estuaries . Group 0 flounders inhabiting the upper Seine estuary were more prone to parasitic and pre-neoplastic hepatic lesions and had higher levels of liver DNA adducts than the older ones living downstream . It was postulated that group 0 European flounders may serve as valuable bioindicators for assessing the quality of estuarine waters and the health status of euryhaline fish populations .
Missense substitutions of uncertain clinical significance in the BRCA1 gene are a vexing problem in genetic counseling for women who have a family history of breast cancer . In this study , we evaluated the functions of 29 missense substitutions of BRCA1 in two DNA repair pathways . Repair of double-strand breaks by homology-directed recombination ( HDR ) had been previously analyzed for 16 of these BRCA1 variants , and 13 more variants were analyzed in this study . All 29 variants were also analyzed for function in double-strand break repair by the single-strand annealing ( SSA ) pathway . We found that among the pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 , all were defective for DNA repair by either pathway . The HDR assay was accurate because all pathogenic mutants were defective for HDR , and all nonpathogenic variants were fully functional for HDR . Repair by SSA accurately identified pathogenic mutants , but several nonpathogenic variants were scored as defective or partially defective . These results indicated that specific amino acid residues of the BRCA1 protein have different effects in the two related DNA repair pathways , and these results validate the HDR assay as highly correlative with BRCA1-associated breast cancer .
A key requirement for the development of cancer immunotherapy is the identification of tumour-associated antigens that are differentially or exclusively expressed on the tumour and recognized by the host immune system . However , immune responses to such antigens are often muted or lacking due to the antigens being recognized as " self " , and further complicated by the tumour environment and regulation of immune cells within . In an effort to circumvent the lack of immune responses to tumour antigens , we have devised a strategy to develop potential synthetic immunogens . The strategy , termed mirror image phage display , is based on the concept of molecular mimicry as demonstrated by the idiotype/anti-idiotype paradigm in the immune system . Here as ' proof of principle ' we have selected molecular mimics of the well-characterised tumour associated antigen , the human mucin1 protein ( MUC1 ) from two different peptide phage display libraries . The putative mimics were compared in structure and function to that of the native antigen . Our results demonstrate that several of the mimic peptides display T-cell stimulation activity in vitro when presented by matured dendritic cells . The mimic peptides and the native MUC1 antigenic epitopes can cross-stimulate T-cells . The data also indicate that sequence homology and/or chemical properties to the original epitope are not the sole determining factors for the observed immunostimulatory activity of the mimic peptides .
Colon cancer is the third most common malignant neoplasm in the world and it remains an important cause of death , especially in western countries . The toxic environmental pollutant , 1 , 2-dimethylhydrazine ( DMH ) , is also a colon-specific carcinogen . Tannic acid ( TA ) is reported to be effective against various types of chemically induced toxicity and also carcinogenesis . In the present study , we evaluated the chemopreventive efficacy of TA against DMH induced colon toxicity in a rat model . Efficacy of TA against the colon toxicity was evaluated in terms of biochemical estimation of antioxidant enzyme activities , lipid peroxidation , histopathological changes and expression of early molecular markers of inflammation and tumor promotion . DMH treatment induced oxidative stress enzymes ( p<0.001 ) and an early inflammatory and tumor promotion response in the colons of Wistar rats . TA treatment prevented deteriorative effects induced by DMH through a protective mechanism that involved reduction of oxidative stress as well as COX-2 , i-NOS , PCNA protein expression levels and TNF-alpha(p<0.001) release . It could be concluded from our results that TA markedly protects against chemically induced colon toxicity and acts plausibly by virtue of its antioxidant , anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activities .
Breast cancer causes death due to distant metastases in which tumor cells produce matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) enzymes which facilitate invasion . Oleuropein , the main olive oil polyphenol , has anti-proliferative effects . This study aimed to investigate the effect of oleuropein on the metastatic and anti-metastatic gene expression in the MDA human breast cancer cell line . We evaluated the MMPs and TIMPs gene expression by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) in treated and untreated cells . This study demonstrated that OL may induce anti-metastatic effects on human breast cancer cells . We found that TIMP1,-3 , and -4 were over-expressed after all periods of incubation in treated cancer cells compared to untreated cells , while MMP2 and MMP9 genes were down-regulated , at least initially . Treatment of breast cancer cells with oleuropein could help in prevention of cancer metastasis by increasing the TIMPs and suppressing the MMPs gene expressions .
Senescence is a cellular response preventing tumorigenesis . The Ras oncogene is frequently activated or mutated in human cancers , but Ras activation is insufficient to transform primary cells . Ina search for cooperating oncogenes , we identify the lysine demethylase JMJD2A/KDM4A . We show that JMJD2A functions as a negative regulator of Ras-induced senescence and collaborates with oncogenic Ras to promote cellular transformation by negatively regulating the p53 pathway . We find CHD5 , a known tumor suppressor regulating p53 activity , as a target of JMJD2A . The expression of JMJD2A inhibits Ras-mediated CHD5 induction leading to a reduced activity of the p53 pathway . In addition , we show that JMJD2A is overexpressed inmouse and human lung cancers . Depletion of JMJD2A in the human lung cancer cell line A549 bearing an activated K-Ras allele triggers senescence . We propose that JMJD2A is an oncogene that represents a target for Ras-expressing tumors .
The anthracycline doxorubicin is a widely used effective anti-cancer drug . However , its application and dosage are severely limited due to its cardiotoxicity . The exact mechanisms of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxic side effects remain poorly understood . Even less is known about the impact of doxorubicin treatment on vascular damage . We found that low doses of doxorubicin induced a senescent response in human primary vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMC ) . We observed that expression of urokinase receptor ( uPAR ) was upregulated in response to doxorubicin . Furthermore , the level of uPAR expression played a decisive role in developing doxorubicin-induced senescence. uPAR silencing in human VSMC by means of RNA interference as well as uPAR knockout in mouse VSMC resulted in abrogation of doxorubicin-induced cellular senescence . On the contrary , uPAR overexpression promoted VSMC senescence . We further found that proteasomal degradation of telomeric repeat binding factor 2 ( TRF2 ) mediates doxorubicin-induced VSMC senescence . Our results demonstrate that uPAR controls the ubiquitin-proteasome system in VSMC and regulates doxorubicin-induced TRF2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation via this mechanism . Therefore , VSMC senescence induced by low doses of doxorubicin may contribute to vascular damage upon doxorubicin treatment. uPAR-mediated TRF2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are further identified as a molecular mechanism underlying this process .
Common fragile sites ( CFSs ) are hot spots of chromosomal breakage , and CFS breakage models involve perturbations of DNA replication . Here , we analyzed the contribution of specific repetitive DNA sequence elements within CFSs to the inhibition of DNA synthesis by replicative and specialized DNA polymerases ( Pols ) . The efficiency of in vitro DNA synthesis was quantitated using templates corresponding to regions within FRA16D and FRA3B harboring AT-rich microsatellite and quasi-palindrome ( QP ) sequences . QPs were predicted to form stems of self-homology , separated by 3-9 bases of intervening sequences . Analysis of DNA synthesis progression by human Pol \u03b4 demonstrated significant synthesis perturbation both at [ A](n) and [ TA](n) repeats in a length-dependent manner and at short ( <40 base pairs ) QP sequences . DNA synthesis by the Y-family polymerase \u03ba was significantly more efficient than Pol \u03b4 through both types of repetitive elements . Using DNA trap experiments , we show that Pol \u03b4 pauses within CFS sequences are sites of enzyme dissociation , and dissociation was observed in the presence of RFC-loaded PCNA . We propose that enrichment of microsatellite and QP elements at CFS regions contributes to fragility by perturbing replication through multiple mechanisms , including replicative Pol pausing and dissociation . Our finding that Pol \u03b4 dissociates at specific CFS sequences is significant , since dissociation of the replication machinery and inability to efficiently recover the replication fork can lead to fork collapse and/or formation of double-strand breaks in vivo . Our biochemical studies also extend the potential involvement of Y-family polymerases in CFS maintenance to include polymerase \u03ba .
OBJECTIVE To explore the clinical significance of miRNA-216a expression in pancreatic cancer . METHODS Fourteen patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy and 6 patients with benign pancreas lesions were examined for miR-216a expressions in the tumor or lesion tissues using Agilent Human miRNA Microarray ( V12.0 ) . The relationship between miR-216a expressions and the clinicopathological features of the patients was analyzed . RESULTS The expression of miRNA-216a was significantly lower in pancreatic cancer than in benign pancreas lesions ( P=0.000 ) . The expression of miRNA-216a was significantly correlated with the T stage of the tumor ( P=0.002 ) , but not with the patients ' age , gender , smoking status , tumor stage , lymph node metastases , distant metastasis , tumor differentiation , nerve invasion , vessel invasion or serum CA19-9 level ( P>0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS The down-regulated expression of miR-216a in pancreatic cancer suggests the involvement of miR-216a in the tumorigenesis and development of pancreatic cancer. miR-216a may potentially serve as a novel tumor marker and also a prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer .
PURPOSE We did this retrospective study to explore the association between epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation and clinical features in postoperative recurrent female non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed clinical data on 86 female patients who had postoperative recurrent disease between December 1992 and July 2007 . The start of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy was treated as a censoring event . Corresponding surgical specimens of primary tumors were used to test for EGFR mutations . RESULTS Thirty patients presented with local recurrence and distant recurrence was identified in 56 . Thirty-four of the 86 patients ( 40% ) harbored EGFR mutations . Patients with distant recurrence were more likely to have EGFR mutations than patients with local recurrence ( 48% versus 23% ; P = 0.024 ) . On multivariate analysis , distant recurrence was associated with a high frequency of EGFR mutations ( OR , 3.3 ; P = 0.028 ) . Survival analysis showed poor survival of patients with mutated EGFR ( HR , 2.3 ; P = 0.017 ) or with non-adenocarcinoma histology ( HR , 3.3 ; P = 0.001 ) . CONCLUSION The association between recurrence pattern and EGFR mutation status was suggested in recurrent female NSCLC patients . In addition , our data indicate unfavorable disease process of EGFR mutated tumors . Further studies need to be conducted to validate these findings .
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) likely play a role in many cancers even in never-smokers . We tried to find a model to explain the relationship between variation in PAH-related DNA adduct levels among people with similar exposures , multiple genetic polymorphisms in genes related to metabolic and repair pathways , and nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) capacity . In 111 randomly selected female never-smokers from the Golestan Cohort Study in Iran , we evaluated 21 SNPs in 14 genes related to xenobiotic metabolism and 12 SNPs in eight DNA repair genes . NER capacity was evaluated by a modified comet assay , and aromatic DNA adduct levels were measured in blood by32P-postlabeling . Multivariable regression models were compared by Akaike's information criterion ( AIC ) . Aromatic DNA adduct levels ranged between 1.7 and 18.6 per 10(8) nucleotides ( mean : 5.8 +/- 3.1 ) . DNA adduct level was significantly lower in homozygotes for NAT2 slow alleles and ERCC5 non-risk-allele genotype , and was higher in the MPO homozygote risk-allele genotype . The sum of risk alleles in these genes significantly correlated with the log-adduct level ( r = 0.4 , p < 0.001 ) . Compared with the environmental model , adding Phase I SNPs and NER capacity provided the best fit , and could explain 17% more of the variation in adduct levels . NER capacity was affected by polymorphisms in the MTHFR and ERCC1 genes . Female non-smokers in this population had PAH-related DNA adduct levels three to four times higher than smokers and occupationally-exposed groups in previous studies , with large inter-individual variation which could best be explained by a combination of Phase I genes and NER capacity .
Metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells provides energy and multiple intermediates critical for cell growth . Hypoxia in tumors represents a hostile environment that can encourage these transformations . We report that glycogen metabolism is upregulated in tumors invivo and in cancer cells invitro in response to hypoxia . Invitro , hypoxia induced an early accumulation of glycogen , followed bya gradual decline . Concordantly , glycogen synthase ( GYS1 ) showed a rapid induction , followed by a later increase of glycogen phosphorylase ( PYGL ) . PYGL depletion and the consequent glycogen accumulation led to increased reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) levels that contributed to a p53-dependent induction of senescence and markedly impaired tumorigenesis invivo . Metabolic analyses indicated that glycogen degradation by PYGL is important for the optimal function of the pentose phosphate pathway . Thus , glycogen metabolism is a key pathway induced by hypoxia , necessary for optimal glucose utilization , which represents a targetable mechanism of metabolic adaptation .
Pyruvate kinase M2 ( PKM2 ) is upregulated in multiple cancer types and contributes to the Warburg effect by unclear mechanisms . Here we demonstrate that EGFR-activated ERK2 binds directly to PKM2 Ile429/Leu431 through the ERK2 docking groove and phosphorylates PKM2 at Ser37 , but does not phosphorylate PKM1 . Phosphorylated PKM2 Ser37 recruits PIN1 for cis-trans isomerization of PKM2 , which promotes PKM2 binding to importin \u03b15 and translocating to the nucleus . Nuclear PKM2 acts as a coactivator of \u03b2-catenin to induce c-Myc expression , resulting in the upregulation of GLUT1 , LDHA and , in a positive feedback loop , PTB-dependent PKM2 expression . Replacement of wild-type PKM2 with a nuclear translocation-deficient mutant ( S37A ) blocks the EGFR-promoted Warburg effect and brain tumour development in mice . In addition , levels of PKM2 Ser37 phosphorylation correlate with EGFR and ERK1/2 activity in human glioblastoma specimens . Our findings highlight the importance of nuclear functions of PKM2 in the Warburg effect and tumorigenesis .
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein consisting of a catalytic subunit , the telomerase reverse transcriptase , TERT , and an integrally associated RNA , TR , which contains a template for the synthesis of short repetitive G-rich DNA sequences at the ends of telomeres . Telomerase can repetitively reverse transcribe its short RNA template , acting processively to add multiple telomeric repeats onto the same DNA substrate . The contribution of enzyme processivity to telomere length regulation in human cells is not well characterized . In cancer cells , under homeostatic telomere length-maintenance conditions , telomerase acts processively , while under nonequilibrium conditions , telomerase acts distributively on the shortest telomeres . To investigate the role of increased telomerase processivity on telomere length regulation in human cells with limited lifespan that are dependent on human TERT ( hTERT ) for lifespan extension and immortalization , we mutated the leucine at position 866 in the reverse transcriptase C motif of hTERT to a tyrosine ( L866Y ) , which is the amino acid found at a similar position in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase . We report that , similar to the previously reported ' gain of function ' Tetrahymena telomerase mutant ( L813Y ) , the human telomerase variant displays increased processivity. hTERT-L866Y , like wild-type hTERT can immortalize and extend the lifespan of limited lifespan cells . Moreover , hTERT-L866Y expressing cells display heterogenous telomere lengths , telomere elongation , multiple telomeric signals indicative of fragile sites and replicative stress , and an increase in short telomeres , which is accompanied by telomere trimming events . Our results suggest that telomere length and homeostasis in human cells may be regulated by telomerase enzyme processivity .
The environmental arylamine mutagens are implicated in the etiology of various sporadic human cancers . Arylamine-modified dG lesions were studied in two fully paired 11-mer duplexes with a -G*CN- sequence context , in which G* is a C8-substituted dG adduct derived from fluorinated analogs of 4-aminobiphenyl ( FABP ) , 2-aminofluorene ( FAF ) or 2-acetylaminofluorene ( FAAF ) , and N is either dA or dT . The FABP and FAF lesions exist in a simple mixture of ' stacked ' ( S ) and ' B-type ' ( B ) conformers , whereas the N-acetylated FAAF also samples a ' wedge ' ( W ) conformer . FAAF is repaired three to four times more efficiently than FABP and FAF . A simple A- to -T polarity swap in the G*CA/G*CT transition produced a dramatic increase in syn-conformation and resulted in 2- to 3-fold lower nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) efficiencies in Escherichia coli . These results indicate that lesion-induced DNA bending/thermodynamic destabilization is an important DNA damage recognition factor , more so than the local S/B-conformational heterogeneity that was observed previously for FAF and FAAF in certain sequence contexts . This work represents a novel 3'-next flanking sequence effect as a unique NER factor for bulky arylamine lesions in E. coli .
Identifying prognostic factors for osteosarcoma ( OS ) aids in the selection of patients who require more aggressive management . CD133 has been found to be a prognostic factor of certain tumor types . However , the association between CD133 expression and the prognosis of OS remains unknown . In this study , we analyzed the association of CD133 expression in OS with clinical factors and overall survival , and further investigated its potential role in metastasis in vitro . We found CD133 expression in 65.7% ( 46/70 ) of OS samples using immunohistochemistry , and it was positively correlated with lung metastasis analyzed by Chi-square test ( P=0.002 ) and shorter overall survival time using the Kaplan-Meier method compared by log-rank test ( P=0.000 ) . Multivariate analysis showed that CD133 expression was an independent prognostic factor of patients with OS . To test for direct participation of CD133 , we separated CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells in the MG63 cell line using magnetic-activated cell sorting and found that CD133(+) cells were more active in migration by scratch wound-healing assay and invasion by Matrigel invasion assay compared with CD133(-) cells . Elevated mRNA expression of the stemness gene octamer-binding transcription factor 4 ( Oct-4 ) and NANOG , and the metastasis-related receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 ( CXCR4 ) were also found in CD133(+) cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction . Thus , expression of CD133 was correlated with lung metastasis and poor prognosis in OS patients . CD133(+) cells may be a type of cancer stem cell with high expression of self-renewal capacity and metastasis-related genes .
That a knock-in mouse harboring a dominant-negative thyroid hormone receptor ( TR)-beta ( Thrb ) mutation develops metastatic thyroid cancer strongly suggests the involvement of TRbeta in carcinogenesis . Epigenetic silencing of the THRB gene is common in human cancers . The aim of the present study was to determine how DNA methylation affected the expression of the THRB gene in differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) and how reexpression of the THRB gene attenuated the cancer phenotypes . We used methylation-specific PCR to examine the expression and promoter methylation of the THRB gene in DTC tissues . Thyroid cancer cells with hypermethylated THRB were treated with the demethylating agents 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5'-aza-CdR ) and zebularine to evaluate their impact on the cancer cell phenotypes . THRB mRNA expression in DTC was 90% lower than in normal controls , and this decrease was associated with a higher tumor/lymph node staging . The promoter methylation level of the THRB gene had a significant negative correlation with the expression level of the THRB gene . Treatment of FTC-236 cells with 5'-aza-CdR or zebularine induced reexpression of the THRB gene and inhibited cell proliferation and migration . FTC-236 cells stably expressing TRbeta exhibited lower cell proliferation and migration through inhibition of beta-catenin signaling pathways compared with FTC-236 without TRbeta. 5'-Aza-CdR also led to suppression of tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model using FTC-236 cells consistent with the cell-based studies . These finding indicate that TRbeta is a tumor suppressor and could be tested as a potential therapeutic target .
This study aimed to analyze the role of endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC)-derived angiogenic factors and chemokines in the multistep process driving angiogenesis with a focus on the recently discovered macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF)/chemokine receptor axis . Primary murine and murine embryonic EPCs ( eEPCs ) were analyzed for the expression of angiogenic/chemokines and components of the MIF/CXC chemokine receptor axis , focusing on the influence of hypoxic versus normoxic stimulation . Hypoxia induced an upregulation of CXCR2 and CXCR4 but not CD74 on EPCs and triggered the secretion of CXCL12 , CXCL1 , MIF , and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . These factors stimulated the transmigration activity and adhesive capacity of EPCs , with MIF and VEGF exhibiting the strongest effects under hypoxia . MIF- , VEGF- , CXCL12- , and CXCL1-stimulated EPCs enhanced tube formation , with MIF and VEGF exhibiting again the strongest effect following hypoxia . Tube formation following in vivo implantation utilizing angiogenic factor-loaded Matrigel plugs was only promoted by VEGF . Coloading of plugs with eEPCs led to enhanced tube formation only by CXCL12 , whereas MIF was the only factor which induced differentiation towards an endothelial and smooth muscle cell ( SMC ) phenotype , indicating an angiogenic and differentiation capacity in vivo . Surprisingly , CXCL12 , a chemoattractant for smooth muscle progenitor cells , inhibited SMC differentiation . We have identified a role for EPC-derived proangiogenic MIF , VEGF and MIF receptors in EPC recruitment following hypoxia , EPC differentiation and subsequent tube and vessel formation , whereas CXCL12 , a mediator of early EPC recruitment , does not contribute to the remodeling process . By discerning the contributions of key angiogenic chemokines and EPCs , these findings offer valuable mechanistic insight into mouse models of angiogenesis and help to define the intricate interplay between EPC-derived angiogenic cargo factors , EPCs , and the angiogenic target tissue .
There are contradictory observations about the different radiosensitivities of cancer stem cells and cancer non-stem cells . To resolve these contradictory observations , we studied radiosensitivities by employing breast cancer stem cell ( CSC)-like MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB453 cells as well as their corresponding non-stem cells . CSC-like cells proliferate without differentiating and have characteristics of tumor-initiating cells [ 1 ] . These cells were exposed to \u03b3-rays ( 1.25-8.75 Gy ) and survival curves were determined by colony formation . A final slope , D(0) , of the survival curve for each cell line was determined to measure radiosensitivity . The D(0) of CSC-like and non-stem MDA-MB-453 cells were 1.16 Gy and 1.55 Gy , respectively . Similar results were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells ( 0.94 Gy vs. 1.56 Gy ) . After determination of radiosensitivity , we investigated intrinsic cellular determinants which influence radiosensitivity including cell cycle distribution , free-radical scavengers and DNA repair . We observed that even though cell cycle status and antioxidant content may contribute to differential radiosensitivity , differential DNA repair capacity may be a greater determinant of radiosensitivity . Unlike non-stem cells , CSC-like cells have little/no sublethal damage repair , a low intracellular level of ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) and delay of \u03b3-H2AX foci removal ( DNA strand break repair ) . These results suggest that low DNA repair capacity is responsible for the high radiosensitivity of these CSC-like cells .
We have already shown that IL-10 plays an important role in immunosuppression and metastatic dissemination in the rat B-cell lymphoma L-TACB model . It was suggested that the up-regulation of IL-10 production and IL-10 receptor ( IL-10R ) expression would be part of the transition from primary tumor to metastatic phenotype and that IL-10 , besides its immunosuppressive activity , may act as a growth factor for metastatic L-TACB cells . The treatment of L-TACB-bearing rats with a single low-dose cyclophosphamide decreased IL-10 production , reverted immunosuppression and induced the immunologic rejection of tumor metastasis without any effect on primary tumor growth . Our current aim was to investigate the effects of cyclophosphamide on the expression of IL-10 and IL-10R on primary and metastatic L-TACB cells . Considering that cyclophosphamide is a prodrug , we used mafosfamide , a compound that yields in vitro the same active metabolites as cyclophosphamide does in vivo . Mafosfamide induced down-regulation of IL-10 production and IL-10R expression on metastatic cells and , concomitantly , inhibited metastatic cell proliferation . We suggest that mafosfamide would inhibit the regulatory loop mediated by the IL-10/IL-10R system and , as a consequence , metastatic cell proliferation . These results may have a considerable impact on the design of new therapies for metastatic lymphomas .
When the cell cycle is arrested , even though growth-promoting pathways such as mTOR are still active , then cells senesce . For example , induction of either p21 or p16 arrests the cell cycle without inhibiting mTOR , which , in turn , converts p21/p16-induced arrest into senescence ( geroconversion ) . Here we show that geroconversion is accompanied by dramatic accumulation of cyclin D1 followed by cyclin E and replicative stress . When p21 was switched off , senescent cells ( despite their loss of proliferative potential ) progressed through S phase , and levels of cyclins D1 and E dropped . Most cells entered mitosis and then died , either during mitotic arrest or after mitotic slippage , or underwent endoreduplication . Next , we investigated whether inhibition of mTOR would prevent accumulation of cyclins and loss of mitotic competence in p21-arrested cells . Both nutlin-3 , which inhibits mTOR in these cells , and rapamycin suppressed geroconversion during p21-induced arrest , decelerated accumulation of cyclins D1 and E and decreased replicative stress . When p21 was switched off , cells successfully progressed through both S phase and mitosis . Also , senescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) overexpressed cyclin D1 . After release from cell cycle arrest , senescent MEFs entered S phase but could not undergo mitosis and did not proliferate . We conclude that cellular senescence is characterized by futile hyper-mitogenic drive associated with mTOR-dependent mitotic incompetence .
Approximately 50% of melanomas require oncogenic B-RAF(V600E) signaling for proliferation , survival , and metastasis , and the use of highly selective B-RAF inhibitors has yielded remarkable , although short-term , clinical responses . Reactivation of signaling downstream of B-RAF is frequently associated with acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibitors , and the identification of B-RAF targets may therefore provide new strategies for managing melanoma . In this report , we applied whole-genome expression analyses to reveal that oncogenic B-RAF(V600E) regulates genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in normal cutaneous human melanocytes . Most prominent was the B-RAF-mediated transcriptional repression of E-cadherin , a keratinocyte-melanoma adhesion molecule whose loss is intimately associated with melanoma invasion and metastasis . Here we identify a link between oncogenic B-RAF , the transcriptional repressor Tbx3 , and E-cadherin . We show that B-RAF(V600E) induces the expression of Tbx3 , which potently represses E-cadherin expression in melanocytes and melanoma cells . Tbx3 expression is normally restricted to developmental embryonic tissues and promoting cell motility , but it is also aberrantly increased in various cancers and has been linked to tumor cell invasion and metastasis . We propose that this B-RAF/Tbx3/E-cadherin pathway has a critical role in promoting the metastasis of B-RAF-mutant melanomas .
Bisphenol A is a monomer used in the production of polycarbonate plastics , epoxy resins , and flame retardants . It is an endocrine disruptor with a variety of other effects , including genotoxicity . Oxidative metabolism of bisphenol A yields electophilic bisphenol A-3,4-quinone ( BPAQ ) , which may cause genotoxicity . To determine the genotoxic potential of bisphenol A , the mechanism of the reaction between the BPAQ and deoxyadenosine ( dA ) was studied in detail . The most probable reaction pathway was determined using quantum chemical methods . Our results demonstrate that the rate limiting step is Michael addition between BPAQ and dA , the main product being the unstable N7-modified adduct that rapidly undergoes depurination . In addition , our calculations provide strong evidence for protonation of the adducts prior to depurination , which indicates pH dependence of the reaction . The calculated activation barrier for Michael addition is 28.7 kcal/mol , indicating that the reaction with dA is very slow . Comparison with the activation energy of 23.1 kcal/mol for the corresponding deoxyguanosine reaction indicates that most of the DNA damage by BPAQ will occur at the guanine site . The detoxification reactions with glutathione compete with reactions between BPAQ and DNA . The calculated free energy of activation for the reaction with glutathione is significantly lower than that for the corresponding reaction with dA . This indicates that BPAQ will preferably react with glutathione and will only react with DNA when the level of glutathione in the cell is low .
Von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) is a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the production of angiogenic factors . Mutations in the VHL gene cause VHL syndrome , which is characterized by highly vascularized tumors . Here we report a c.464T>A mutation of the VHL gene in three patients with hemangioblastoma from a Chinese family . This mutation was not reported previously and was absent in the unaffected family members . The mutation is predicted to cause Val to Glu substitution at VHL protein residue 155 in a conserved region . Previous biochemical studies demonstrated that residue Val-155 was critical for VHL protein binding to chaperonin TRiC/CCT , an essential step for proper VHL protein folding . Our finding of naturally occurring VHL V155E mutation in patients with VHL syndrome supports the functional importance of Val-155 residue in VHL protein and illustrates the diversity of VHL gene defects underlying VHL syndrome .
AIM To investigate the role of delta-like ligand 4 ( DLL4 ) in the angiogenesis of high-grade malignant glioma . MATERIALS AND METHODS DLL4 expression and microvessel density ( MVD ) were detected by immunohistochemistry in 51 human high-grade malignant glioma tissue samples . The vessel maturation index ( VMI ) was calculated as the percentage of a-smooth muscle actin ( a-SMA)-positive vessels in relation to the amount of CD31-positive vessels . Double fluorescent immunostaining for CD31 and EphrinB2 or EphB4 was performed to identify the arterial ( EphrinB2 ) or venous ( EphB4 ) origins of glioma microvessels . RESULTS Strong immunostaining of DLL4 and a positive correlation of DLL4 with the MVD were observed in high-grade malignant gliomas . The VMI of the DLL4-positive group was significantly higher than that of the DLL4-negative group . However , no significant association was found between DLL4 and EphrinB2 or EphB4 in high-grade gliomas . CONCLUSION DLL4 may be an important regulator for vessel proliferation and maturation in human high-grade malignant gliomas .
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are 19 nt non-coding RNA molecules that regulate expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level . Evidence indicates that miRNAs play an essential role in physiological and pathological conditions including pulmonary development , inflammation , fibrosis and cancer . The aim of the present study is to investigate the altered miRNAs expression profile in rats with experimental silicosis . We duplicated silicosis rat model , and identify the miRNA expression pattern of silicosis rat with miRNA microarray . Compared with normal lung tissue , fourteen miRNAs were found significantly up-regulated while the other twenty-five down-regulated in silicosis samples . The differential expression of two selected miRNAs was confirmed by stem-loop real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction . Our results indicate that the 39 altered miRNAs may be involved in lung fibrosis of rats that were exposed to silica dust . Furthermore , the microarray results provide a solid basis for further validation , such as identification of other miRNAs that may be related to inflammation and fibrosis . The findings are paving way for silicosis early prevention , prognosis and possible therapy .
Excessive exposure to solar UVA and UVB radiation is widely considered to cause skin cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma and basalioma . Direct UVB damage to skin cell DNA as well as UV-induced chronic skin inflammation , accelerated keratinocyte proliferation , inhibited apoptosis , and immunosuppression seem to underlie the UV-induced carcinogenesis . Also , UVB induces cytochrome P450 subfamilies ( CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 ) involved in metabolic activation of organic pro-carcinogens and their conversion to ultimate carcinogens . Here , the effects of several glycosylated and non-glycosylated plant polyphenols ( verbascoside , resveratrol , polydatin , rutin , and quercetin ) on the inflammatory , apoptotic , metabolic , and proliferative responses of cultured human epidermal keratinocytes ( HEK ) to non-cytotoxic doses of solar-simulated UVA+UVB and chemical mediators of UV signalling in HEK , 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole and squalene isolated from photo-oxidized skin surface lipids ( SSL ) , were evaluated . We showed that the stilbenes and quercetin being exposed to UV were photo-destroyed within a short period of time , while verbascoside and rutin were photo-stable . When SSL were exposed to UV , the stilbenes and quercetin remarkably accelerated photo-oxidation of alpha-tocopherol , squalene , and cholesterol fractions , whilst verbascoside protected them . Verbascoside invariably inhibited molecular pathways in HEK leading to inflammatory cytokine expression ( NFkappaB and EGFR/ERK phosphorylation ) , and cell proliferation ( EGFR nuclear translocation ) , and displayed a stimulus-specific effect on the metabolic axis aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR)-CYP1A1/CYP1B1 . By contrast , the stilbenes inhibited UV-connected inflammatory cytokines excluding IL-8 , but they prevalently stimulated NFkappaB , EGFR nuclear translocation and the AhR-CYP pathway . We conclude that , among the PPs investigated , verbascoside does interfere with multiple UV-sensitive signalling in HEK in a way that it could have a major impact on skin cancer chemoprevention .
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are considered to be regulators of various biological processes in cancers , including the epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , which is a key factor in cancer metastasis . In this study , we aimed to clarify the potential roles of miR-490-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells . Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR , we discovered that miR-490-3p was up-regulated in HCC tissues and cells compared with the adjacent non-tumor tissues and normal cells . We also found that overexpression of miR-490-3p led to an increase in cell proliferation , migration , and invasion abilities and that it contributed to EMT . The inhibition of miR-490-3p had the opposite effect on the cells . We identified ERGIC3 ( endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment protein 3 ) as a direct target gene for miR-490-3p . Unlike most miRNA-mRNA interactions , miR-490-3p increased ERGIC3 mRNA and protein levels as well as the intensity of expression of the EGFP reporter gene controlled by the 3'-UTR of ERGIC3 mRNA . The up-regulation by miR-490-3p also required the participation of Ago2 . The inhibition of miR-490-3p reduced the expression of ERGIC3 . Overexpression of ERGIC3 led to the same effect on HCC cells as miR-490-3p overexpression , including EMT . Importantly , silencing ERGIC3 reversed the cellular responses mediated by miR-490-3p overexpression . In conclusion , our study indicated for the first time that miR-490-3p functioned like an oncogenic miRNA in HCC cells and that the inhibition of miR-490-3p might provide an potential treatment approach for HCC patients .
Group VIB Phospholipase A(2) ( iPLA(2)gamma ) is distributed in membranous organelles in which beta-oxidation occurs , that is , mitochondria and peroxisomes , and is expressed by insulin-secreting pancreatic islet beta-cells and INS-1 insulinoma cells , which can be injured by inflammatory cytokines , for example , IL-1beta and IFN-gamma , and by oxidants , for example , streptozotocin ( STZ ) or t-butyl-hydroperoxide ( TBHP ) , via processes pertinent to mechanisms of beta-cell loss in types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus . We find that incubating INS-1 cells with IL-1beta and IFN-gamma , with STZ , or with TBHP causes increased expression of iPLA(2)gamma mRNA and protein . We prepared INS-1 knockdown ( KD ) cell lines with reduced iPLA(2)gamma expression , and they proliferate more slowly than control INS-1 cells and undergo increased membrane peroxidation in response to cytokines or oxidants . Accumulation of oxidized phospholipid molecular species in STZ-treated INS-1 cells was demonstrated by LC/MS/MS scanning , and the levels in iPLA(2)gamma-KD cells exceeded those in control cells. iPLA(2)gamma-KD INS-1 cells also exhibited higher levels of apoptosis than control cells when incubated with STZ or with IL-1beta and IFN-gamma . These findings suggest that iPLA(2)gamma promotes beta-cell proliferation and that its expression is increased during inflammation or oxidative stress as a mechanism to mitigate membrane injury that may enhance beta-cell survival .
Reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a key eventduring tumorigenesis . Despite being known for decades ( Warburg effect ) , the molecular mechanisms regulating this switch remained unexplored . Here , we identify SIRT6 as a tumor suppressor thatregulates aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells . Importantly , loss of SIRT6 leads to tumor formation without activation of known oncogenes , whereas transformed SIRT6-deficient cells display increased glycolysis and tumor growth , suggesting that SIRT6 plays a role in both establishment and maintenance of cancer . By using a conditional SIRT6 allele , we show that SIRT6 deletion invivo increases the number , size , and aggressiveness of tumors . SIRT6 also functions as a regulator of ribosome metabolismby corepressing MYC transcriptional activity . Lastly,Sirt6 is selectively downregulated in several human cancers , and expression levels of SIRT6 predict prognosis and tumor-free survival rates , highlighting SIRT6 as a critical modulator of cancermetabolism . Our studies reveal SIRT6 to be a potent tumor suppressor acting to suppress cancer metabolism .
The EGF-stimulated ERK/MAPK pathway is a key conduit for cellular proliferation signals and a therapeutic target in many cancers . Here , we characterize two central quantitative aspects of this pathway : the mechanism by which signal strength is encoded and the response curve relating signal output to proliferation . Under steady-state conditions , we find that ERK is activated in discrete , asynchronous pulses with frequency and duration determined by extracellular concentrations of EGF spanning the physiological range . In genetically identical sister cells , cell-to-cell variability in pulse dynamics influences the decision to enter S phase . While targeted inhibition of EGFR reduces the frequency of ERK activity pulses , inhibition of MEK reduces their amplitude . Continuous response curves measured in multiple cell lines reveal that proliferation is effectively silenced only when ERK pathway output falls below a threshold of indicating that high-dose targeting of the pathway is necessary to achieve therapeutic efficacy .
The mechanisms by which hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSC and HPC ) from myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) undergo ineffective production of blood cells and disease transformation into acute myeloid leukemia remain to be investigated . It has been confirmed that increased production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) under various pathological conditions impairs HSC self-renewal and causes HSC premature exhaustion and BM suppression primarily via induction of HSC senescence , and oncogene induces accumulation of ROS and DNA damage and subsequently cellular senescence , which functions as an important barrier to prevent the growth of transformed cells to form a neoplasia . Here we investigated whether MDS CD34(+) cells enriched with HSC and HPC undergo senescence through accumulation of ROS and DNA damage and their action mechanisms . In this study , the percentages of SA-beta-gal positive senescent CD34(+) cells increased in lower-risk MDS patients , but not in higher-risk MDS and AML patients , compared to that of healthy controls . The increases were associated with an elevated expression of p21 but not the activation of p38 . Further study found that there were increased ROS and DNA damage in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells enriched with HSC progression from lower-risk MDS , higher-risk MDS to AML . Therefore , these data suggest that CD34(+) cells from patients with lower-risk MDS present p21 dependent premature senescence , increased accumulation of ROS and DNA damage in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells could contribute to this process ; however , CD34(+) cells from patients with higher-risk MDS could develop some mechanisms to uncouple ROS and DNA damage induced senescence .
The flow of interstitial fluid and the associated interstitial fluid pressure ( IFP ) in solid tumors and surrounding host tissues have been identified as critical elements in cancer growth and vascularization . Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that tumors may present elevated IFP , which can be a formidable physical barrier for delivery of cell nutrients and small molecules into the tumor . Elevated IFP may also exacerbate gradients of biochemical signals such as angiogenic factors released by tumors into the surrounding tissues . These studies have helped to understand both biochemical signaling and treatment prognosis . Building upon previous work , here we develop a vascular tumor growth model by coupling a continuous growth model with a discrete angiogenesis model . We include fluid/oxygen extravasation as well as a continuous lymphatic field , and study the micro-environmental fluid dynamics and their effect on tumor growth by accounting for blood flow , transcapillary fluid flux , interstitial fluid flow , and lymphatic drainage . We thus elucidate further the non-trivial relationship between the key elements contributing to the effects of interstitial pressure in solid tumors . In particular , we study the effect of IFP on oxygen extravasation and show that small blood/lymphatic vessel resistance and collapse may contribute to lower transcapillary fluid/oxygen flux , thus decreasing the rate of tumor growth . We also investigate the effect of tumor vascular pathologies , including elevated vascular and interstitial hydraulic conductivities inside the tumor as well as diminished osmotic pressure differences , on the fluid flow across the tumor capillary bed , the lymphatic drainage , and the IFP . Our results reveal that elevated interstitial hydraulic conductivity together with poor lymphatic function is the root cause of the development of plateau profiles of the IFP in the tumor , which have been observed in experiments , and contributes to a more uniform distribution of oxygen , solid tumor pressure and a broad-based collapse of the tumor lymphatics . We also find that the rate that IFF is fluxed into the lymphatics and host tissue is largely controlled by an elevated vascular hydraulic conductivity in the tumor . We discuss the implications of these results on microenvironmental transport barriers , and the tumor invasive and metastatic potential . Our results suggest the possibility of developing strategies of targeting tumor cells based on the cues in the interstitial fluid .
Methyleugenol ( MEG ) , a constituent of plants used in the human diet , is hepatocarcinogenic in rodents . In an experiment to elucidate its mode of action in rat liver , male F344 rats were administered MEG intragastrically at 3 doses per week for up to 16 weeks in an initiation phase , after which half the rats were fed 500 ppm phenobarbital ( PB ) in the diet to promote liver neoplasia and the other half were maintained on control diet for 24 weeks . At 8 and 16 week interim terminations , ( 32)P-nucleotide postlabeling assay revealed 3 adducts in livers of all MEG groups . The hepatocellular replicating fractions , measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry , were doubled or more in all MEG groups . Hepatocellular altered foci , detected by glutathione S-transferase-placental type ( \u03c0 ) immunohistochemistry , were present beginning with the high dose group at 8 weeks and extending to all MEG groups at 16 weeks . At the end of maintenance/promotion phase , the incidences , multiplicity and size of foci was similar between control and low dose groups , while those of mid and high dose groups were increased . Hepatocellular adenomas occurred in the mid and high dose groups , attaining higher multiplicity and size with PB . Thus , MEG had rapid initiating activity , reflecting the formation of DNA adducts and possibly cell proliferation .
The potential of cytologically reconstructed barley line D-2946 to cope with the major lesions that hamper genome integrity , namely DNA single- and double-strand breaks was investigated . Strand breaks induced by \u03b3-rays and Li ions were assessed by neutral and alkaline comet assay . Repair capacity after bleomycin treatment was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis under neutral and alkaline conditions . Frequencies of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations were also determined . Results indicate that radiation-mediated constitutive rearrangement of the chromosome complement has led to a substantial modulation of the sensitivity of barley genome towards DNA strand breaks , produced by ionising radiation , Li ion implantation and bleomycin in an agent-specific manner , as well as of the clastogenic response to \u03b3-rays . Based on these findings , reconstructed barley karyotype D-2946 can be considered a candidate radio-sensitive line with reduced ability to maintain genome integrity with respect to both DNA and chromosomal damage .
Low-dose cyclophosphamide ( CP ) therapy induces immunogenic tumor cell death and decreases regulatory T cell ( Treg ) numbers in mice with transplantable tumors . Using the ret transgenic murine melanoma model that resembles human melanoma , we detected no beneficial antitumor effects with such treatment , despite a decrease in Tregs . On the contrary , low-dose CP enhanced the production of chronic inflammatory mediators in melanoma lesions associated with increased accumulation of Gr1(+)CD11b(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) , which exhibit elevated suppressive activity and nitric oxide ( NO ) production as well as inhibition of T-cell proliferation . Moreover , the frequencies of CD8(+) T cells in the tumors and their ability to produce perforin were decreased . To study whether the observed CP-induced MDSC expansion and activation also occurs under chronic inflammatory tumor-free conditions , mice exhibiting chronic inflammation were treated with CP . Similar to tumor-bearing mice , CP-treated inflamed mice displayed elevated levels of MDSCs with enhanced production of NO , reactive oxygen species , and a suppressed in vivo natural killer ( NK ) cell cytotoxic activity indicating CP effects on the host immune system independent of the tumor . We suggest that melanoma therapy with low-dose CP could be efficient only when combined with the neutralization of MDSC immunosuppressive function and chronic inflammatory microenvironment.Journal of Investigative Dermatology advance online publication , 6 December 2012 ; doi:10.1038/jid.2012.444 .
BACKGROUND Young age is a favorable prognostic factor for patients with glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . We reviewed the outcomes and molecular tumor characteristics of adolescent and young adult patients with GBM treated in 2 Austrian centers . PATIENTS AND METHODS Data on patients with histologically proven primary GBM diagnosed from 18 through 40 years of age were retrospectively analyzed . All patients were treated with standard first-line therapy . The primary end points were overall survival ( OS ) and time to progression ( TTP ) . IDH1-R132H mutation status was analyzed using immunohistochemistry , and MGMT promoter methylation was assessed using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction . RESULTS We included 70 patients ( 36 men and 34 women ) with a median age of 33 years . IDH1-R132H mutations were detected in 22 ( 39.3% ) of 56 cases and MGMT promoter methylation in 33 ( 61.1% ) of 54 cases with available tissue samples . In patients with wild-type IDH , median TTP was 8.2 months and median OS was 24 months , compared with 18 months and 44 months , respectively , observed in patients with mutated IDH . Neither IDH1 nor MGMT status showed a statistically significant association with TTP or OS . Of note , the social and economical situation of the young patients with GBM was alarming , because only 17% succeeded in staying employed after receiving the diagnosis . CONCLUSIONS We found a high frequency of IDH1 mutations and MGMT promoter methylation among young adult patients with primary GBM that may contribute to the generally favorable outcome associated with young age . The social and economic coverage of patients with glioma remains an unsolved socio-ethical problem .
Osteosarcoma is a high-grade malignant bone tumor that manifests ingravescent clinical behavior . The intrinsic events that confer malignant properties on osteosarcoma cells have remained unclear , however . We previously established two lines of mouse osteosarcoma cells : AX cells , which are able to form tumors in syngeneic mice , and AXT cells , which were derived from such tumors and acquired an increased tumorigenic capacity during tumor development . We have now identified Igf2 mRNA-binding protein3 ( Imp3 ) as a key molecule responsible for this increased tumorigenicity of AXT cells in vivo . Imp3 is consistently up-regulated in tumors formed by AX cells , and its expression in these cells was found to confer malignant properties such as anchorage-independent growth , loss of contact inhibition , and escape from anoikis in vitro . The expression level of Imp3 also appeared directly related to tumorigenic ability in vivo which is the critical determination for tumor-initiating cells . The effect of Imp3 on tumorigenicity of osteosarcoma cells did not appear to be mediated through Igf2-dependent mechanism . Our results implicate Imp3 as a key regulator of stem-like tumorigenic characteristics in osteosarcoma cells and as a potential therapeutic target for this malignancy .
Lymphocytes are a key component of the immune system and their differentiation and function are directly influenced by cancer . We examined peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) gene expression as a biomarker of illness and treatment effect using the Affymetrix Human Gene ST1 platform in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) who received combined treatment with IL-2 , interferon-?-2a and dendritic cell vaccine . We examined gene expression , cytokine levels in patient serum and lymphocyte subsets as determined by flow cytometry ( FCM ) . Pre-treatment PBLs from patients with mRCC exhibit a gene expression profile and serum cytokine profile consistent with inflammation and proliferation not found in healthy donors ( HD ) . PBL gene expression from patients with mRCC showed increased mRNA of genes involved with T-cell and T(REG)-cell activation pathways , which was also reflected in lymphocyte subset distribution . Overall , PBL gene expression post-treatment ( POST ) was not significantly different than pre-treatment ( PRE ) . Nevertheless , treatment related changes in gene expression ( post-treatment minus pre-treatment ) revealed an increased expression of T-cell and B-cell receptor signaling pathways in responding ( R ) patients compared to non-responding ( NR ) patients . In addition , we observed down-regulation of T(REG)-cell pathways post-treatment in R vs. NR patients . While exploratory in nature , this study supports the hypothesis that enhanced inflammatory cytotoxic pathways coupled with blunting of the regulatory pathways is necessary for effective anti-cancer activity associated with immune therapy . This type of analysis can potentially identify additional immune therapeutic targets in patients with mRCC .
In recent years , microfluidic systems have been used to study fundamental aspects of angiogenesis through the patterning of single-layered , linear or geometric vascular channels . In vivo , however , capillaries exist in complex , three-dimensional ( 3D ) networks , and angiogenic sprouting occurs with a degree of unpredictability in all x,y,z planes . The ability to generate capillary beds in vitro that can support thick , biological tissues remains a key challenge to the regeneration of vital organs . Here , we report the engineering of 3D capillary beds in an in vitro microfluidic platform that is comprised of a biocompatible collagen I gel supported by a mechanical framework of alginate beads . The engineered vessels have patent lumens , form robust mm capillary networks across the devices , and support the perfusion of 1 <FFFD>m fluorescent beads through them . In addition , the alginate beads offer a modular method to encapsulate and co-culture cells that either promote angiogenesis or require perfusion for cell viability in engineered tissue constructs . This laboratory-constructed vascular supply may be clinically significant for the engineering of capillary beds and higher order biological tissues in a scalable and modular manner .
Metastasis , commonly to the lung , is the major cause of mortality from testicular cancer . The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a novel nutrient mixture ( NM ) containing ascorbic acid , amino acids and green tea extract on the inhibition of melanoma growth and metastasis using a model of intratesticular inoculation of B16FO cells into nude mice . Male athymic mice ( n=12 ) , 10-12 weeks of age , were inoculated with 5<FFFD>10(5) B16FO melanoma cells in 100 mul of PBS into the right testis , while the left testis was left untreated . Following inoculation , the mice were randomly divided into two groups . The control group ( n=6 ) was fed a regular mouse chow diet and the NM 1% group ( n=6 ) the same diet , but supplemented with 1% NM . Four weeks later the mice were sacrificed and the abdominal cavity was opened . Mice in the control group exhibited extensive metastasis in the peritoneal cavity and severely enlarged right testes and necrotic seminiferous tubules . By contrast , in the NM 1% fed group there was no evidence of peritoneal metastasis in 50% of the animals and mild metastasis in the remaining 50% . The right testes were enlarged and seminiferous tubules in the area of invasion showed evidence of degeneration . No metastasis to the liver , kidney or spleen were evident in either group . However , severe lung metastasis was observed in 2 of 6 mice in the control group and mild metastasis in 2 of 6 mice in the NM 1% group . In conclusion , these results confirm earlier studies and verify the anti-metastatic potential of NM .
The endothelial cell-specific microRNA ( miRNA ) , miR-126 , is considered a master regulator of physiological angiogenesis . Transplanted mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) release soluble factors contributing to neoangiogenesis and cardiac repair . Therefore , we hypothesized that the over-expression of miR-126 may prolong MSC survival and enhance the cell secretome , thereby improving post-infarction angiogenesis and cardiac function . In this study , MSCs harvested from male C57BL/6 mouse bone marrow were infected in vitro with miR-126 ( MSC(miR-126) ) by using recombinant lentiviral vectors ; the control cells were either non-transfected or transduced with mock vectors ( MSC(null) ) . The results showed an increased secretion of angiogenic factors and a higher resistance against hypoxia in MSC(miR-126) compared with the control cells . The expression of the Notch ligand Delta-like ( Dll)-4 in the MSC(miR-126) group was also increased . For in vivo experiments , MSC(miR-126) cultures were intramyocardially injected into the infarct region of the hearts of female C57BL/6 mice ( an acute myocardial infarction model ) who had undergone ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery . The survival of MSC(miR-126) cultures , determined by Sry expression , was increased at 7 days after transplantation . MSC(miR-126)-treated animals showed significantly improved cardiac function as assessed by echocardiography 2 weeks later . The expression levels of angiogenic factors and Dll-4 in the infarcted myocardium were further increased by MSC(miR-126) compared with MSCs or MSC(null) cultures . Furthermore , fluorescent microsphere and histological studies revealed that myocardial blood flow and microvessel density were significantly increased in the MSC(miR-126)-transplanted animals . In addition , we found increased immature vessel proliferation following the transplantation of MSC(miR-126) cultures in which the expression of Dll-4 had been knocked down . However , blood vessels with lumen were barely detected , which indicated that Dll-4 plays a key role in tubulogenesis . We conclude that the transplantation of MSCs overexpressing miR-126 can further enhance functional angiogenesis in the ischemic myocardium possibly by the secretion of angiogenic factors and the activation of Dll-4 , thus increasing MSC survival . Therefore , MSCs modified with miR-126 may represent a novel and efficient therapeutic approach for ischemic angiogenesis and the improvement of cardiac function .
The tumor suppressors Lats1 and Lats2 are mediators of the Hippo pathway that regulates tissue growth and proliferation . Their N-terminal non-kinase regions are distinct except for Lats conserved domains 1 and 2 ( LCD1 and LCD2 ) , which may be important for Lats1/2-specific functions . Lats1 knockout mice were generated by disrupting the N-terminal region containing LCD1 ( Lats1(\u0394N/\u0394N) ) . Some Lats1(\u0394N/\u0394N) mice were born safely and grew normally . However , mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) from Lats1(\u0394N/\u0394N) mice displayed mitotic defects , centrosomal overduplication , chromosomal misalignment , multipolar spindle formation , chromosomal bridging and cytokinesis failure . They also showed anchorage-independent growth and continued cell cycles and cell growth , bypassing cell-cell contact inhibition similar to tumor cells . Lats1(\u0394N/\u0394N) MEFs produced tumors in nude mice after subcutaneous injection , although the tumor growth rate was much slower than that of ordinary cancer cells . Yap , a key transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo pathway , was overexpressed and stably retained in Lats1(\u0394N/\u0394N) MEFs in a cell density independent manner , and Lats2 mRNA expression was downregulated . In conclusion , N-terminally truncated Lats1 induced Lats2 downregulation and Yap protein accumulation , leading to chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis .
UNLABELLED ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND Tamoxifen is used in hormone therapy for estrogen-receptor ( ER)-positive breast cancer , but also has chemopreventative effects against ER-negative breast cancers . This study sought to investigate whether oral iron-saturated bovine lactoferrin ( Fe-Lf ) , a natural product which enhances chemotherapy , could improve the chemotherapeutic effects of tamoxifen in the treatment of ER-negative breast cancers . METHODS In a model of breast cancer prevention , female Balb/c mice treated with tamoxifen ( 5 mg/Kg ) were fed an Fe-Lf supplemented diet ( 5 g/Kg diet ) or the base diet . At week 2 , 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells were injected into an inguinal mammary fat pad . In a model of breast cancer treatment , tamoxifen treatment was not started until two weeks following tumor cell injection . Tumor growth , metastasis , body weight , and levels of interleukin 18 ( IL-18 ) and interferon gamma ( IFN-gamma ) were analyzed . RESULTS Tamoxifen weakly ( IC50 inhibited the proliferation of 4T1 cells at pharmacological concentrations in vitro . In the tumor prevention study , a Fe-Lf diet in combination with tamoxifen caused a 4 day delay in tumor formation , and significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis to the liver and lung by 48 , 58 , and 66% ( all P < 0.001 ) , respectively , compared to untreated controls . The combination therapy was significantly ( all P < 0.05 ) more effective than the respective monotherapies . Oral Fe-Lf attenuated the loss of body weight caused by tamoxifen and cancer cachexia . It prevented tamoxifen-induced reductions in serum levels of IL-18 and IFN-gamma , and intestinal cells expressing IL-18 and IFN-gamma . It increased the levels of Lf in leukocytes residing in gut-associated lymphoid tissues . B , T and Natural killer ( NK ) cells containing high levels of Lf were identified in 4T1 tumors , suggesting they had migrated from the intestine . Similar effects of Fe-Lf and tamoxifen on tumor cell viability were seen in the treatment of established tumors . CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that Fe-Lf is a potent natural adjuvant capable of augmenting the chemotherapeutic activity of tamoxifen . It could have application in delaying relapse in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients who are at risk of developing ER-negative tumors .
Bigelovin is a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from the plant Inula helianthus-aquatica which was traditionally used in cancer treatment in Yunnan , China . The potent apoptotic activities of bigelovin in human leukemia U937 cells were shown in our previous study . The present study investigated the anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory effects of bigelovin using transgenic zebrafish Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 with fluorescent blood vessels and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) , respectively . Furthermore , the inhibitory activities of bigelovin on the human endothelial cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) were also examined . Our results showed that the growth of subintestinal vessels of the bigelovin-treated zebrafish embryos was significantly inhibited and the gene expressions in angiogenesis signaling pathways ( e.g . Ang2 and Tie2 ) of the zebrafish were down-regulated after bigelovin treatment . Besides , the proliferation and Th1 cytokines productions ( e.g . IFN-gamma , IL-2 and IL-12 ) were suppressed in bigelovin-treated PBMCs . On the other hand , bigelovin was shown to significantly inhibit the human monocyte adhesion to human endothelial cells and the gene expressions of inflammation-related CAMs ( e.g . ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 and E-selectin ) were significantly down-regulated in bigelovin-treated human endothelial cells . In summary , our data provide the first evidence that bigelovin possesses anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory activities , suggesting bigelovin may exert multi-target functions against cancer in animal models .
Adipose tissue growth and development are thought to be associated with angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling . Because ginseng has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activity , we hypothesized that adipose tissue growth and obesity can be regulated by Korean ginseng ( Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer ) . Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were fed for 8 weeks with a low fat diet , a high fat diet ( HFD ) , or HFD supplemented with 0.5% or 5% Korean red ginseng extract . We measured body weight , adipose tissue mass , food intake , MMP activity , and the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and MMPs . Administering ginseng to HFD-induced obese mice produced reductions in body weight and adipose tissue mass compared with untreated counterparts . Ginseng treatment decreased blood vessel density and MMP activity in adipose tissues . Ginseng also reduced mRNA levels of angiogenic factors ( e.g. , VEGF-A and FGF-2 ) and MMPs ( e.g. , MMP-2 and MMP-9 ) , whereas it increased mRNA levels of angiogenic inhibitors ( e.g. , TSP-1 , TIMP-1 , and TIMP-2 ) in adipose tissues . These results demonstrate that ginseng effectively reduces adipose tissue mass and prevents obesity in diet-induced obese mice and that this process may be mediated in part through the anti-angiogenic actions of ginseng .
It is well known that ErbB2 , a receptor tyrosine kinase , localizes to the plasma membrane . Here we describe a novel observation that ErbB2 also localizes in mitochondria of cancer cells and patient samples . We found that ErbB2 translocates into mitochondria through association with mtHSP70 . Additionally , mitochondrial ErbB2 ( mtErbB2 ) negatively regulates mitochondrial respiratory functions . Oxygen consumption and activities of complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain were decreased in mtErbB2-overexpressing cells . Mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP levels were also decreased . In contrast , mtErbB2 enhanced cellular glycolysis . The translocation of ErbB2 and its impact on mitochondrial function are kinase dependent . Interestingly , cancer cells with higher levels of mtErbB2 were more resistant to the ErbB2-targeting antibody trastuzumab . Our study provides a novel perspective on the metabolic regulatory function of ErbB2 and reveals that mtErbB2 has an important role in the regulation of cellular metabolism and cancer cell resistance to therapeutics .
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) is one of the most aggressive human neoplasms with extremely poor prognosis and a low survival rate . Immunosuppressive cell populations , e.g. regulatory T cells ( Treg ) , appear to be important in PDAC , contributing to patient's poor prognosis . Therefore , we investigated the PDAC microenvironment with a focus on conventional and regulatory T cells in view of their potential therapeutic importance . We found that tumors from the murine Panc02 orthotopic model of PDAC were infiltrated with high numbers of Treg . Remarkably , these cells exhibited the effector/memory phenotype , suggesting their enhanced suppressive activity and higher proliferation capacity . Although we observed a steady increase in transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) levels in the tumors , treatment with a specific inhibitor of TGF-beta receptor I kinase failed to abrogate Treg accumulation . A CCR4 antagonist did not affect Treg percentage in the tumor either . However , intense Treg cell division in the tumor microenvironment was demonstrated , suggesting local proliferation as a major mechanism of Treg accumulation in PDAC . Notably , this accumulation was reduced by low-dose gemcitabine administration , resulting in a modestly increased survival of PDAC mice . Our results provide an insight into mechanisms of immunosuppression in PDAC , suggesting an important role for proliferative expansion of effector/memory Treg . Low-dose gemcitabine therapy selectively depletes Treg , providing a basis for new modalities of PDAC therapy .
ABSTRACT : Cell size homeostasis is a conserved attribute in many eukaryotic species involving a tight regulation between the processes of growth and proliferation . In budding yeast S. cerevisiae , growth to a " critical cell size " must be achieved before a cell can progress past START and commit to cell division . Numerous studies have shown that progression past START is actively regulated by cell size control genes , many of which have implications in cell cycle control and cancer . Two initial screens identified genes that strongly modulate cell size in yeast . Since a second generation yeast gene knockout collection has been generated , we screened an additional 779 yeast knockouts containing 435 new ORFs ( of the yeast genome ) to supplement previous cell size screens . Upon completion , 10 new strong size mutants were identified : nine in log-phase cells and one in saturation-phase cells , and 97% of the yeast genome has now been screened for cell size mutations . The majority of the logarithmic phase size mutants have functions associated with translation further implicating the central role of growth control in the cell division process . Genetic analyses suggest ECM9 is directly associated with the START transition . Further , the small ( whi ) mutants mrpl49Delta and cbs1Delta are dependent on CLN3 for cell size effects . In depth analyses of new size mutants may facilitate a better understanding of the processes that govern cell size homeostasis .
Liver resection is now widely accepted as a potentially curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis . However , the efficacy of surgical resection for gastric cancer liver metastasis(GLM)remains unclear . Based on our 18-year experience with 64 patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for GLM , we discuss the indication and efficacy of surgical resection for GLM . From January 1993 to January 2011 , 73 patients underwent hepatectomy for GLM in the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery , Cancer Institute Ariake Hospital(Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research ) , Japan . The actuarial1 - , 3- , and 5-year overall survival rates and 1- , 3- , and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates of those 64 patients who achieved curative resections were 84 , 50 , and 37% , and 42 , 27 , and 27% , respectively . By multivariate analysis , serosal invasion of the primary gastric cancer and larger hepatic tumor(>5 cm in diameter)were found to be independent indicators of poor prognosis . Based on the multivariate analysis results , all patients were divided into three groups no poor prognostic factor(n=38) , one poor prognostic factor(n=24) , and two poor prognostic factors(n=2) . The actuarial overall survival rates of each group were 63 , 36 , and 0% at 3 years , and 53 , 15 , and 0% at 5 years . GLM patients having hepatic tumors with the maximum diameter of <5 cm , and without serosalinvasion of the primary gastric cancer , are the best candidates for hepatectomy .
The role of regulatory T cells ( T(regs) ) in human colon cancer ( CC ) remains controversial : high densities of tumor-infiltrating T(regs) can correlate with better or worse clinical outcomes depending on the study . In mouse models of cancer , T(regs) have been reported to suppress inflammation and protect the host , suppress T cells and protect the tumor , or even have direct cancer-promoting attributes . These different effects may result from the presence of different T(reg) subsets . We report the preferential expansion of a T(reg) subset in human CC with potent T cell-suppressive , but compromised anti-inflammatory , properties ; these cells are distinguished from T(regs) present in healthy donors by their coexpression of Foxp3 and RORgammat . T(regs) with similar attributes were found to be expanded in mouse models of hereditary polyposis . Indeed , ablation of the RORgammat gene in Foxp3(+) cells in polyp-prone mice stabilized T(reg) anti-inflammatory functions , suppressed inflammation , improved polyp-specific immune surveillance , and severely attenuated polyposis . Ablation of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , IL-23 , IL-17 , or tumor necrosis factor-alpha in polyp-prone mice reduced polyp number but not to the same extent as loss of RORgammat . Surprisingly , loss of IL-17A had a dual effect : IL-17A-deficient mice had fewer polyps but continued to have RORgammat(+) T(regs) and developed invasive cancer . Thus , we conclude that RORgammat has a central role in determining the balance between protective and pathogenic T(regs) in CC and that T(reg) subtype regulates inflammation , potency of immune surveillance , and severity of disease outcome .
Nuuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) are major transcription factors that have been associated with breast cancer metastasis by inducing matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) expression . In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effects of guggulsterone isomers ( cis or trans ) on 12-O-tetradecanoylpho-bol-13-acetate ( TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression . Cis-guggulsterone inhibited TPA-induced MMP expression by blocking IkappaB kinase ( IKK)/NF-kappaB signaling , whereas trans-guggulsterone blocked mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK)/AP-1 signaling . Cis-guggulsterone was more potent than trans-guggulsterone in the inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and invasion of MCF-7 cells . Furthermore , we found that the combination of these isomers exerted an additive effect on the inhibition of MCF-7 cell invasion . These results suggest that guggulsterone isomers downregulate MMP-9 expression and tumor cell invasion through the isomer-specific suppression of IKK/NF-kappaB and MAPK/AP-1 activation . In addition , the suppression of MMP-9 expression correlated well with the inhibition of cell invasion .
MYC deregulation is common in human cancer . IG-MYC translocations that are modeled in Emu-Myc mice occur in almost all cases of Burkitt lymphoma as well as in other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders . Deregulated expression of MYC results in increased mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) signaling . As tumors with mTORC1 activation are sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition , we used everolimus , a potent and specific mTORC1 inhibitor , to test the requirement for mTORC1 in the initiation and maintenance of Emu-Myc lymphoma . Everolimus selectively cleared premalignant B cells from the bone marrow and spleen , restored a normal pattern of B-cell differentiation , and strongly protected against lymphoma development . Established Emu-Myc lymphoma also regressed after everolimus therapy . Therapeutic response correlated with a cellular senescence phenotype and induction of p53 activity . Therefore , mTORC1-dependent evasion of senescence is critical for cellular transformation and tumor maintenance by MYC in B lymphocytes .
OBJECTIVE Lung cancer is a deadly cancer , whose kills more people worldwide than any other malignancy . SLUG ( SNAI2 , Snail2 ) is involved in the epithelial mesenchymal transition in physiological and in pathological contexts and is implicated in the development and progression of lung cancer . METHODS We constructed a lentivirus vector with SLUG shRNA ( LV-shSLUG ) . LV-shSLUG and a control lentivirus were infected into the non-small cell lung cancer cell A549 and real-time PCR , Western blot and IHC were applied to assess expression of the SLUG gene . Cell proliferation and migration were detected using MTT and clony formation methods . RESULTS Real-time PCR , Western Blot and IHC results confirmed down-regulation of SLUG expression by its shRNA by about 80% at both the mRNA and protein levels . Knockdown of SLUG significantly suppressed lung cancer cell proliferation . Furthermore , knockdown of SLUG significantly inhibited lung cancer cell invasion and metastasis . Finally , knockdown of SLUG induced the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of E-cadherin . CONCLUSION These results indicate that SLUG is a newly identified gene associated with lung cancer growth and metastasis . SLUG may serve as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of lung cancer in the future .
DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) representa serious threat for hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) . How cytokines and environmental signals integrate the DNA damage response and contribute to HSC-intrinsic DNA repair processes remains unknown . Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) and its receptor , Mpl , are critical factors supporting HSC self-renewal and expansion . Here , we uncover an unknown function for TPO-Mpl in the regulation of DNA damage response . We show that DNA repair following \u03b3-irradiation ( \u03b3-IR ) or the action of topoisomerase-II inhibitors is defective in Mpl(-/-) and in wild-type mouse or human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells treated in the absence of TPO . TPO stimulates DNA repair invitro and invivo by increasing DNA-PK-dependent nonhomologous end-joining efficiency . This ensures HSC chromosomal integrity and limits their long-term injury in response to IR.This shows that niche factors can modulate theHSC DSB repair machinery and opens new avenues for administration of TPO agonists for minimizing radiotherapy-induced HSC injury and mutagenesis .
Cancer vaccines based on human tumor-associated antigens ( TAA ) have been tested in patients with advanced or recurrent cancer , in combination with or following standard therapy . Their immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy has been difficult to properly evaluate in that setting characterized by multiple highly suppressive effects of the tumor and the standard therapy on the patient's immune system . In animal models of human cancer , vaccines administered in the prophylactic setting are most immunogenic and effectively prevent cancer development and progression . We report results of a clinical study that show that in patients without cancer but with a history of premalignant lesions ( advanced colonic adenomas , precursors to colon cancer ) , a vaccine based on the TAA MUC1 was highly immunogenic in 17 of 39 ( 43.6% ) of vaccinated individuals , eliciting high levels of anti-MUC1 immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) and long-lasting immune memory . Lack of response in 22 of 39 individuals was correlated with high levels of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSC ) prevaccination . Vaccine-elicited MUC1-specific immune response and immune memory were not associated with significant toxicity . Our study shows that vaccines based on human TAAs are immunogenic and safe and capable of eliciting long-term memory that is important for cancer prevention . We also show that in the premalignant setting , immunosuppressive environment ( e.g. , high levels of MDSC ) might already exist in some individuals , suggesting an even earlier premalignant stage or preselection of nonimmunosuppressed patients for prophylactic vaccination .

Evaluation of immune dysfunction during the tumor-bearing state is a critical issue in combating cancer . In this study , we initially found that IL-6 , one of the cachectic factors , suppressed CD4(+) T cell-mediated immunity through downregulation of MHC class II by enhanced arginase activity of dendritic cells ( DC ) in tumor-bearing mice . We demonstrated that administration of Ab against IL-6R ( anti-IL-6R mAb ) greatly enhanced T cell responses and inhibited the growth of tumor in vivo . We also found that IL-6 upregulated the expression of arginase-1 and arginase activity of DC in vitro . Tumor-infiltrating CD11c(+) DC exhibited upregulated mRNA expression of arginase-1 but reduced expression of MHC class II in parallel with the increase in serum IL-6 levels at the late stage in tumor-bearing hosts . However , the administration of anti-IL-6R mAb into tumor-bearing mice inhibited both the downmodulation of MHC class II and the upregulation of arginase-1 mRNA levels in DC . Furthermore , we noted that N(omega)-hydroxy-L-arginine or L-arginine , an arginase-1 inhibitor , blocked the reduction in MHC class II levels on CD11c(+) DC during the tumor-bearing state . Finally , we demonstrated that the administration of N(omega)-hydroxy-L-arginine at the peritumor site significantly enhanced CD4(+) T cell responses and inhibited tumor growth . Thus , IL-6-mediated arginase activation and the subsequent reduction in MHC class II expression on DC appeared to be critical mechanisms for inducing dysfunction of the immune system in the tumor-bearing state . Blockade of the IL-6-arginase cascade is a promising tool to overcome the dysfunction of antitumor immunity in tumor-bearing hosts .
The ASPP2 ( also known as 53BP2L ) tumor suppressor is a proapoptotic member of a family of p53 binding proteins that functions in part by enhancing p53-dependent apoptosis via its C-terminal p53-binding domain . Mounting evidence also suggests that ASPP2 harbors important nonapoptotic p53-independent functions . Structural studies identify a small G protein Ras-association domain in the ASPP2 N terminus . Because Ras-induced senescence is a barrier to tumor formation in normal cells , we investigated whether ASPP2 could bind Ras and stimulate the protein kinase Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade . We now show that ASPP2 binds to Ras-GTP at the plasma membrane and stimulates Ras-induced signaling and pERK1/2 levels via promoting Ras-GTP loading , B-Raf/C-Raf dimerization , and C-Raf phosphorylation . These functions require the ASPP2 N terminus because BBP ( also known as 53BP2S ) , an alternatively spliced ASPP2 isoform lacking the N terminus , was defective in binding Ras-GTP and stimulating Raf/MEK/ERK signaling . Decreased ASPP2 levels attenuated H-RasV12-induced senescence in normal human fibroblasts and neonatal human epidermal keratinocytes . Together , our results reveal a mechanism for ASPP2 tumor suppressor function via direct interaction with Ras-GTP to stimulate Ras-induced senescence in nontransformed human cells .
ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : Chemokine receptor CXCR4 , together with its ligand CXCL12 , plays critical roles in cancer progression , including growth , metastasis and angiogenesis . Ewing sarcoma is a sarcoma with poor prognosis despite current therapies , particularly for patients with advanced-stage disease . Lungs and bone ( marrow ) , organs of predilection for ( primary/metastatic ) Ewing sarcoma , represent predominant CXCL12 sources . METHODS : To gain insight into the role of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in Ewing sarcoma , CXCR4 , CXCL12 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha protein expression was studied in therapy-naive and metastatic tumors by immunohistochemistry . CXCR4 function was assessed in vitro , by flow cytometry and proliferation/ cell viability assays , in the presence of recombinant CXCL12 and/or CXCR4-antagonist AMD3100 or under hypoxic conditions . RESULTS : Whereas CXCR4 was predominantly expressed by tumor cells , CXCL12 was observed in both tumor and stromal areas . Survival analysis revealed an ( expression level-dependent ) negative impact of CXCR4 expression ( p < 0.04 ) . A role for the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in Ewing sarcoma growth was suggested by our observations that i ) CXCR4 expression correlated positively with tumor volume at diagnosis ( p = 0.013 ) , ii ) CXCL12 was present within the microenvironment of virtually all cases , iii ) CXCL12 induced proliferation of CXCR4-positive Ewing sarcoma cell lines , which could be abrogated by AMD3100 . CXCR4 expression was not correlated with occurrence of metastatic disease . Also , therapy-naive tumors demonstrated higher CXCR4 expression as compared to metastases ( p = 0.027 ) . Evaluation of in vivo hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression and culture of cells under hypoxic conditions revealed no role for hypoxia in CXCR4 expression . CONCLUSIONS : Together , our results imply a crucial role for the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in auto- and/or paracrine growth stimulation . Integration of CXCR4-targeting strategies into first- and/or second-line treatment regimens may represent a promising treatment option for Ewing sarcoma .
The down-regulation of dominant oncogenes , including C-MYC , in tumor cells often leads to the induction of senescence via mechanisms that are not completely identified . In the current study , we demonstrate that MYC-depleted melanoma cells undergo extensive DNA damage that is caused by the underexpression of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) and ribonucleotide reductase ( RR ) and subsequent depletion of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools . Simultaneous genetic inhibition of TS and RR in melanoma cells induced DNA damage and senescence phenotypes very similar to the ones caused by MYC-depletion . Reciprocally , overexpression of TS and RR in melanoma cells or addition of deoxyribo-nucleosides to culture media substantially inhibited DNA damage and senescence-associated phenotypes caused by C-MYC depletion . Our data demonstrate the essential role of TS and RR in C-MYC-dependent suppression of senescence in melanoma cells .
The activity of DNA methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1 ) is associated with diverse biological activities , including cell proliferation , senescence and cancer development . Here , we demonstrated that the HMG box-containing protein 1 ( HBP1 ) transcription factor is a new repressor of DNMT1 in a complex mechanism during senescence . The DNMT1 gene contains an HBP1-binding site at position -115 to -134bp from the transcriptional start site . HBP1 repressed the endogenous DNMT1 gene through sequence-specific binding , resulting in both gene-specific ( e.g. p16(INK4) ) and global DNA hypomethylation changes . The HBP1-mediated repression by DNMT1 contributed to replicative and premature senescence , the latter of which could be induced by Ras and HBP1 itself . A detailed investigation unexpectedly revealed that HBP1 has dual and complex transcriptional functions-both of which contribute to premature senescence . HBP1 both repressed the DNMT1 gene and activated the p16 gene in premature senescence . The opposite transcriptional functions proceeded through different DNA sequences and differential protein acetylation . While intricate , the reciprocal partnership between HBP1 and DNMT1 has exceptional importance , since its abrogation compromises senescence and promotes tumorigenesis . Together , our results suggest that the HBP1 transcription factor orchestrates a complex regulation of key genes during cellular senescence with an impact on overall DNA methylation state .
The aim of the present work was to study the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , mediated by bFGF signaling and its possible crosstalk with prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) in LNCaP and PC3-PSMA prostate cancer cell lines . PC3 cells stably transfected with PSMA gene were used for restoring PSMA expression . LNCaP and PC3-PSMA cells were exposed to 10ng/mL of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) . IL-6 production was measured by ELISA assay , and levels of PSMA expression were assessed by flow cytometry . AKT , ERK1/2 , and p38 phosphorylation were detected by Western blot. bFGF enhances IL-6 production in LNCaP and PC3-PSMA prostate cancer cells . The effect of bFGF on stimulating IL-6 secretion was greater in LNCaP than in PC3-PSMA cells . In the presence of bFGF , PSMA expression was activated after 4days of treatment in LNCaP and PC3-PSMA cells . This activation was not maintained after long term of treatment in both metastatic cell lines . Solely MAPKs pathways ( ERK1/2 and p38 ) were activated after bFGF stimulation in both metastatic cell lines , whereas AKT did not show any activation . The interference of the proinflammatory cytokine , IL-6 , with bFGF signaling and PSMA , should be of high clinical relevance in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer . In developing novel therapeutic modalities targeting IL-6 , significant attention should be given to PSMA and its inactivation to fight against prostate cancer .
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs or miR ) have been integrated into tumorigenic programs as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes . The miR-124 was reported to be attenuated in several tumors , such as glioma , medulloblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma . However , its role in cancer remains greatly elusive . In this study , we show that the miR-124 expression is significantly suppressed in human breast cancer specimens , which is reversely correlated to histological grade of the cancer . More intriguingly , ectopic expression of miR-124 in aggressive breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 strongly inhibits cell motility and invasive capacity , as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process . Also , lentivirus-delivered miR-124 endows MDA-MB-231 cells with the ability to suppress cell colony formation in vitro and pulmonary metastasis in vivo . Further studies have identified the E-cadherin transcription repressor Slug as a direct target gene of miR-124 ; its downregulation by miR-124 increases the expression of E-cadherin , a hallmark of epithelial cells and a repressor of cell invasion and metastasis . Moreover , knockdown of Slug notably impairs the motility of MDA-MB-231 cells , whereas re-expression of Slug abrogates the reduction of motility and invasion ability induced by miR-124 in MDA-MB-231 cells . These findings highlight an important role for miR-124 in the regulation of invasive and metastatic potential of breast cancer and suggest a potential application of miR-124 in cancer treatment .
Testicular Germ Cell Tumors ( TGCT ) and patient-derived cell lines are extremely sensitive to cisplatin and other interstrand cross-link ( ICL ) inducing agents . Nevertheless , a subset of TGCTs are either innately resistant or acquire resistance to cisplatin during treatment . Understanding the mechanisms underlying TGCT sensitivity/resistance to cisplatin as well as the identification of novel strategies to target cisplatin-resistant TGCTs have major clinical implications . Herein , we have examined the proficiency of five embryonal carcinoma ( EC ) cell lines to repair cisplatin-induced ICLs . Using \u03b3H2AX staining as a marker of double strand break formation , we found that EC cell lines were either incapable of or had a reduced ability to repair ICL-induced damage . The defect correlated with reduced Homologous Recombination ( HR ) repair , as demonstrated by the reduction of RAD51 foci formation and by direct evaluation of HR efficiency using a GFP-reporter substrate . HR-defective tumors cells are known to be sensitive to the treatment with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor . In line with this observation , we found that EC cell lines were also sensitive to PARP inhibitor monotherapy . The magnitude of sensitivity correlated with HR-repair reduced proficiency and with the expression levels and activity of PARP1 protein . In addition , we found that PARP inhibition strongly enhanced the response of the most resistant EC cells to cisplatin , by reducing their ability to overcome the damage . These results point to a reduced proficiency of HR repair as a source of sensitivity of ECs to ICL-inducing agents and PARP inhibitor monotherapy , and suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PARP can be exploited to target the stem cell component of the TGCTs ( namely ECs ) and to enhance the sensitivity of cisplatin-resistant TGCTs to standard treatments .
Environmental or occupational exposure to low doses of arsenic induces a series of health problems including cancer . The molecular events in arsenic-induced carcinogenicity remain to be defined . In the NuLi-1 immortalized human lung epithelial cell line with p53 and pRb deficiency , exposure to low doses of arsenic trioxide for 72 h promoted cell proliferation and upregulated the gene transcription levels of FOXM1 , CDC6 , CDC25A , and cyclin D1 , which are both critical cell cycle regulatory genes and proto-oncogenes . Continuous in vitro exposure to 1 <FFFD>M arsenic trioxide for 34 wks induced malignant cell transformation , as evidenced by enhanced anchorage-independent cell growth . The expression of FOXM1 , CDC6 , CDC25A , and Cyclin D1 was dynamically elevated at the gene transcription and protein levels in the process of cell transformation . The carcinogenic ability of transformed cell colonies coincides with the expression levels of FOXM1 in in vitro anchorage-independent growth assays and in vivo tumor xenograft formation assays . In reverse , the knockdown of FOXM1 in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells or arsenic-transformed NuLi-1 cells significantly decreased anchorage-independent cell growth and tumor xenograft formation . The transformed NuLi-1 cells showed genomic instability in the form of copy number variation ( CNV ) at chromosome 1 , 5 , 6 , 18 , and 20 , but not loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) . These results showed for the first time that chronic exposure to low doses of arsenic trioxide promoted lung carcinogenicity , in part by aberrantly upregulating FOXM1 and its associated oncogenes , when the tumor suppressor genes p53 and pRb were inactivated. <FFFD> 2012 Wiley Periodicals , Inc .
Gefitinib , the specific inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , may cause growth delay in cancer cell lines . Thorough understanding of the downstream cellular signaling of gefitinib will facilitate the discovery of biomarkers for predicting outcomes and monitoring anti-EGFR therapies , and provide information for key targets for therapeutic intervention . In this study , we investigated the role of transducer of erbB2.1 ( TOB1 ) in gefitinib therapy . Using the lung carcinoma cell lines A549 and NCI-H1975 , the results suggested that gefitinib might mediate cell cycle arrest in lung cancer cells at least by targeting TOB1 expression . Gefitinib treatment caused cell cycle arrest predominantly at the G1 phase , which is associated with TOB1 nuclear translocation and its interaction with cyclin D1 . We also showed that knockdown of TOB1 expression by RNAi rescued lung cancer cells from gefitinib-induced cell-proliferative arrest . These results suggest that TOB1 interaction with cyclin D1 and nuclear translocation is directly involved in the gefitinib-induced anti-proliferative cell cycle arrest .
Trinucleotide repeat ( TNR ) expansions and deletions are associated with human neurodegenerative diseases and prostate cancer . Recent studies have pointed to a linkage between oxidative DNA damage , base excision repair ( BER ) and TNR expansion , which is demonstrated by the observation that DNA polymerase \u03b2 ( pol \u03b2 ) gap-filling synthesis acts in concert with alternate flap cleavage by flap endonuclease 1 ( FEN1 ) to mediate CAG repeat expansions . In this study , we provide the first evidence that the repair of a DNA base lesion can also contribute to CAG repeat deletions that were initiated by the formation of hairpins on both the template and the damaged strand of a continuous run of ( CAG)(20 ) or ( CAG)(25 ) repeats . Most important , we found that pol \u03b2 not only bypassed one part of the large template hairpin but also managed to pass through almost the entire length of small hairpin . The unique hairpin bypass of pol \u03b2 resulted in large and small deletions in coordination with FEN1 alternate flap cleavage . Our results provide new insight into the role of BER in modulating genome stability that is associated with human diseases .
BACKGROUND : Although quiescence ( reversible cell cycle arrest ) is a key part in the life history and fate of many mammalian cell types , the mechanisms of gene regulation in quiescent cells are poorly understood . We sought to clarify the role of microRNAs as regulators of the cellular functions of quiescent human fibroblasts . RESULTS : Using microarrays , we discovered that the expression of the majority of profiled microRNAs differed between proliferating and quiescent fibroblasts . Fibroblasts induced into quiescence by contact inhibition or serum starvation had similar microRNA profiles , indicating common changes induced by distinct quiescence signals . By analyzing the gene expression patterns of microRNA target genes with quiescence , we discovered a strong regulatory function for miR-29 , which is downregulated with quiescence . Using microarrays and immunoblotting , we confirmed that miR-29 targets genes encoding collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins and that those target genes are induced in quiescence . In addition , overexpression of miR-29 resulted in more rapid cell cycle re-entry from quiescence . We also found that let-7 and miR-125 were upregulated in quiescent cells . Overexpression of either one alone resulted in slower cell cycle re-entry from quiescence , while the combination of both together slowed cell cycle re-entry even further . CONCLUSIONS : microRNAs regulate key aspects of fibroblast quiescence including the proliferative state of the cells as well as their gene expression profiles , in particular , the induction of extracellular matrix proteins in quiescent fibroblasts .
High-grade prostate cancers express high levels of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , major enzymes involved in tumor invasion and metastasis . However , the tumor cell lines commonly employed for prostate cancer research express only small amounts of MMPs when cultivated as monolayer cultures , in common culture media . The present study was conducted to ascertain whether culture conditions that include fibronectin can alter MMP2 and MMP9 expression by the human prostatic epithelial cell lines RWPE-1 , LNCaP and PC-3 . These cells were individually seeded at 2x10(4) cells/cm(2) , cultivated until they reached 80% confluence , and then exposed for 4h to fibronectin , after which the conditioned medium was analyzed by gelatin zymography . Untreated cells were given common medium . Only RWPE-1 cells express detectable amounts of MMP9 when cultivated in common medium , whereas the addition of fibronectin induced high expression levels of pro and active forms of MMP2 in all tested cell lines . Our findings demonstrate that normal and tumor prostate cell lines express MMP2 activity when in contact with extracellular matrix components or blood plasma proteins such as fibronectin . Future studies of transcriptomes and proteomes in prostate cancer research using these cell lines should not neglect these important conclusions .
In spite of the fact that they occur at high rates , the clinical responses of BRAF(V600) mutant metastatic melanoma to BRAF inhibitors are usually short-lasting , with most cases progressing within less than 8 mo . Immunomodulatory strategies initiated after progression have recently been reported to be poorly efficient . By characterizing the immunological interactions between T cells and cancer cells in clinical material as well as the influence of the FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib on the immune system , we aimed at unraveling new strategies to expand the efficacy of adoptive T-cell transfer , which represents one of the most promising approaches currently in clinical development for the treatment of metastatic melanoma . Here we show that blocking the BRAF-MAPK pathway in BRAF signaling-addicted melanoma cells significantly increases the ability of T cells contained in clinical grade tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to recognize autologous BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro . Antitumor reactivity was improved regardless of the class of antigen recognized by tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells . Microarray data suggests that improved tumor recognition is associated with modified expression of MHC Class I-associated proteins as well as of heat-shock proteins . In conclusion , our preclinical data suggest that an appropriately timed sequential treatment of BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma with vemurafenib and adoptive T-cell transfer might result in synergistic antineoplastic effects owing to an increased immunogenicity of cancer cells .
Although some types of carbon nanotubes ( CNTs ) have been described to induce mesothelioma in rodents and genotoxic effects in various cell systems , there are few previous studies on the genotoxicity of CNTs in mesothelial cells . Here , we examined in vitro DNA damage induction by short multi-wall CNTs ( MWCNTs ; 10-30 nm x 1-2 \u03bcm ) and single-wall CNTs ( SWCNTs ; >50% SWCNTs , other CNTs ; <2 nm x 1-5 \u03bcm ) in human mesothelial ( MeT-5A ) cells and bronchial epithelial ( BEAS 2B ) cells , using the single cell gel electrophoresis ( comet ) assay and the immunoslot blot assay for the detection of malondialdehyde ( M1dG ) DNA adducts . In BEAS 2B cells , we also studied the induction of micronuclei ( MN ) by the CNTs using the cytokinesis-block method . The cells were exposed to the CNTs ( 5-200 \u03bcg/cm(2) , corresponding to 19-760 \u03bcg/ml ) for 24 and 48h in the comet assay and for 48 and 72 h in the MN and M1dG assays . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) showed more MWCNT fibres and SWCNT clusters in BEAS 2B than MeT-5A cells , but no significant differences were seen in intracellular dose expressed as area of SWCNT clusters between TEM sections of the cell lines . In MeT-5A cells , both CNTs caused a dose-dependent induction of DNA damage ( % DNA in comet tail ) in the 48-h treatment and SWCNTs additionally in the 24-h treatment , with a statistically significant increase at 40 \u03bcg/cm(2) of SWCNTs and ( after 48 h ) 80 \u03bcg/cm(2) of both CNTs . SWCNTs also elevated the level of M1dG DNA adducts at 1 , 5 , 10 and 40 \u03bcg/cm(2) after the 48-h treatment , but both CNTs decreased M1dG adduct level at several doses after the 72-h treatment . In BEAS 2B cells , SWCNTs induced a statistically significant increase in DNA damage at 80 and 120 \u03bcg/cm(2) after the 24-h treatment and in M1dG adduct level at 5 \u03bcg/cm(2) after 48 h and 10 and 40 \u03bcg/cm(2) after 72 h ; MWCNTs did not affect the level of DNA damage but produced a decrease in M1dG adducts in the 72-h treatment . The CNTs did not affect the level of MN . In conclusion , MWCNTs and SWCNTs induced DNA damage in MeT-5A cells but showed a lower ( SWCNTs ) or no ( MWCNTs ) effect in BEAS 2B cells , suggesting that MeT-5A cells were more sensitive to the DNA-damaging effect of CNTs than BEAS 2B cells , despite the fact that more CNT fibres or clusters were seen in BEAS 2B than MeT-5A cells . M1dG DNA adducts were induced by SWCNTs but decreased after a 3-day exposure to MWCNTs and ( in MeT-5A cells ) SWCNTs , indicating that CNTs may lead to alterations in oxidative effects within the cells . Neither of the CNTs was able to produce chromosomal damage ( MN ) .
Bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) , used to treat severe hematological malignancies , often leads to potentially fatal acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , despite attempts for better matching and/or use of immune suppressive agents . We reported that embryo-derived PreImplantation-Factor plays a determining role in developing maternal/host tolerance towards the semi/allogenic embryo and regulating systemic immune response . Synthetic PIF ( PIF ) treatment is effective preventing immune attack in non-pregnant models of autoimmunity . Herein , we test PIF ability to prevent acute GVHD development in semi or totally allogenic murine models . We examine PIF's regulatory effect in vivo and in vitro , to control deleterious GVHD while maintaining its ability to preserve beneficial graft vs. leukemia ( GVL effect ) . Bone marrow and spleen cells from C57BL/6 donors were transplanted to semi-allogenic ( C57BL/6<FFFD>BALB/c ) F1 or allogenic ( BALB/c ) recipients , and then treated with PIF1mg/kg/day/2weeks . Short-term PIF administration reduced acute GVHD in both models and increased survival for up to four months after semi-(or totally ) allogenic BMT . The obtained effect was coupled with lessened skin ( semi-allogenic ) and decreased liver inflammation ( both models ) as well as reduced colon ulceration ( allogenic ) . Both GVHD associated cytokines and chemokines gene expression were decreased in the liver . PIF further lowered circulating interleukin-17 , but not interferon-gamma levels . PIF treatment was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro to lead to decreased iNOS expression and in LPS-activated macrophages to lower nitric oxide secretion . Significantly , PIF did not impair the beneficial GVL effect in the B-cell leukemia model . PIF primarily acts by inducing regulatory phenotype on monocytes/APC , which controls T-cell proliferation . Overall our data demonstrates that PIF protects against semi/allogenic GVHD long-term by reducing both target organ and systemic inflammation and by lowering oxidative stress , all while preserving the beneficial GVL effect .
There are many growth factors influencing the expansion of multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Angiogenesis is a process that may enhance MM growth , in various manners . Among them , insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) is a major factor , acting in many levels . The aim of the study was to measure serum levels of IGF-1 in newly diagnosed MM patients and to correlate them with clinical stage of the disease and with markers of angiogenesis , such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) , and interleukin-6 and 15 ( IL-6 and IL-15 ) . Serum levels of the above factors were measured , by ELISA , in 57 newly diagnosed MM patients and in 20 healthy controls . There was no difference in serum levels of IGF-1 in MM patients and in controls , contrary to angiogenic factors , which were higher in MM patients ( p < 0.001 ) . Similarly , IGF-1 did not correlate with clinical stage of the disease nor the other angiogenic factors , which also correlated with each other ( p < 0.001 ) . Serum IGF-1 concentrations are not influenced in MM patients . Therefore , although it is a proliferation cytokine , it cannot be used as marker of disease activity .
DNA damage signaling and repair take place in a chromatin context . Consequently , chromatin-modifying enzymes , including adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes , play an important role in the management of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) . Here , we show that the p400 ATPase is required for DNA repair by homologous recombination ( HR ) . Indeed , although p400 is not required for DNA damage signaling , DNA DSB repair is defective in the absence of p400 . We demonstrate that p400 is important for HR-dependent processes , such as recruitment of Rad51 to DSB ( a key component of HR ) , homology-directed repair , and survival after DNA damage . Strikingly , p400 and Rad51 are present in the same complex and both favor chromatin remodeling around DSBs . Altogether , our data provide a direct molecular link between Rad51 and a chromatin remodeling enzyme involved in chromatin decompaction around DNA DSBs .
We evaluated the clinical significance of indoleamine 2 , 3-dioxygenase ( IDO ) expression in breast cancer patients with bone metastasis . IDO activity can be measured by the tryptophan(Trp)/kynurenine(Kyn) ratio . Trp and Kyn levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . The serum IDO levels of postoperative breast cancer patients with a high number of bone metastases were lower than those of patients with a single metastasis lesion . In addition , IDO activity increased in the cases in which the number of metastatic lesions to the bone increased . These results suggest that the expression of IDO in breast cancer patients with bone metastasis may play a critical role in immunosuppression in these patients .
We report a case of recurrent gastric cancer successfully treated by a combination of CPT-11 and CDDP as the third- line chemotherapy . A 78-year-old man with advanced gastric cancer underwent a curative distal gastrectomy . Three years later , the tumor marker level began to rise and computed tomography ( CT ) revealed lymph node metastasis invading the pancreas resulting in pancreatic duct dilatation . S-1 treatment was initiated but was discontinued because of a systemic exanthem . Paclitaxel was administrated as secondary chemotherapy . But , after 2 courses , a further increase in the tumor marker level and portal vein invasion were observed . Combination therapy of CPT-11 and CDDP was administered as the third-line chemotherapy . After 3 courses , the tumor marker level normalized , tumor size decreased , and the invasion was eliminated . Third-line chemotherapy against recurrent gastric cancer should be considered if patient performance status ( PS ) is maintained .
Vaccination is , in theory , a safe and effective approach for controlling disseminated or metastatic cancer due to the specificity of the mammalian immune system , yet its success in the clinic has been hampered thus far by the problem of immune tolerance to tumor self-antigen . Here we describe a DNA vaccination strategy that is able to control cancer by overcoming immune tolerance to tumor self-antigen . We engineered a DNA construct encoding a dimeric form of a secreted single chain trimer of major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain , beta2-microglobulin , and peptide antigen linked to immunoglobulin G ( SCT-Ag/IgG ) . The chimeric protein was able to bind to antigen-specific CD8+ T cells with nearly 100% efficiency and strongly induce their activation and proliferation . In addition , the chimeric protein was able to coat professional antigen-presenting cells through the Fc receptor to activate antigen-specific CD8+ T cells . Furthermore , intradermal vaccination with DNA encoding SCT-Ag/IgG could generate significant numbers of cytotoxic effector T cells against tumor self-antigen and leads to successful therapeutic outcomes in a preclinical model of metastatic melanoma . Our data suggest that the DNA vaccine strategy described in the current study is able to break immune tolerance against endogenous antigen and result in potent therapeutic antitumor effects . Such strategy may be used in other antigenic systems for the control of infections and/or cancers .
The evidence that androgen blockade-resistant prostate cancer , termed castration resistant , remains androgen receptor ( AR ) dependent is compelling . AR is re-activated through multiple mechanisms including expression of constitutively active splice variants that lack hormone binding domains ( HBDs ) . This highlights need to develop therapies that target regions other than the HBD . Because the p160 coactivators interact most strongly with the amino-terminus of AR , we examined the consequences of disrupting this interaction . We identified two overlapping SRC-1 peptides that interact with AR , but not with progesterone receptor . These peptides reduce AR and AR variant AR-V7 dependent induction of an AR responsive reporter . Using mammalian two hybrid assays , we found that the peptides interrupt the AR/SRC-1 , AR/SRC-2 and AR N/C interactions , but not SRC-1/CARM-1 interactions . Consistent with the SRC-1 dependence of induced , but not repressed genes , in LNCaP cells , the peptides inhibited hormone dependent induction of endogenous target genes including PSA and TMPRSS2 , but did not block AR dependent repression of UGT2B17 or inhibit vitamin D receptor activity . Simultaneous detection of SRC-1 peptides and PSA by double immunofluorescence in transfected LNCaP cells clearly demonstrated a strong reduction in PSA levels in cells expressing the peptides . The peptides also inhibited the AR dependent expression of PSA in castration resistant C4-2 cells . Moreover they inhibited androgen dependent proliferation of LNCaP cells and proliferation of C4-2 cells in androgen depleted medium without affecting AR negative PC-3 cells . Thus , the p160 coactivator binding site is a novel potential therapeutic target to inhibit AR activity .
AIM : To explore the inhibitory effect of sulfated polysaccharide from Masson pine ( Pinus massoniana ) pollen ( SPPM60 ) on G(2)/M phase of human liver cancer HepG2 cells and its mechanism . METHODS : The proliferation rate of HepG2 cells was evaluated by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT ) colorimetric assay . The cycles of HepG2 cells were measured by flow cytometry when 200mug/ml concentration of SPPM60 was adopted , the expression of the genes related to cell cycle was detected by real-time PCR . RESULTS : SPPM60 inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells and the inhibition rate was elevated with increase of SPPM60 concentration . After treatment with 200mug/ml of SPPM60 , the percentage of S phase cells was decreased , but that of G(2)/M phase was significantly increased ( 72h vs control : 32.96<FFFD>0.33% vs 18.59<FFFD>0.04% , 3.44<FFFD>0.05% vs 18.30<FFFD>0.08% , P<0.01 ) . The results of real-time PCR showed that SPPM60 could down-regulate the mRNA levels of CDK1 and CyclinB ( P<0.01 ) , and up-regulate the expression of p53 and p21 ( P<0.05 ) . CONCLUSION : SPPM60 causes arrest of HepG2 cells at G(2)/M phase , and the mechanism is related to the down-regulation of CDK1 and CyclinB and up-regulation of p53 and p21 expression .
Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) is a fatal pediatric disease . Thus far no therapeutic agent has proven beneficial in the treatment of this malignancy . Hence , conventional DNA-damaging radiotherapy ( RT ) remains the standard treatment , providing transient neurological improvement without improving probability of overall survival . During RT , WEE1 kinase controls the G2 cell cycle checkpoint allowing for repair of irradiation ( IR)-induced DNA damage . Here we show that WEE1 kinase is one of the highest overexpressed kinases in primary DIPG tissues as compared to matching non-neoplastic brain tissues . Inhibition of WEE1 by MK-1775 treatment of DIPG cells inhibited the IR-induced WEE1-mediated phosphorylation of CDC2 , resulting in reduced G2/M arrest and decreased cell viability . Finally , we demonstrate that MK-1775 enhances the radiation response of E98-Fluc-mCherry DIPG mouse xenografts . Altogether , these results show that inhibition of WEE1 kinase in conjunction with RT holds potential as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of DIPG .
The role of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-20 ( IL-20 ) has not yet been studied in cancer biology . Here , we demonstrated up-regulation of both IL-20 and IL-20R1 in muscle invasive bladder cancer ( MIBC ) patients . The expressions of IL-20 and IL-20R1 were observed in bladder cancer 5637 and T-24 cells . We found that IL-20 significantly increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-9 via binding activity of NF-kappaB and AP-1 in bladder cancer cells and stimulated the activation of ERK1/2 , JNK , p38MAPK , and Jak-Stat signaling . Among the pathways examined , only ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 significantly inhibited IL-20-induced migration and invasion . Moreover , siRNA knockdown of IL-20R1 suppressed migration , invasion , ERK1/2 activation , and NF-kappaB-mediated MMP-9 expression induced by IL-20 . Unexpectedly , cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1 was induced by IL-20 treatment without altering cell cycle progression . Blockade of p21WAF1 function by siRNA reversed migration , invasion , activation of ERK signaling , MMP-9 expression , and activation of NF-kappaB in IL-20-treated cells . In addition , IL-20 induced the activation of IKK , the degradation and phosphorylation of IkappaBa , and NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation , which was regulated by ERK1/2 . IL-20 stimulated the recruitment of p65 to the MMP-9 promoter region . Finally , the IL-20-induced migration and invasion of cells was confirmed by IL-20 gene transfection and by addition of anti-IL-20 antibody . This is the first report that p21WAF1 is involved in ERK1/2-mediated MMP-9 expression via increased binding activity of NF-kappaB , which resulted in the induction of migration in IL-20/IL-20R1 dyad-induced bladder cancer cells . These unexpected results might provide a critical new target for the treatment of bladder cancer .
Each year , more than 700,000 people undergo cancer surgery in the United States . However , more than 40% of those patients develop recurrences and have a poor outcome . Traditionally , the medical community has assumed that recurrent tumors arise from selected tumor clones that are refractory to therapy . However , we found that tumor cells have few phenotypical differences after surgery . Thus , we propose an alternative explanation for the resistance of recurrent tumors . Surgery promotes inhibitory factors that allow lingering immunosuppressive cells to repopulate small pockets of residual disease quickly . Recurrent tumors and draining lymph nodes are infiltrated with M2 ( CD11b(+)F4/80(hi)CD206(hi) and CD11b(+)F4/80(hi)CD124(hi) ) macrophages and CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells . This complex network of immunosuppression in the surrounding tumor microenvironment explains the resistance of tumor recurrences to conventional cancer vaccines despite small tumor size , an intact antitumor immune response , and unaltered cancer cells . Therapeutic strategies coupling antitumor agents with inhibition of immunosuppressive cells potentially could impact the outcomes of more than 250,000 people each year .
Hypoxia is known to play critical roles in cell survival , angiogenesis , tumor invasion , and metastasis . Hypoxia mediated over-expression of hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) has been shown to be associated with therapeutic resistance , and contributes to poor prognosis of cancer patients . Emerging evidence suggest that hypoxia and HIF pathways contributes to the acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , maintenance of cancer stem cell ( CSC ) functions , and also maintains the vicious cycle of inflammation-all which lead to therapeutic resistance . However , the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which hypoxia/HIF drives these events are not fully understood . Here , we show , for the first time , that hypoxia leads to increased expression of VEGF , IL-6 , and CSC signature genes Nanog , Oct4 and EZH2 consistent with increased cell migration/invasion and angiogenesis , and the formation of pancreatospheres , concomitant with increased expression of miR-21 and miR-210 in human pancreatic cancer ( PC ) cells . The treatment of PC cells with CDF , a novel synthetic compound inhibited the production of VEGF and IL-6 , and down-regulated the expression of Nanog , Oct4 , EZH2 mRNAs , as well as miR-21 and miR-210 under hypoxia . CDF also led to decreased cell migration/invasion , angiogenesis , and formation of pancreatospheres under hypoxia . Moreover , CDF decreased gene expression of miR-21 , miR-210 , IL-6 , HIF-1alpha , VEGF , and CSC signatures in vivo in a mouse orthotopic model of human PC . Collectively , these results suggest that the anti-tumor activity of CDF is in part mediated through deregulation of tumor hypoxic pathways , and thus CDF could become a novel , and effective anti-tumor agent for PC therapy .
The ATM/ATR DNA damage checkpoint functions in the maintenance of genetic stability and some missense variants of the ATM gene have been shown to confer a moderate increased risk of prostate cancer . However , whether inactivation of this checkpoint contributes directly to prostate specific cancer predisposition is still unknown . Here , we show that exposure of non-malignant prostate epithelial cells ( HPr-1AR ) to androgen led to activation of the ATM/ATR DNA damage response and induction of cellular senescence . Notably , knockdown of the ATM gene expression in HPr-1AR cells can promote androgen-induced TMPRSS2 : ERG rearrangement , a prostate-specific chromosome translocation frequently found in prostate cancer cells . Intriguingly , unlike the non-malignant prostate epithelial cells , the ATM/ATR DNA damage checkpoint appears to be defective in prostate cancer cells , since androgen treatment only induced a partial activation of the DNA damage response . This mechanism appears to preserve androgen induced autophosphorylation of ATM and phosphorylation of H2AX , lesion processing and repair pathway yet restrain ATM/CHK1/CHK2 and p53 signaling pathway . Our findings demonstrate that ATM/ATR inactivation is a crucial step in promoting androgen-induced genomic instability and prostate carcinogenesis .
Prostate cancer is the most frequent and second most lethal cancer in men in the United States . Innate immunity and inflammation may increase the risk of prostate cancer . To determine the role of innate immunity and inflammation in advanced prostate cancer , we investigated the association of 320 single nucleotide polymorphisms , located in 46 genes involved in this pathway , with disease risk using 494 cases with advanced disease and 536 controls from Cleveland , Ohio . Taken together , the whole pathway was associated with advanced prostate cancer risk ( P = 0.02 ) . Two sub-pathways ( intracellular antiviral molecules and extracellular pattern recognition ) and four genes in these sub-pathways ( TLR1 , TLR6 , OAS1 , and OAS2 ) were nominally associated with advanced prostate cancer risk and harbor several SNPs nominally associated with advanced prostate cancer risk . Our results suggest that the innate immunity and inflammation pathway may play a modest role in the etiology of advanced prostate cancer through multiple small effects .
Binding within or nearby target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival enables the p53 tumor suppressor gene to regulate their transcription and cell-cycle progression . Using genome-wide chromatin-binding profiles , we describe binding of p53 also to regions located distantly from any known p53 target gene . Interestingly , many of these regions possess conserved p53-binding sites and all known hallmarks of enhancer regions . We demonstrate that these p53-bound enhancer regions ( p53BERs ) indeed contain enhancer activity and interact intrachromosomally with multiple neighboring genes to convey long-distance p53-dependent transcription regulation . Furthermore , p53BERs produce , ina p53-dependent manner , enhancer RNAs ( eRNAs ) that are required for efficient transcriptional enhancement of interacting target genes and induction of a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest . Thus , our results ascribe transcription enhancement activity to p53 with the capacity to regulate multiple genes from a single genomic binding site . Moreover , eRNA production from p53BERs is required for efficient p53 transcription enhancement .
To protect the genome , cells have evolved a diverse set of pathways designed to sense , signal , and repair multiple types of DNA damage . To assess the degree of coordination and crosstalk among these pathways , we systematically mapped changes in the cell's genetic network across a panel of different DNA-damaging agents , resulting in differential measurements . Each agent was associated with a distinct interaction pattern , which , unlike single-mutant phenotypes or gene expression data , has high statistical power to pinpoint the specific repair mechanisms at work . The agent-specific networks revealed roles for the histone acetyltranferase Rtt109 in the mutagenic bypass of DNA lesions and the neddylation machinery in cell-cycle regulation and genome stability , while the network induced by multiple agents implicates Irc21 , an uncharacterized protein , in checkpoint control and DNA repair . Our multiconditional genetic interaction map provides a unique resource that identifies agent-specific and general DNA damage response pathways .
AMPK is a metabolic sensor that helps maintain cellular energy homeostasis . Despite evidence linking AMPK with tumor suppressor functions , the role of AMPK in tumorigenesis and tumor metabolism isunknown . Here we show that AMPK negatively regulates aerobic glycolysis ( the Warburg effect ) in cancer cells and suppresses tumor growth invivo . Genetic ablation of the \u03b11 catalytic subunit of AMPK accelerates Myc-induced lymphomagenesis . Inactivation of AMPK\u03b1 in both transformed and nontransformed cells promotes a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis , increased allocation of glucose carbon into lipids , and biomass accumulation . These metabolic effects require normoxic stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 ( HIF-1\u03b1 ) , as silencing HIF-1\u03b1 reverses the shift to aerobic glycolysis and the biosynthetic and proliferative advantages conferred by reduced AMPK\u03b1 signaling . Together our findings suggest that AMPK activity opposes tumor development and that its loss fosters tumor progression in part by regulating cellular metabolic pathways that support cell growth and proliferation .
Bisphenol A ( BPA ) is one of the most prevalent chemicals in daily-use materials , therefore , human exposure to BPA is ubiquitous . We found that low concentrations of BPA stimulate the spermatogonial GC-1 cells proliferation by G protein-coupled receptor 30 ( GPR30)-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR)-extracellular regulated kinase ( ERK)-c-Fos pathway . However , through the same pathway GPR30 expression has been shown to be induced by EGF , an EGFR ligand . Thus , we want to know if low concentrations of BPA are able to induce the GPR30 expression and the possible mechanism(s) in GC-1 cells . By transient transfection with expression plasmids , 10(-9)M BPA significantly transactivates the Gpr30-5'-flanking region through activating the GPR30 , cGMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKG ) , estrogen receptor-alpha ( ER-alpha ) , and EFGR-ERK pathways . Furthermore , an activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) site located within this region is found to be responsible for the transactivation of BPA . Expectedly , through the same pathways , BPA significantly induces the gene and protein expression of GPR30. c-Fos is further observed to be strongly recruited to the AP-1 site in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and its dysfunction on the AP-1 site markedly suppresses the expression of GPR30 , p-ERK1/2 , p-Ser118-ER-alpha and cell proliferation by BPA . Our results demonstrate that a low-concentration BPA induces GPR30 expression through the GPR30-EFGR-ERK-c-Fos , ER-alpha , and PKG pathways , presumably boosting the cells proliferation via a regulatory loop . The present study provides a novel insight into the potential role of GPR30 in the initiation and progression of male germ cell cancer induced by environmentally relevant BPA .
A new line of human ovarian serous adenocarcinoma cells , TU-OS-4 , was established and characterized . The cells showed a short , spindle-shaped morphology and grew in monolayers without contact inhibition while forming an arrangement resembling a jigsaw puzzle . Chromosome numbers ranged from 55 to 73 . The proliferation rate was lower than other serous adenocarcinoma cell lines tested ( KF , SHIN-3 , and SK-OV-3 ) , and the doubling time was 53.3 h . Western blot analysis showed that TU-OS-4 cells overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptor , human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) 2 , and phosphorylated HER2 protein . The IC(50) values to cisplatin , paclitaxel , and lapatinib were 25.8 \u03bcM , 686 nM , and 183 nM , respectively . Heterotransplantation in nude mice reflected the original tumor of the cells . These results suggested that this cell line would be useful to study chemoresistant mechanisms and contribute to establishing novel treatment strategies for patients with ovarian cancer .
Cells undergoing malignant transformation often exhibit a shift in cellular metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis . This glycolytic shift , called the Warburg effect , provides a mechanistic basis for targeting glycolysis to suppress carcinogenesis through the use of dietary caloric restriction and energy restriction-mimetic agents ( ERMA ) . We recently reported the development of a novel class of ERMAs that exhibits high potency in eliciting starvation-associated cellular responses and epigenetic changes in cancer cells though glucose uptake inhibition . The lead ERMA in this class , OSU-CG5 , decreases the production of ATP and NADH in LNCaP prostate cancer cells . In this study , we examined the effect of OSU-CG5 on the severity of preneoplastic lesions in male transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate ( TRAMP ) mice . Daily oral treatment with OSU-CG5 at 100 mg/kg from 6 to 10 weeks of age resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the weight of urogenital tract and microdissected dorsal , lateral , and anterior prostatic lobes relative to vehicle controls . The suppressive effect of OSU-CG5 was evidenced by marked decreases in Ki67 immunostaining and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) expression in the prostate . OSU-CG5 treatment was not associated with evidence of systemic toxicity . Microarray analysis indicated a central role for Akt , and Western blot analysis showed reduced phosphorylation and/or expression levels of Akt , Src , androgen receptor , and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor in prostate lobes . These findings support further investigation of OSU-CG5 as a potential chemopreventive agent .
In the present study , the question was addressed whether anthocyanins interfere with the topoisomerase I poison irinotecan in vivo . In vivo complexes of enzyme to DNA bioassay was used to detect irinotecan-induced stabilization of topoisomerase I/DNA complexes and single cell gel electrophoresis to determine DNA-strand-break induction in the colon of male Wistar rats . Furthermore , analysis of anthocyanin concentrations in rat plasma and rat colon was included in the testing , demonstrating that anthocyanins reach the colon and the concentrations do not differ between rats that only received anthocyanins and the anthocyanin/irinotecan group . Blackberry extract was found to significantly reduce irinotecan-mediated topoisomerase I/DNA cleavable complex formation . Overall , anthocyanins did not notably increase cleavable complex formation . However , a significant increase of DNA damage was shown after a single dose of irinotecan as well as the single compounds cyanidin ( cy ) and cyanidin-3-glucoside ( cy-3-g ) . Furthermore , a significant reduction of irinotecan-induced DNA-strand breaks after a pretreatment with cy , cy-3-g and blackberry extract was observed . Thus , the question arises whether anthocyanin-rich preparations might interfere with chemotherapy or whether , due to low systemic bioavailability , the preparations might provide protective potential in the gastrointestinal tract .
Splenic haemangiosarcomas ( HSAs ) from 122 dogs were characterized and classified according to their patterns of growth , survival time post splenectomy , metastases and chemotherapy . The most common pattern of growth was a mixture of cavernous , capillary and solid tumour tissue . Survival time post splenectomy was independent of the growth pattern ; however , it was influenced by chemotherapy and metastases . Immunohistochemical assessment of the expression of angiogenic factors ( fetal liver kinase-1 , angiopoietin-2 , angiopoietin receptor-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor A ) and conventional endothelial markers ( CD31 , factor VIII-related antigen ) revealed variable expression , particularly in undifferentiated HSAs . Therefore , a combination of endothelial markers should be used to confirm the endothelial origin of splenic tumours .
Bladder cancer ( BCa ) remained a major health problem . Med19 was related to tumor growth of BCa . Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) were reported to be critical in bone metastasis of cancer . We therefore investigated the relations between Med19 and BMPs in BCa and their effect on bone metastasis of BCa . Bladder cancer cell lines were cultured and interfered with Med19 shRNA and control . Expressions of BMP-1 , BMP-2 , BMP-4 , BMP-5 , BMP-6 , BMP-7 , BMP-9 , and BMP-15 were studied between 2 groups . Fifty-two BCa samples were included for immunohistochemical staining of Med19 and BMP-2 . Expressions were scored and studied statistically . Invasiveness was studied with Transwell assay . Silencing or Med19 in BCa cells induced altered expressions of BMPs . Increased expressions of BMP-1 , BMP-4 , BMP-6 , BMP-7 , and BMP-15 and decreased expressions of BMP-2 , BMP-5 , and BMP-9 were noticed , but only BMP-2 reached statistical significance . Expressions of Med19 and BMP-2 were significantly higher in cases with bone metastasis and were positively correlated in cases with bone metastasis and muscle invasion . Med19 is a critical factor involved in the invasiveness and promotion of bone metastasis of BCa , possibly via BMP-2 .
AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) has been implicated in anti-proliferative actions in a range of cell systems . Recently , it was observed that Compound C , an inhibitor of AMPK , also reduced the cell viability in human diploid fibroblasts ( HDFs ) . Compound C-induced growth arrest was associated with a decrease in the cell cycle regulatory proteins , such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen , phosphorylated pRB , cyclin-dependent protein kinases ( Cdk 2 and 4 ) , cyclins ( D and E ) , and the Cdk inhibitors ( p21 , p16 , and p27 ) . Therefore , the present study examined the molecular mechanism of the antiproliferative effects of Compound C. Although Compound C inhibited serum-induced phosphorylation of Akt and its substrate , glycogen synthase kinase-3beta , it did not affect the Akt activity in vitro . Compound C significantly inhibited the receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and the activity of downstream signaling molecules , such as p85 phosphoinositide 3-kinase , phospholipase C-gamma1 , and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 , induced by platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) but not by epidermal growth factor- and insulin-like growth factor . In vitro growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity profiling revealed the IC(50) for PDGF receptor-beta ( PDGFRbeta ) to be 5.07 muM , whereas the IC(50) for the epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor was >=100 muM . The inhibitory effect of Compound C on PDGFRbeta and Akt was also observed in AMPKalpha(1)/alpha(2)-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts , indicating that its inhibitory effect is independent of the AMPK activity . The inhibitory effect of Compound C on cell proliferation and PDGFRbeta tyrosine phosphorylation was also demonstrated in various PDGFR-expressing cells , including MRC-5 , BEAS-2B , rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells , and A172 glioblastoma cells . These results indicate that Compound C can be used as a potential antiproliferative agent for PDGF- or PDGFR-associated diseases , such as cancer , atherosclerosis , and fibrosis .
BACKGROUND O(6) -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) is a DNA repair enzyme that can protect cells from carcinogenic effects of alkylating agents by removing adducts from the O(6) position of guanine . Evidences indicated that areca quid chewing may increase the risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) . This study was to investigate the role of MGMT expression in OSCCs and the normal oral tissues . METHODS Thirty-two OSCCs from areca quid chewers and ten normal oral tissue biopsy samples without areca quid chewing were analyzed by the immunohistochemistry for MGMT . Primary human oral keratinocytes ( HOKs ) were challenged with arecoline , the major alkaloid of areca nut , by Western blot . Nicotine , an important component of cigarette smoke , was added to find the possible regulatory mechanisms . RESULTS Significant association was observed between low MGMT expression and advanced clinical stage of OSCCs and lymph node metastasis ( P=0.03 ) . MGMT expression was significantly higher in patients only chewing areca quid than patients both chewing areca quid and smoking ( P=0.028 ) . Arecoline was found to elevate MGMT expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner . The addition of nicotine was found to enhance arecoline-induced MGMT expression . CONCLUSION Our results indicate that MGMT could be used clinically as a predictive marker for tumor processing , the potential for lymph node metastasis as well as advanced clinical stage . MGMT expression was significantly upregulated by arecoline in HOKs . Nicotine has a synergistic effect of arecoline-induced MGMT expression . The cigarette smoking may act synergistically in the pathogenesis of OSCC in areca quid chewers via the upregulation of MGMT .
Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in Western countries . A significant number of CRC patients undergoing curatively intended surgery subsequently develop recurrence and die from the disease . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are aberrantly expressed in cancers and appear to have both diagnostic and prognostic significance . In this study , we identified novel miRNAs associated with recurrence of CRC , and their possible mechanism of action . TaqMan<FFFD> Human MicroRNA Array Set v2.0 was used to profile the expression of 667 miRNAs in 14 normal colon mucosas and 46 microsatellite stable CRC tumors . Four miRNAs ( miR-362-3p , miR-570 , miR-148a* and miR-944 ) were expressed at a higher level in tumors from patients with no recurrence ( p < 0.015 ) , compared to tumors from patients with recurrence . A significant association with increased disease free survival was confirmed for miR-362-3p in a second independent cohort of 43 CRC patients , using single TaqMan<FFFD> microRNA assays . In vitro functional analysis showed that over-expression of miR-362-3p in colon cancer cell lines reduced cell viability , and proliferation mainly due to cell cycle arrest . E2F1 , USF2 and PTPN1 were identified as potential miR-362-3p targets by mRNA profiling of HCT116 cells over-expressing miR-362-3p . Subsequently , these genes were confirmed as direct targets by Luciferase reporter assays . Their knockdown in vitro phenocopied the effects of miR-362-3p over-expression . We conclude that miR-362-3p may be a novel prognostic marker in CRC , and hypothesize that the positive effects of augmented miR-362-3p expression may in part be mediated through the targets E2F1 , USF2 and PTPN1. <FFFD> 2012 Wiley Periodicals , Inc .
Growth differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ) and the CCN family member , connective tissue growth factor ( CCN2 ) , are associated with cardiac disease , inflammation and cancer . The precise role and signaling mechanism for these factors in normal and diseased tissues remains elusive . Here we demonstrate an interaction between GDF-15 and CCN2 using yeast two-hybrid assays and have mapped the domain of interaction to the von Willebrand factor type C domain of CCN2 . Biochemical pull down assays using secreted GDF-15 and His-tagged CCN2 produced in PC-3 prostate cancer cells confirmed a direct interaction between these proteins . To investigate the functional consequences of this interaction , in vitro angiogenesis assays were performed . We demonstrate that GDF-15 blocks CCN2-mediated tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial ( HUVEC ) cells . To examine the molecular mechanism whereby GDF-15 inhibits CCN2-mediated angiogenesis , activation of alpha(V) beta(3) integrins and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) was examined . CCN2-mediated FAK activation was inhibited by GDF-15 and was accompanied by a decrease in alpha(V) beta(3) integrin clustering in HUVEC cells . These results demonstrate , for the first time , a novel signaling pathway for GDF-15 through interaction with the matricellular signaling molecule CCN2 . Furthermore , antagonism of CCN2 mediated angiogenesis by GDF-15 may provide insight into the functional role of GDF-15 in disease states . J. Cell . Biochem. <FFFD> 2012 Wiley Periodicals , Inc .
MD-Fraction is a highly purified soluble beta-glucan derived from Grifola frondosa ( an oriental edible mushroom ) . Intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection of MD-Fraction has been reported to inhibit tumor growth via enhancement of the host immune system . In this study , we demonstrated that oral administration of MD-Fraction as well as i.p. injection significantly inhibited tumor growth in murine tumor models . After oral administration , MD-Fraction was not transferred to the blood in its free form but was captured by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells ( DCs ) present in the Peyer's patch . The captured MD-Fraction was then transported to the spleen , thereby inducing the systemic immune response . Our study showed that MD-Fraction directly induced DC maturation via a C-type lectin receptor dectin-1 pathway . The therapeutic response of orally administered MD-Fraction was associated with ( i ) induced systemic tumor-antigen specific T cell response via dectin-1-dependent activation of DCs , ( ii ) increased infiltration of the activated T cells into the tumor , and ( iii ) decreased number of tumor-caused immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells . Our preclinical study suggests that MD-Fraction is a useful oral therapeutic agent in the management of patients with cancer. <FFFD> 2012 Wiley Periodicals , Inc .
Elevated androgen receptor ( AR ) activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) may occur through increased levels of AR coactivator proteins . Vav3 , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) , is upregulated following progression to castration-resistance in preclinical models and is overexpressed in a significant number of human prostate cancers . Vav3 is a novel coactivator of the AR . We sought to identify Vav3 binding partners in an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying Vav3 enhancement of AR activity and to identify new therapeutic targets . The cell division cycle 37 homolog ( Cdc37 ) , a protein kinase-specific co-chaperone for Hsp90 , was identified as a Vav3 interacting protein by yeast two hybrid screening . Vav3-Cdc37 interaction was confirmed by GST pulldown and , for native proteins , by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in prostate cancer cells . Cdc37 potentiated Vav3 coactivation of AR transcriptional activity and Vav3 enhancement of AR amino-carboxyl terminal ( N-C ) interaction , which is essential for optimal receptor transcriptional activity . Cdc37 increased prostate cancer cell proliferation selectively in Vav3 expressing cells . Cdc37 did not affect Vav3 nucleotide exchange activity , Vav3 protein levels or subcellular localization . Disruption of Vav3-Cdc37 interaction inhibited Vav3 enhancement of AR transcriptional activity and AR N-C interaction . Diminished Vav3-Cdc37 interaction also caused decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation selectively in Vav3 expressing cells . Taken together , we identified a novel Vav3 interacting protein that enhances Vav3 coactivation of AR and prostate cancer cell proliferation . Vav3-Cdc37 interaction may provide a new therapeutic target in prostate cancer .
The pancreatic stellate cells ( PSCs ) have complex roles in pancreas , including tissue repair and fibrosis . PSCs surround ATP releasing exocrine cells , but little is known about purinergic receptors and their function in PSCs . Our aim was to resolve whether PSCs express the multifunctional P2X7 receptor and elucidate how it regulates PSC viability . The number of PSCs isolated from wild type ( WT ) mice was 50% higher than those from the Pfizer P2X7 receptor knock out ( KO ) mice . The P2X7 receptor protein and mRNA of all known isoforms were expressed in WT PSCs , while KO PSCs only expressed truncated versions of the receptor . In culture , the proliferation rate of the KO PSCs was significantly lower . Inclusion of apyrase reduced the proliferation rate in both WT and KO PSCs , indicating importance of endogenous ATP . Exogenous ATP had a two-sided effect . Proliferation of both WT and KO cells was stimulated with ATP in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximum effect at 100 microM . At high ATP concentration ( 5 mM ) , WT PSCs , but not the KO PSCs died . The intracellular Ca(2+) signals and proliferation rate induced by micromolar ATP concentrations were inhibited by the allosteric P2X7 receptor inhibitor az10606120 . The P2X7 receptor-pore inhibitor A438079 partially prevented cell death induced by millimolar ATP concentrations . This study shows that ATP and P2X7 receptors are important regulators of PSC proliferation and death , and therefore might be potential targets for treatments of pancreatic fibrosis and cancer .
Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the most prevalent liver tumor and a deadly disease with limited therapeutic options . Dysregulation of cell signaling pathways is a common denominator in tumorigenesis , including hepatocarcinogenesis . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signaling system is commonly activated in HCC , and is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic target in combination therapies . We and others have identified a central role for the EGFR ligand amphiregulin ( AR ) in the proliferation , survival and drug resistance of HCC cells . AR expression is frequently up-regulated in HCC tissues and cells through mechanisms not completely known . Here we identify the beta-catenin signaling pathway as a novel mechanism leading to transcriptional activation of the AR gene in human HCC cells . Activation of beta-catenin signaling , or expression of the T41A beta-catenin active mutant , led to the induction of AR expression involving three specific beta-catenin-Tcf responsive elements in its proximal promoter . We demonstrate that HCC cells expressing the T41A beta-catenin active mutant show enhanced proliferation that is dependent in part on AR expression and EGFR signaling . We also demonstrate here a novel cross-talk of the EGFR system with fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19 ) . FGF19 is a recently identified driver gene in hepatocarcinogenesis and an activator of beta-catenin signaling in HCC and colon cancer cells . We show that FGF19 induced AR gene expression through the beta-catenin pathway in human HCC cells . Importantly , AR up-regulation and EGFR signaling participated in the induction of cyclin D1 and cell proliferation elicited by FGF19 . Finally , we demonstrate a positive correlation between FGF19 and AR expression in human HCC tissues , therefore supporting in clinical samples our experimental observations . These findings identify the AR/EGFR system as a key mediator of FGF19 responses in HCC cells involving beta-catenin signaling , and suggest that combined targeting of FGF19 and AR/EGFR may enhance therapeutic efficacy .
Lung cancers express the cholinergic autocrine loop , which facilitates the progression of cancer cells . The antagonists of mAChRs have been demonstrated to depress the growth of small cell lung cancers ( SCLCs ) . In this study we intended to investigate the growth inhibitory effect of R2HBJJ , a novel muscarinic antagonist , on non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells and the possible mechanisms . The competitive binding assay revealed that R2HBJJ had a high affinity to M3 and M1 AChRs . R2HBJJ presented a strong anticholinergic activity on carbachol-induced contraction of guinea-pig trachea . R2HBJJ markedly suppressed the growth of NSCLC cells , such as H1299 , H460 and H157 . In H1299 cells , both R2HBJJ and its leading compound R2-PHC displayed significant anti-proliferative activity as M3 receptor antagonist darifenacin . Exogenous replenish of ACh could attenuate R2HBJJ-induced growth inhibition . Silencing M3 receptor or ChAT by specific-siRNAs resulted in a growth inhibition of 55.5% and 37.9% on H1299 cells 96 h post transfection , respectively . Further studies revealed that treatment with R2HBJJ arrested the cell cycle in G0/G1 by down-regulation of cyclin D1-CDK4/6-Rb . Therefore , the current study reveals that NSCLC cells express an autocrine and paracrine cholinergic system which stimulates the growth of NSCLC cells . R2HBJJ , as a novel mAChRs antagonist , can block the local cholinergic loop by antagonizing predominantly M3 receptors and inhibit NSCLC cell growth , which suggest that M3 receptor antagonist might be a potential chemotherapeutic regimen for NSCLC .
DNA repair is an essential cellular process required to maintain genomic stability . Every cell is subjected to thousands of DNA lesions daily under normal physiological conditions . Ionizing radiation ( IR ) is a major DNA damaging agent that can be produced by both natural and man-made sources . A common source of radiation exposure is through its use in medical diagnostics or treatments such as for cancer radiotherapy where relatively high doses are received by patients . To understand the detailed DNA repair gene transcription response to high dose IR , gene expression exon array studies have been performed and the response to radiation in two divergent cell types , lymphoblastoid cell lines and primary fibroblasts , has been examined . These exon arrays detect expression levels across the entire gene , and have the advantage of high sensitivity and the ability to identify alternative transcripts . We found a selection of DNA repair genes , including some not previously reported , that are modulated in response to radiation . Detailed dose and time course kinetics of DNA repair transcription was conducted and results have been validated utilizing PCR methods . Alternative transcription products in response to IR were identified in several DNA repair genes including RRM2B and XPC where alternative initiation sites were found . These investigations have advanced the knowledge about the transcriptional response of DNA repair .
Recent studies have highlighted an apparently paradoxical link between self-renewal and senescence triggered by DNA damage in certain cell types . In addition , the finding that TP53 can suppress senescence has caused a re-evaluation of its functional role in regulating these outcomes . To investigate these phenomena and their relationship to pluripotency and senescence , we examined the response of the TP53-competent embryonal carcinoma ( EC ) cell line PA1 to etoposide-induced DNA damage . Nuclear POU5F1/OCT4A and p21cip1 were upregulated in the same cells following etoposide-induced G 2M arrest . However , while accumulating in the karyosol , the amount of OCT4A was reduced in the chromatin fraction . Phosphorylated CHK2 and Rad51/gammaH2AX-positive nuclear foci , overexpression of Aurora B kinase and moderate macroautophagy were evident . Upon release from G 2M arrest , cells with repaired DNA entered mitoses , while the cells with persisting DNA damage remained at this checkpoint or underwent mitotic slippage and gradually senesced . Reduction of TP53 using sh- or si-RNA prevented the upregulation of OCT4A and p21cip1 and increased DNA damage . Subsequently , mitoses , micronucleation and senescence were all enhanced after TP53 reduction with senescence confirmed by upregulation of CDKN2A/p16ink4a and increased sa-beta-galactosidase positivity . Those mitoses enhanced by TP53 silencing were shown to be multicentrosomal and multi-polar , containing fragmented and highly deranged chromosomes , indicating a loss of genome integrity . Together , these data suggest that TP53-dependent coupling of self-renewal and senescence pathways through the DNA damage checkpoint provides a mechanism for how embryonal stem cell-like EC cells safeguard DNA integrity , genome stability and ultimately the fidelity of self-renewal .
Filamin-A cross-links actin filaments into dynamic orthogonal networks , and interacts with an array of proteins of diverse cellular functions . Because several filamin-A interaction partners are implicated in signaling of cell mobility regulation , we tested the hypothesis that filamin-A plays a role in cancer metastasis . Using four pairs of filamin-A proficient and deficient isogenic cell lines , we found that filamin-A deficiency in cancer cells significantly reduces their migration and invasion . Using a xenograft tumor model with subcutaneous and intracardiac injections of tumor cells , we found that the filamin-A deficiency causes significant reduction of lung , splenic and systemic metastasis in nude mice . We evaluated the expression of filamin-A in breast cancer tissues by immunohistochemical staining , and found that low levels of filamin-A expression in cancer cells of the tumor tissues are associated with a better distant metastasis-free survival than those with normal levels of filamin-A . These data not only validate filamin-A as a prognostic marker for cancer metastasis , but also suggest that inhibition of filamin-A in cancer cells may reduce metastasis and that filamin-A can be used as a therapeutic target for filamin-A positive cancer .
The increasing evidence supported the role of Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 ( EZH2 ) in the cancer development and progression . However , its precise role in the tumorigenesis of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma ( NPC ) remains to be elucidated . EZH2 was depleted by retroviral infection in the NPC cells ( HK-1 , CNE-2 , CNE-1 and C666-1 ) . The degree of EZH2 knockdown was then assessed by real-time quantitative PCR and Western Blot analysis . Cell proliferation was assessed using the soluble tetrazolium salt ( MTS ) cell proliferation assay , and cell cycle was measured by FACS test . The methylation status of p16(INK4a )was determined by bisulphate treatment of the DNA , followed by MSP . EZH2 was over-expressed in NPC cells , and the expression in undifferentiated-derived NPC cells ( CNE-1 , C666-1 ) was more significant than differentiated-derived NPC cells ( HK-1 , CNE-2 ) . EZH2 was successfully depleted after retroviral infection in C666-1 cells , and the EZH2 depletion could inhibit the proliferation and arrested G1/S phase of NPC cells . In addition , both mRNA and protein levels of p16(INK4a) increased significantly in presence of EZH2 depletion . The further Methylation-Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction ( MSP ) assay suggested that over-expressed EZH2 may contribute to the reduction of p16(INK4a) expression by hyper methylating its promoter . EZH2 is overexpressed in NPC and reduces expression of p16(INK4a) by influencing methylation , opening therapeutic options .
Cell invasion is required for neoplastic metastasis . Matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , which degrades the extracellular matrix , is a major component in the process of cancer cell invasion . Sulfuretin is one of the major flavonoids isolated from Rhus verniciflua . Sulfuretin has been used to reduce oxidative stress , platelet aggregation , the inflammatory response and mutagenesis . However , the effect of sulfuretin on breast cancer metastasis is unknown . In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effect of sulfuretin on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion in MCF-7 cells . Sulfuretin inhibited TPA-induced transcriptional activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB ( NF-\u03baB ) . We demonstrated that sulfuretin mediated the inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and that cell invasion in MCF-7 cells involved suppression of the NF-\u03baB pathway . Therefore , inhibiting MMP-9 expression by sulfuretin may have therapeutic potential for controlling breast cancer invasiveness .
OBJECTIVE In addition to its effects on cholesterol levels , apoE3 has lipid-independent effects that contribute to cardiovascular protection ; one of these effects is the ability to inhibit cell cycling in VSMCs . The goal of this study was to identify and characterize cell cycle-regulatory mechanisms responsible for the anti-mitogenic effect of apoE . METHODS AND RESULTS Primary VSMCs were stimulated with serum in the absence or presence of apoE3. apoE3 upregulated expression of the cdk inhibitor , p27(kip1) , in primary VSMCs , and this effect required Cox2 and activation of PGI(2)-IP signaling . The microRNA family , miR221/222 has recently been identified as a post-translational regulator of p27 , and apoE3 inhibited miR221/222 expression in a Cox2- and PGI(2)/IP-dependent manner . Moreover , reconstituted miR222 expression was sufficient to override the effects of apoE on p27 expression and S phase entry . The ability to repress expression of miR221/222 is shared by apoE3-containing HDL but is absent from apoA-1 , LDL and apoE-depleted HDL . All three apoE isoforms regulate miR221/222 , and the effect is independent of the C-terminal lipid-binding domain. miR221/222 levels are increased in the aortae of apoE3-null mice and reduced when apoE3 expression is reconstituted by adeno-associated virus infection . Thus , regulation of miR221/222 by apoE3 occurs invivo as well as invitro . CONCLUSIONS ApoE inhibits VSMC proliferation by regulating p27 through miR221/222 . Control of cell cycle-regulatory microRNAs adds a new dimension to the spectrum of cardiovascular protective effects afforded by apoE and apoE-HDL .
Ovarian cancer , one of inflammation-associated cancers , is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women . Inflammation in the tumor microenvironment is associated with peritoneal tumor dissemination and massive ascites , which contribute to high mortality in ovarian cancer . Tumor suppressor p53 is frequently deleted or mutated in aggressive and high-grade ovarian cancer , probably aggravating cancer progression and increasing mortality . We therefore investigated the influence of p53 on proinflammatory chemokines in ovarian cancer cells . A PCR array of the chemokine network revealed that ovarian cancer cells with low or mutated p53 expression expressed high levels of proinflammatory chemokines such as CXCL1 , 2 , 3 and 8 . Transient transfection of p53 into p53-null ovarian cancer cells downregulated proinflammatory chemokines induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF ) , a proinflammatory cytokine abundantly expressed in ovarian cancer . Furthermore , p53 restoration or stabilization blocked TNF-induced NF-kappaB promoter activity and reduced TNF-activated IkappaB . Restoration of p53 increased ubiquitination of IkappaB , resulting from concurrently reduced proteasome activity followed by stability of IkappaB . A ubiquitination PCR array on restoration of p53 did not reveal any significant change in expression except for Mdm2 , indicating that the balance between p53 and Mdm2 is more important in regulating NF-kappaB signaling rather than the direct effect of p53 on ubiquitin-related genes or IkappaB kinases . In addition , nutlin-3 , a specific inducer of p53 stabilization , inhibited proinflammatory chemokines by reducing TNF-activated IkappaB through p53 stabilization . Taken together , these results suggest that p53 inhibits proinflammatory chemokines in ovarian cancer cells by reducing proteasomal degradation of IkappaB . Thus , frequent loss or mutation of p53 may promote tumor progression by enhancing inflammation in the tumor microenvironment .
Approximately half of all HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer patients do not respond to trastuzumab-containing therapy . Therefore , there remains an urgent and unmet clinical need for the development of predictive biomarkers for trastuzumab response . Recently , several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the inflammatory tumor microenvironment is a major contributor to therapy resistance in breast cancer . In order to explore the predictive value of inflammation in breast cancer patients , we measured the inflammatory biomarkers serum ferritin and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) in 66 patients immediately before undergoing trastuzumab-containing therapy and evaluated their progression-free and overall survival . The elevation in pre-treatment serum ferritin ( >250 ng/ml ) or CRP ( >7.25 mg/l ) was a significant predictor of reduced progression-free survival and shorter overall survival . When patients were stratified based on their serum ferritin and CRP levels , patients with elevation in both inflammatory biomarkers had a markedly poorer response to trastuzumab-containing therapy . Therefore , the elevation in inflammatory serum biomarkers may reflect a pathological state that decreases the clinical efficacy of this therapy . Anti-inflammatory drugs and life-style changes to decrease inflammation in cancer patients should be explored as possible strategies to sensitize patients to anti-cancer therapeutics .
Nuclear factor kappa-B ( NF-kappaB ) activates multiple genes with overlapping roles in cell proliferation , inflammation and cancer . Using an unbiased approach we identified human CDK6 as a novel kinase phosphorylating NF-kappaB p65 at serine 536 . Purified and reconstituted CDK6/cyclin complexes phosphorylated p65 in vitro and in transfected cells . The physiological role of CDK6 for basal as well as cytokine-induced p65 phosphorylation or NF-kappaB activation was revealed upon RNAi-mediated suppression of CDK6 . Inhibition of CDK6 catalytic activity by PD332991 suppressed activation of NF-kappaB and TNF-induced gene expression . In complex with a constitutively active viral cyclin CDK6 stimulated NF-kappaB p65-mediated transcription in a target gene specific manner and this effect was partially dependent on its ability to phosphorylate p65 at serine 536 . Tumor formation in thymi and spleens of v-cyclin transgenic mice correlated with increased levels of p65 Ser536 phosphorylation , increased expression of CDK6 and upregulaton of the NF-kappaB target cyclin D3 . These results suggest that aberrant CDK6 expression or activation that is frequently observed in human tumors can contribute through NF-kappaB to chronic inflammation and neoplasia .
Background and Objective . The cell cycle is regulated by proteins at different checkpoints , and dysregulation of this cycle plays a role in carcinogenesis . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are enzymes that degrade collagen and promote tumour infiltration . The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of various cell cycle regulators and MMPs and to correlate such expression with progression and recurrence in patients with stage T1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder ( UCB ) . Patients and Methods . This population-based cohort study comprised 201 well-characterized patients with primary stage T1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder . Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed material to quantify expression of cell cycle regulators and two MMPs . Results . Normal expression of p53 and abnormal expression of MMP9 were associated with greater risk of tumour recurrence . Also , normal p16 expression was related to a lower risk of tumour progression . MMP2 , p21 , cyclin D1 , and pRb showed no significant results that could estimate progression or recurrence . Conclusions . Normal p16 expression is associated with a lower risk of tumour progression , but immunohistochemistry on cell cycle regulators and MMPs has little value in predicting the prognosis in stage T1 UCB .
OBJECTIVE The aim of this retrospective study is to analyze the clinical and pathological factors related to the prognosis of Chinese patients with stage Ib to IIb cervical cancer . METHODS AND RESULTS 13 clinical pathological factors in 255 patients with stage Ib to IIb cervical cancer undergoing radical hysterectomy and systematic lymphadenectomy were analyzed to screen for factors related to prognosis . The cumulative 5-year survival of the 255 patients was 75.7% . The result of the univariate analysis suggested that clinical stage , cell differentiation , depth of cervical stromal invasion , parametrial tissue involvement , and lymph node metastasis were prognostic factors for patients with stage Ib to IIb cervical cancer ( P<0.05 ) . Compared with cases with involvement of iliac nodes , obturator nodes , or inguinal lymph nodes , cases with metastasis to the common iliac lymph nodes had a poorer prognosis ( P<0.05 ) . Cases with involvement of four or more lymph nodes had a poorer prognosis than those with involvement of three or fewer lymph nodes ( P<0.05 ) . Using multivariate Cox proportional hazards model regression analysis , non-squamous histological type , poor differentiation , parametrial tissue involvement , and outer 1/3 stromal invasion were found to be independently related to patients poor prognosis ( P<0.05 ) . CONCLUSION Non-squamous histological type , poor cell differentiation , parametrial tissue involvement , and outer 1/3 stromal invasion are the independent poor prognostic factors for patients with stage Ib to IIb cervical cancer .
Family with sequence similarity 189 , member B ( FAM189B ) , alias COTE1 , a putative oncogene selected by microarray , for the first time was here found to be significantly up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) specimens and HCC cell lines. mRNA expression of COTE1 in HCC samples and cell lines was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and real-time PCR , while protein expression of COTE1 in HCC tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry . In addition , invasion of HCC cells was observed after overexpressing or silencing COTE1 . In the total of 48 paired HCC specimens , compared with the adjacent non-cancer tissues , the expression of COTE1 was up-regulated in 31 ( p<0.01 ) . In HCC cell lines , COTE1 expression was significantly higher than in normal human adult liver ( p<0.01 ) . Overexpression of COTE1 enhanced HCC-derived LM6 and MHCC-L cellular invasion in vitro . In contrast , COTE1 knockdown via RNAi markedly suppressed these phenotypes , as documented in LM3 and MHCC-H HCC cells . Mechanistic analyses indicated that COTE1 could physically associate with WW domain oxidoreductase ( WWOX ) , a tumor suppressor . COTE1 may be closely correlated with invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells and thus may serve as an effective target for gene therapy .
Momordica charantia has been found to exhibit anticancer activity , in addition to its well-known therapeutic functions . We have demonstrated that the leaf extract of Momordica charantia ( MCME ) induces apoptosis in several human cancer cells through caspase- and mitochondria-dependent pathways . In this study , a different susceptibility to MCME was found in human lung adenocarcinoma CL1 cells with different metastatic ability , leading to the significant difference of cell viability and invasiveness between MCME-treated CL1-0 and CL1-5 cells . MCME was found to upregulate the expression of Wnt-2 and affect the migratory and invasive ability of CL1 cells through suppressed MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzymatic activities . We proposed that MCME mediates inhibition against migration of CL1 cells by reducing the expression and activation of Src and FAK to decrease the expression of downstream Akt , beta-catenin , and MMPs .
OBJECTIVE The signalling molecule protein kinase B ( Akt ) modulates many cellular processes . Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K)/Akt signalling pathways play important roles in tumour angiogenesis . The aim of this study was to determine the role of phosphorylated Akt ( pAkt ) in angiogenesis and its correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A in gastric adenocarcinoma . METHODS Tumour tissue and matched healthy gastric mucosa were obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection of gastric adenocarcinoma . Akt and pAkt were detected via Western blotting . VEGF-A , pAkt and CD34 were examined by immunohistochemistry . RESULTS Akt and pAkt protein levels were significantly higher in gastric cancer tissue than in normal tissue ( n = 48 patients ) . Positive VEGF-A immunostaining was significantly associated with pAkt immunostaining . Microvessel density was correlated with both VEGF-A and pAkt positivity . CONCLUSIONS Phosphorylated Akt and VEGF-A are involved in angiogenesis of gastric adenocarcinoma , and Akt activation may contribute to angiogenesis via VEGF-A upregulation . The PI3K/Akt/VEGF signalling pathway may be involved in gastric adeno carcinoma .
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a critical process providing tumor cells with the ability to migrate and escape from the primary tumor and metastasize to distant sites . Recently , EMT was shown to be associated with the cancer stem cell ( CSC ) phenotype in breast cancer . Snail is a transcription factor that mediates EMT in a number of tumor types , including colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . Our study was done to determine the role of Snail in mediating EMT and CSC function in CRC . Human CRC specimens were stained for Snail expression , and human CRC cell lines were transduced with a retroviral Snail construct or vector control . Cell proliferation and chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin of the infected cells were determined by the MTT ( colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ) assay . Migration and invasion were determined in vitro using modified Boyden chamber assays . EMT and putative CSC markers were analyzed using Western blotting . Intravenous injection of tumor cells was done to evaluate their metastatic potential in mice . Snail was overexpressed in human CRC surgical specimens . This overexpression induced EMT and a CSC-like phenotype in human CRC cells and enhanced cell migration and invasion ( P < 0.002 vs. control ) . Snail overexpression also led to an increase in metastasis formation in vivo ( P < 0.002 vs. control ) . Furthermore , the Snail-overexpressing CRC cells were more chemoresistant to oxaliplatin than control cells . Increased Snail expression induces EMT and the CSC-like phenotype in CRC cells , which enhance cancer cell invasion and chemoresistance . Thus , Snail is a potential therapeutic target in metastatic CRC .
The Hippo signaling pathway inhibits cell growth and regulates organ size through a kinase cascade that leads to the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the growth-promoting transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein ( YAP)/Yorkie . It mediates contact inhibition of cell growth downstream of cadherin adhesion molecules and other cell surface proteins . Contact inhibition is often antagonized by mitogenic growth factor signaling . We report an important mechanism for this antagonism , inhibition of Hippo pathway signaling by mitogenic growth factors . EGF treatment of immortalized mammary cells triggers the rapid translocation of YAP into the nucleus along with YAP dephosphorylation , both of which depend on Lats , the terminal kinase in the Hippo pathway . A small-molecule inhibitor screen of downstream effector pathways shows that EGF receptor inhibits the Hippo pathway through activation of PI3-kinase ( PI3K ) and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase ( PDK1 ) , but independent of AKT activity . The PI3K-PDK1 pathway also mediates YAP nuclear translocation downstream of lysophosphatidic acid and serum as a result of constitutive oncogenic activation of PI3K . PDK1 associates with the core Hippo pathway-kinase complex through the scaffold protein Salvador . The entire Hippo core complex dissociates in response to EGF signaling in a PI3K-PDK1-dependent manner , leading to inactivation of Lats , dephosphorylation of YAP , and YAP nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activation of its target gene , CTGF . These findings show that an important activity of mitogenic signaling pathways is to inactivate the growth-inhibitory Hippo pathway and provide a mechanism for antagonism between contact inhibition and growth factor action .
OBJECTIVE To observe the anti-tumor recurrent and metastatic efficacy of Ru'ai Shuhou Recipe ( RSR ) on HER2 positive breast cancer , to evaluate the effects of RSR on the expressions of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) in the recurrence and metastasis of HER2 positive breast cancer , thus revealing its anti-tumor recurrent and metastatic mechanisms . METHODS Selected were 30-week-old HER2/neu transgenic spontaneous breast cancer mice FVB/neu . The primary tumor resection was carried out . After surgery they were randomly divided into the blank control group , the RSR group , the Herceptin group , and the combination group ( RSR + Herceptin group ) . The treatment lasted for 4 months . The inhibition rate of the recurrent tumor volume and the inhibition rate of the lung metastasis were evaluated . The expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2 ) , matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase ( TIMP-1 ) , and TIMP-2 in the recurrent tumor tissue were detected using Western blot . RESULTS By the end of the treatment the average recurrent tumor volume was 11.11 +/- 8.71 cm3 in the blank control group and 5.56 +/- 5.55 cm3 of the RSR group , showing statistical difference between the two groups ( P = 0.037 ) . The average lung metastatic nodule was 16 in the blank control group and 10 in the RSR group . The inhibition rate of lung metastasis was 37. 85% in the RSR group , but with no statistical significance . The expression level of activated MMP-2 in the RSR group was down-regulated when compared with the blank control group , the Herceptin group , and the combination group ( P < 0.05 ) . The expression of MMP-9 of the RSR group , the Herceptin group , and the combination group was significantly down-regulated when compared with the blank control group ( P < 0.05 ) . The expression of MMP-9 of the RSR group and the combination group was further down-regulated when compared with the Herceptin group ( P < 0.05 ) . The expressions of both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 of the RSR group , the Herceptin group , and the combination group were all up-regulated when compared with the blank control group ( P < 0.05 ) . The increased expression of TIMP-1 was more significantly in the RSR group and the combination group when compared with the Herceptin group ( P < 0.05 ) . It was higher in the combination group than in the RSR group ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS RSR could inhibit the tumor recurrence of FVB/neu mice . It could reduce the degradation of extracellular matrix and increase the protective effects of extracellular matrix . It might achieve its anti-tumor effect through effecting the invasive and metastatic capabilities of breast tumor cells .
UNLABELLED BACKGROUND Cell lines are very useful for clinical and basic research . Thus far , only 11 reports have documented the characteristics of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell lines in the literature . Due to the scarcity of information , the establishment of an ovarian malignant tumor cell line with distinctive characteristics is particularly important to study this disease . Thus , this study was undertaken to establish and characterize a new human endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell line of the ovary . METHODS The cell line NOMH-1 was established from an ovarian tumor of a 44-year-old woman . Features of the cell line studied included morphology , chromosome analysis , heterotransplantation , tumor markers , and chemosensitivity . RESULTS This cell line has been growing well for 232 months and subcultured more than 50 times . Monolayer cultured cells were polygonal in shape , showing a pavement-like arrangement and a tendency to stack without contact inhibition . They exhibited a human karyotype with a modal chromosomal number in the hypertriploid range . The cells could be transplanted into the subcutis of nude mice and produced tumors resembling the original tumor . NOMH-1 cells expressed both CEA and CA19-9 which were identified immunohistochemically in the original tumor and the heterotransplanted tumor . The cells were sensitive to paclitaxel , an agent commonly used in the treatment of gynecological cancers . CONCLUSIONS NOMH-1 is the first ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell line in which CEA and CA19-9 expression have been defined . This newly established cell line should be useful for investigating the characteristics of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma .
OBJECTIVE This study describes a new method used in the clinical laboratory at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein to detect mutations in exons 8 and 17 of the KIT gene in patients with acute myeloid leukemia . METHODS Genomic DNA extraction was performed on 54 samples of peripheral blood or bone marrow from patients with acute myeloid leukemia . The extracted DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced , and the fragments were analyzed . RESULTS Within the analyzed samples , we detected four mutations in exon 8 , two mutations in exon 17 , and mutations or a double mutation in one sample . CONCLUSION The tests detecting mutations in exon 8 and 17 on the KIT gene were successfully standardized . The test is now included among the routine diagnostics employed for patients at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein clinical laboratory .
Disruption of contact inhibition and serum afflux that occur after a tissue injury activate cell cycle , which then stops when confluence is reached again . Although the events involved in cell cycle entry have been widely documented , those managing cell cycle exit have remained so far ill defined . We have identified that the final stage of wound closure is preceded in keratinocytes by a strong accumulation of miR-483-3p , which acts as a mandatory signal triggering cell cycle arrest when confluence is reached . Blocking miR-483-3p accumulation strongly delays cell cycle exit , maintains cells into a proliferative state and retards their differentiation program . Using two models of cell cycle synchronization ( i.e. mechanical injury and serum addition ) , we show that an ectopic upregulation of miR-483-3p blocks cell cycle progression in early G1 phase . This arrest results from a direct targeting of the CDC25A phosphatase by miR-483-3p , which can be impeded using an anti-miRNA against miR-483-3p or a protector that blocks the complex formation between miR-483-3p and the 3'-untranslated region ( UTR ) of CDC25A transcript . We show that the miRNA-induced silencing of CDC25A increases the tyrosine phosphorylation status of CDK4/6 cyclin-dependent kinases which , in turn , abolishes CDK4/6 capacity to associate with D-type cyclins . This prevents CDK4/6 kinases ' activation , impairs downstream events such as cyclin E stimulation and sequesters cells in early G1 . We propose this new regulatory process of cyclin-CDK association as a general mechanism coupling miRNA-mediated CDC25A invalidation to CDK post-transcriptional modifications and cell cycle control .
The aim of the present study was to isolate endothelial cells from tooth buds ( unerupted deciduous teeth ) of miniature swine . Mandibular molar tooth buds harvested from swine fetuses at fetal days90-110 were cultured in growth medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum in 100-mm culture dishes until the primary cells outgrown from the tooth buds reached confluence . A morphologically defined set of pavement-shaped primary cells were picked up manually with filter paper containing trypsin/ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid solution and transferred to a separate dish . A characterization of the cellular characteristics and a functional analysis of the cultured cells at passages 3 to 5 were performed using immunofluorescence , a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay , a tube formation assay , and transmission electron microscopy . The isolated cells grew in a pavement arrangement and showed the characteristics of contact inhibition upon reaching confluence . The population doubling time was at passage 3 . As shown by immunocytostaining and western blotting with specific antibodies , the cells produced the endothelial marker proteins such as vascular endothelial cadherin , von Willebrand factor , and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 . Observation with time-lapse images showed that small groups of cells aggregated and adhered to each other to form tube-like structures . Moreover , as revealed through transmission electron microscopy , these adherent cells had formed junctional complexes . These endothelial cells from the tooth buds of miniature swine are available as cell lines for studies on tube formation and use in regenerative medical science .
Systemic oxidative stress is associated with a wide range of pathological conditions . Oxidative DNA damage is frequently measured in circulating lymphocytes . Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) is known to be more sensitive to oxidative damage than nuclear DNA but is rarely used for direct measurement of DNA damage in clinical studies . Based on the supercoiling-sensitive real-time PCR method , we propose a new approach for the noninvasive monitoring of systemic oxidative stress by quantifying the mtDNA structural damage and copy number change in isolated lymphocytes in a single test . We show that lymphocytes have significantly less mtDNA content and relatively lower baseline levels of damage than cancer cell lines . In an ex vivo challenge experiment , we demonstrate , for the first time , that exogenous H2O2 induces a significant increase in mtDNA damage in lymphocytes from healthy individuals , but no repair activity is observed after 1 h recovery . We further demonstrate that whole blood may serve as a convenient alternative to the isolated lymphocytes in mtDNA analysis . Thus , the blood analysis with the multiple mtDNA end-points proposed in the current study may provide a simple and sensitive test to interrogate the nature and extent of systemic oxidative stress for a broad spectrum of clinical investigations .
OBJECTIVE To investigate the expression profiles of serum Golgi protein-73 ( GP73 ) in liver cirrhosis and primary hepatic carcinoma ( PHC ) and determine its clinical value for differential diagnosis . METHODS Serum protein expressions of GP73 and alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP ) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and chemiluminescence assay , respectively , in patients with PHC ( n=80 ) , liver cirrhosis ( n=65 ) , and healthy controls ( n=50 ) . Inter-group changes were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test , and significance of these differences was assessed by Mann- Whitney test . A receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve was plotted to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency and determine the cut-off values for GP73 and AFP . Sensitivity and specificity were compared by the Chi-squared test . Correlation between serum GP73 expression and clinical parameters was determined by Spearman's rank correlation analysis . RESULTS The PHC group showed significantly higher serum GP73 ( 282.0 mug/L ) than the liver cirrhosis group ( 211.8 mug/L ) and control group ( 58.3 mug/L ) ( H = 93.30 , P less than 0.01 ) . For differential diagnosis of PHC and liver cirrhosis , the cut-off value was 318.1 mug/L for GP73 and 13.4 mug/L for AFP . Sensitivity of GP73 was lower than AFP ( 45% ( 36/80 ) vs. 65% ( 52/80 ) ; X2 = 8.02 , P less than 0.05 ) . Specificity of GP73 was lower than AFP but no significance was found ( 83.1% ( 54/65 ) vs. 87.7% ( 57/65 ) ; X2=0.27 , P more than 0.05 ) . The areas under the ROC curves were not significantly different between GP73 and AFP ( 0.65 ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.54 vs. 0.75 ( 95% CI : 0.67 Z = 1.88 , P more than 0.05 ) . The area under the ROC curves increased but not significantly ( 0.80 ( 95% CI : 0.73 vs. 0.75 ( 95% CI : 0.67 Z=2.61 , P more than 0.05 ) . Serum GP73 was correlated with liver cirrhosis ( r=0.27 ) , vascular invasion ( r=0.29 ) , and TNM staging ( r=0.27 ) ( all P less than 0.05 ) , but not with sex ( r=0.13 ) , age ( r=0.10 ) , enhanced AFP ( > 13.4 mug/L ; r=0.03 ) , tumor size ( r=0.18 ) , or distant metastasis ( r=0.04 ) , all P less than 0.05 . CONCLUSION Serum GP73 and AFP have comparable diagnostic efficiency , but the sensitivity of AFP is superior for differential diagnosis of liver cirrhosis and primary hepatic carcinoma . Elevated serum GP73 may be correlated with liver tumor load and aggressiveness .
Within the family of protein kinase C ( PKC ) molecules , the novel isoform PRKCE ( PKCepsilon ) acts as a bona fide oncogene in in vitro and in vivo models of tumorigenesis . Previous studies have reported expression of PKCepsilon in breast , prostate and lung tumors above that of normal adjacent tissue . Data from the cancer genome atlas suggest increased copy number of PRKCE in triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . We find that overexpression of PKCepsilon in a non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line is sufficient to overcome contact inhibition and results in the formation of cellular foci . Correspondingly , inhibition of PKCepsilon in a TNBC cell model results in growth defects in two-dimensional ( 2D ) and three-dimensional ( 3D ) culture conditions and orthotopic xenografts . Using stable isotope labeling of amino acids in a cell culture phosphoproteomic approach , we find that CTNND1/p120ctn phosphorylation at serine 268 ( P-S268 ) occurs in a strictly PKCepsilon-dependent manner , and that loss of PKCepsilon signaling in TNBC cells leads to reversal of mesenchymal morphology and signaling . In a model of Ras activation , inhibition of PKCepsilon is sufficient to block mesenchymal cell morphology . Finally , treatment with a PKCepsilon ATP mimetic inhibitor , PF-5263555 , recapitulates genetic loss of function experiments impairing p120ctn phosphorylation as well as compromising TNBC cell growth in vitro and in vivo . We demonstrate PKCepsilon as a tractable therapeutic target for TNBC , where p120ctn phosphorylation may serve as a readout for monitoring patient response.Oncogene advance online publication , 1 April 2013 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.91 .
Chronic alcohol ingestion increases hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 ( CYP2E1 ) , which is associated with hepatocarcinogenesis . We investigated whether treatment with chlormethiazole ( CMZ ) , a CYP2E1 inhibitor , protects against alcohol-associated hepatic carcinogenesis in rats . Rats were fed either an ethanol liquid diet or a non-ethanol liquid diet , with or without CMZ for one and ten months . A single intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine ( DEN , 20 mg/kg ) was given to initiate hepatic carcinogenesis . CYP2E1 expression , inflammatory proteins , cell proliferation , protein-bound 4-HNE , etheno-DNA adducts , 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) , retinoid concentrations , and hepatic carcinogenesis were examined . Ethanol feeding for 1 month with DEN resulted in significantly increased hepatic CYP2E1 levels and increased nuclear accumulation of NF-\u03baB protein and TNF-\u03b1 expression , which were associated with increased cyclin D1 expression and p-GST positive altered hepatic foci . All of these changes induced by ethanol feeding were significantly inhibited by the one month CMZ treatment . At 10-months of treatment , hepatocellular adenomas were detected in ethanol-fed rats only , but neither in control rats nor in animals receiving ethanol and CMZ . The 8-OHdG formation was found to be significantly increased in ethanol fed animals and normalized with CMZ treatment . In addition , alcohol-reduced hepatic retinol and retinoic acid concentrations were restored by CMZ treatment to normal levels in the rats at 10 months of treatment . These data demonstrate that the inhibition of ethanol-induced CYP2E1 as a key pathogenic factor can counteract the tumor-promoting action of ethanol by decreasing TNF-\u03b1 expression , NF-\u03baB activation , and oxidative DNA damage as well as restoring normal hepatic levels of retinoic acid in DEN-treated rats .
Cell migration plays important roles in natural processes involving embryonic development , inflammation , wound healing , cancer metastasis and angiogenesis . Cell migration on various biomaterials is also believed to improve the rate of wound healing and implant therapies in the tissue-engineering field . This study measured the distance traversed , or mileage , of mouse fibroblasts on a silk fibroin surface . Fibroblasts on the fibroin surface moved with better progress during 24 h than cells on collagen or fibronectin surfaces . Results obtained by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) revealed that fibroblasts on the fibroin surface expressed transforming growth factor \u03b2-induced protein ( TGFBI ) , which is an extracellular matrix ( ECM ) protein , stronger than on other surfaces in the early cell-culture stages . These results demonstrate that the fibroin surface shows higher potential to enhance cell migration and the production of ECM than a collagen or fibronectin surface .
BACKGROUND Angiogenesis is an essential process in cancer growth maintenance , and metastasis . Angiopoietin-2 promotes tumor angiogenesis by priming the vasculature and potentiating the effects of cytokines at the front of active neovascularization . Enhanced expression of angiopoietin-2 has been reported in lung cancer tissue . Survivin is one of the inhibitors of apoptosis protein that has been shown to play a key role in cancer progression , and in tumor angiogenesis . Also plays a key role in tumor cell resistance to anticancer agents and ionizing radiation . AIM To measure the serum levels of angiopoietin-2 and survivin as possible angiogenic factors in lung cancer patients with the assessment of their interrelationships and clinical significance . PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with lung cancer as NSCLC ( n=70 ) and healthy volunteers ( n=10 ) were enrolled . Serum angiopoietin-2 and survivin concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELIZA ) . RESULTS Median serum angiopoietin-2 levels with lung cancer ( 2730pg/mL ) ranged from 1171 to 6541pg/mL was higher than the median of the control group ( 1795pg/mL ) ranged from 1076 to 2730/mL , p<0.001 . Median serum survivin levels were also higher in patients with lung cancer ( 53.0pg/mL ) ranged from 39.3 to 96.3pg/mL than the median of the control group ( 48.8pg/mL ) ranged from 38.0 to 74.6pg/mL , but did not reach statistical significance p=0.206 . In all patients with lung cancer , serum angiopoietin-2 was not significantly correlated with survivin ( r=0.073 , p=0.657 ) . Neither serum angiopoietin-2 nor survivin showed significant relation with the serum angiopoietin-2 or survivin levels depending on the cell types , stage progression , and metastasis among the patients with NSCLC . CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that serum angiopoietin-2 is a useful marker for the diagnosis of NSCLC by ELIZA technique .
Understanding how arsenic exacts its diverse , global disease burden is hampered by a limited understanding of the particular biological pathways that are disrupted by arsenic and underlie pathogenesis . A reductionist view would predict that a small number of basic pathways are generally perturbed by arsenic , and manifest as diverse diseases . Following an initial observation that arsenite-exposed cells in culture acidify their media more rapidly than control cells , the report here shows that low level exposure to arsenite ( 75ppb ) is sufficient to induce aerobic glycolysis ( the Warburg effect ) as a generalized phenomenon in cultured human primary cells and cell lines . Expanded studies in one such cell line , the non-malignant pulmonary epithelial line , BEAS-2B , established that the arsenite-induced Warburg effect was associated with increased accumulation of intracellular and extracellular lactate , an increased rate of extracellular acidification , and inhibition by the non-metabolized glucose analog , 2-deoxy-D-glucose . Associated with the induction of aerobic glycolysis was a pathway-wide induction of glycolysis gene expression , as well as protein accumulation of an established glycolysis master-regulator , hypoxia-inducible factor 1A . Arsenite-induced alteration of energy production in human cells represents the type of fundamental perturbation that could extend to many tissue targets and diseases .
The current study was undertaken to study the effect of a macerated extract of Nigella sativa seeds in normal as well as in tumour bearing mice against gamma radiation-induced cellular damage to normal tissues . This was done to mimic the clinical setting where in , normal tissues of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy are exposed to the deleterious effects of radiation . The protection of cellular DNA was analysed in peripheral blood leucocytes of whole body irradiated mice following pretreatment with macerated extract of Nigella sativa seeds ( 100 mg/kg ) , using alkaline comet assay , and also estimating biochemical and blood parameters such as levels of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase , thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and protein oxidation in organs such as spleen , liver , brain and intestine haemoglobin and total leucocyte count , respectively . The results showed that the macerated extract of Nigella sativa seeds protected the liver , spleen , brain and intestines both in normal as well as tumour bearing mice . This study concludes that macerated extract of Nigella sativa seeds has protective effects against radiation-induced damage and biochemical alterations which could be attributed to the ability to scavenge free radicals and its antioxidant properties . Hence macerated extract of Nigella sativa seeds , could be used in combination with radiation to protect against oxidative stress in normal tissues and improving the quality of life of cancer patients by mitigating unwanted side effects of radiation in normal tissues .
BACKGROUND In this paper we propose a chemical physics mechanism for the initiation of the glycolytic switch commonly known as the Warburg hypothesis , whereby glycolytic activity terminating in lactate continues even in well-oxygenated cells . We show that this may result in cancer via mitotic failure , recasting the current conception of the Warburg effect as a metabolic dysregulation consequent to cancer , to a biophysical defect that may contribute to cancer initiation . MODEL Our model is based on analogs of thermodynamic concepts that tie non-equilibrium fluid dynamics ultimately to metabolic imbalance , disrupted microtubule dynamics , and finally , genomic instability , from which cancers can arise . Specifically , we discuss how an analog of non-equilibrium Rayleigh-Benard convection can result in glycolytic oscillations and cause a cell to become locked into a higher-entropy state characteristic of cancer . CONCLUSIONS A quantitative model is presented that attributes the well-known Warburg effect to a biophysical mechanism driven by a convective disturbance in the cell . Contrary to current understanding , this effect may precipitate cancer development , rather than follow from it , providing new insights into carcinogenesis , cancer treatment , and prevention .
The green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) is the most commonly used reporter protein for monitoring gene expression and protein localization in a variety of living and fixed cells , including not only prokaryotes , but also eukaryotes , e.g. , yeasts , mammals , plants and fish . In general , it is thought that GFP is nontoxic to cells , although there are some reports on the side effect of GFP . Further , details of the molecular mechanism concerning the side effect of GFP remain unclear . Here we show that Ku80 , but not XRCC4 , plays an important role in the mechanism of the resistance to cytotoxicity induced by enhanced GFP ( EGFP ) . EGFP inhibited both cell proliferation and colony formation , and induced cell death in Ku80-deficient hamster cells , i.e. , xrs-6 cells . In addition , Ku80 attenuated EGFP-induced cytotoxicity in the xrs-6 cells . No EGFP-induced cytotoxicity was observed in the NHEJ core protein XRCC4-deficient hamster cells , i.e. , XR-1 cells . Furthermore , EGFP markedly enhanced X-ray-induced cytotoxicity in the xrs-6 cells . These results suggest that Ku80 plays a key role in the novel NHEJ-independent defense mechanism against EGFP-induced cytotoxicity . Caution should be taken in considering of the potential influence by the stress response mechanism , namely , the Ku80-dependent elimination mechanism of EGFP-induced cytotoxicity , being activated , even when using EGFP-expressing cells in which Ku80 functions normally .
Cellular senescence , an irreversible cell cycle arrest induced by a diversity of stimuli , has been considered as an innate tumor suppressing mechanism with implications and applications in cancer therapy . Using a targeted proteomics approach , we show that fibroblasts induced into senescence by expression of oncogenic Ras exhibit a decrease of global acetylation on all core histones , consistent with formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci . We also detected clear increases in repressive markers ( e.g. >50% elevation of H3K27me2/3 ) along with decreases in histone marks associated with increased transcriptional expression/elongation ( e.g . H3K36me2/3 ) . Despite the increases in repressive marks of chromatin , 179 loci ( of 2206 total ) were found to be upregulated by global quantitative proteomics . The changes in the cytosolic proteome indicated an upregulation of mitochondrial proteins and downregulation of proteins involved in glycolysis . These alterations in primary metabolism are opposite to the well-known Warburg effect observed in cancer cells . This study significantly improves our understanding of stress-induced senescence and provides a potential application for triggering it in antiproliferative strategies that target the primary metabolism in cancer cells .
BACKGROUND Matrix metalloproteinases comprise a family of enzyme degrade components of extra cellular matrix . There are single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter regions of several genes with ability to influence cancer susceptibility . The aim of this study was to analyze association between MMP3 promoter polymorphisms and colorectal cancer occurrence and progression . MATERIALS AND METHODS In this case-control study 120 colorectal cancer patients and 100 controls were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) on the genomic deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . The patients group was divided into different subgroups : a subgroup without metastatic activity ( M(-) ) and a subgroup that had developed metastasis ( M(+) ) . RESULTS There was a significant difference in frequency of the MMP-3 genotype between cases and controls ( \u03c7\u0382 = 16.17 ; P = 0.0003 ) . The 5A homozygote in patients and controls was significantly different . The frequency of the 5A allele among affected patients ( 67.91% ) was significantly higher than among the healthy controls ( 49% ; \u03c7(2) = 16.17 , P = 0.00005 ) . At the time of diagnosis , individual who was carrying the 5A allele was more represented in the M(+) subgroup than in M(-) subgroup ( chi(2) = 7.49 ; P = 0.006 , OR = 3.86 ; 95% CI , 1.43-10.33 ) . The difference between M(-) and controls did not observe statistically significant ( chi(2) = 0.009 ; P = 0.92 ) . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the presence of 5A polymorphism at the MMP-3 promoter region may favor the growth and the metastasis process in colorectal cancer patients and could be looked at as a risk factor for a worse prognosis .
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) plays a critical role in reprogramming cancer metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis ( i.e. , the Warburg effect ) , which is critical to supplying cancer cells with the biomass needed for proliferation . Previous studies have shown that cetuximab , an EGF receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody , downregulates the alpha subunit of HIF-1 ( HIF-1\u03b1 ) through the inhibition of EGF receptor downstream cell signaling and that downregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 is required for cetuximab-induced antiproliferative effects . However , the mechanism underlying these actions has yet to be identified . In this study , we used the Seahorse XF96 extracellular flux analyzer to assess the effect of cetuximab treatment on changes in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration , the two major energy-producing pathways , in live cells . We found that cetuximab downregulated lactate dehydrogenase A ( LDH-A ) and inhibited glycolysis in cetuximab-sensitive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) cells in an HIF-1\u03b1 downregulation-dependent manner . HNSCC cells with acquired cetuximab resistance expressed a high level of HIF-1\u03b1 and were highly glycolytic . Overexpression of a HIF-1\u03b1 mutant ( HIF-1\u03b1/\u0394ODD ) conferred resistance to cetuximab-induced G1 phase cell-cycle arrest , which could be overcome by knockdown of LDH-A expression . Inhibition of LDH-A activity with oxamate enhanced the response of cetuximab-resistant cells to cetuximab . Cetuximab had no noticeable inhibitory effect on glycolysis in nontransformed cells . These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into cetuximab-induced cell-cycle arrest from the perspective of cancer metabolism and suggest novel strategies for enhancing cetuximab response .
Oncogene-induced senescence is now recognized as being an important mechanism in protecting against cancer . The phenotypic consequences , i.e. , the inhibition of cell proliferation , are well described in model systems and specific events/key players defined . However , there is still the need to understand , at a more global level , the network of events involved both in terms of cause and consequence . This paper shows the power of systematic proteomic analyses , both targeted and global , in addressing such biological questions , highlighting the widespread nature of histone acetylation changes , and the opposite metabolic changes to those seen in the Warburg effect .
CONTEXT Papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) is the most frequent thyroid tumor and is responsible for the overall increase in thyroid cancer incidence . S100A11 ( calgizzarin ) , a member of the S100 Ca(2+)-binding protein family , is involved in several different biological processes . S100A11 has been found up-regulated in PTC , both at the mRNA and protein levels . OBJECTIVE Through a combination of expression analysis and functional in vitro and in vivo studies , we have attempted to gain insight into the relevance of S100A11 overexpression in PTC biology . DESIGN The expression of the S100A11 gene in PTC was investigated in several gene expression data sets . The effect of S100A11 silencing on the hallmarks of the malignant phenotype of several PTC-derived cell lines was investigated . In NIH3T3 cells , the cooperation of S100A11 with the different PTC-specific oncogenes was assessed . RESULTS We found that the S100A11 gene expression is frequently up-regulated in PTC , anaplastic thyroid carcinoma , but not in follicular thyroid carcinoma . S100A11 overexpression was also detected in PTC-derived cell lines , which were then used for functional studies . S100A11 silencing in PTC-derived cell lines did not affect cell proliferation , whereas it reduced the loss of contact inhibition , anchorage-independent growth , and resistance to anoikis . Cotransfection experiments in NIH3T3 cells showed that overexpression of the S100A11 gene was able to enhance the transforming capabilities of the different PTC-associated oncogenes by affecting the loss of contact inhibition , anchorage-independent growth , and in vivo tumor formation . CONCLUSION Our data indicate that S100A11 overexpression exerts a protumoral functional role in PTC pathogenesis .
BACKGROUND Yes Associated Protein ( YAP ) has been implicated in the control of organ size by regulating cell proliferation and survival . YAP is a transcriptional coactivator that controls cellular responses through interaction with TEAD transcription factors in the nucleus , while its transcriptional functions are inhibited by phosphorylation-dependent translocation to the cytosol . YAP overexpression has been associated with different types of cancer , such as lung , skin , prostate , ovary and liver cancer . Recently , YAP was linked to E-cadherin-dependent regulation of contact inhibition in breast cancer cells . RESULTS In this study we examined YAP protein expression and cellular localization in 237 cases of human invasive breast cancer by immunohistochemistry and related its expression to clinicopathological features and E-cadherin expression . We observed that invasive lobular carcinoma is characterized by higher expression levels of both nuclear and cytosolic YAP ( p < 0.001 ) . Nuclear YAP expression did not associate with other variables such as lymph node involvement , tumor grade , tumor size , mitotic activity or the molecular sub-types of invasive breast cancer . We observed that high nuclear and cytosolic YAP expression are associated with the E-cadherin deficient breast cancer subtype ILC ( p < 0.001 ) and cell lines derived from human breast cancers and conditional mouse models of human lobular breast cancer . CONCLUSIONS Since our data indicate that nuclear YAP localization is more common in breast cancers lacking functional adherens junctions , it suggests that YAP-mediated transcription may be involved in the development and progression of invasive lobular breast cancer .
Key cellular decisions , such as proliferation or growth arrest , typically occur at spatially defined locations within tissues . Loss of this spatial control is a hallmark of many diseases , including cancer . Yet , how these patterns are established is incompletely understood . Here , we report that physical and architectural features of a multicellular sheet inform cells about their proliferative capacity through mechanical regulation of YAP and TAZ , known mediators of Hippo signaling and organ growth . YAP/TAZ activity is confined to cells exposed to mechanical stresses , such as stretching , location at edges/curvatures contouring an epithelial sheet , or stiffness of the surrounding extracellular matrix . Weidentify the F-actin-capping/severing proteins Cofilin , CapZ , and Gelsolin as essential gatekeepers that limit YAP/TAZ activity in cells experiencing low mechanical stresses , including contact inhibition of proliferation . We propose that mechanical forces are overarching regulators of YAP/TAZ in multicellular contexts , setting responsiveness to Hippo , WNT , and GPCR signaling .
Although the immense efforts have been made for cancer prevention , early diagnosis , and treatment , cancer morbidity and mortality has not been decreased during last forty years . Especially , lung cancer is top-ranked in cancer-associated human death . Therefore , effective strategy is strongly required for the management of lung cancer . In the present study , we found that novel daphnane diterpenoids , yuanhualine ( YL ) , yuanhuahine ( YH ) and yuanhuagine ( YG ) isolated from the flower of Daphne genkwa ( Thymelaeaceae ) , exhibited potent anti-proliferative activities against human lung A549 cells with the IC50 values of 7.0 , 15.2 and 24.7 nM , respectively . Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the daphnane diterpenoids induced cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 as well as G2/M phase in A549 cells . The cell-cycle arrests were well correlated with the expression of checkpoint proteins including the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and p53 and down-regulation of cyclin A , cyclin B1 , cyclin E , cyclin dependent kinase 4 , cdc2 , phosphorylation of Rb and cMyc expression . In the analysis of signal transduction molecules , the daphnane diterpenoids suppressed the activation of Akt , STAT3 and Src in human lung cancer cells . The daphnane diterpenoids also exerted the potent anti-proliferative activity against anticancer-drug resistant cancer cells including gemcitabine-resistant A549 , gefitinib- , erlotinib-resistant H292 cells . Synergistic effects in the growth inhibition were also observed when yuanhualine was combined with gemcitabine , gefitinib or erlotinib in A549 cells . Taken together , these findings suggest that the novel daphnane diterpenoids might provide lead candidates for the development of therapeutic agents for human lung cancers .
Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene amplification and overexpression are commonly present in glioblastoma , and confer advantages of growth , invasiveness and radio/chemotherapy-resistance for tumour cells . Here , we assessed the role of EGFR activation for downstream mitogenic signalling in the commonly used glioblastoma cell line U251 . Despite the high expression level , activation of EGFR under standard culture conditions was low . Intact EGFR function was verified by the rapid phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream mitogen-activated protein(MAP) kinase ERK1/2 upon addition of exogenous EGF to serum-starved cells . By contrast , addition of fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) activated downstream ERK1/2 via the MAP kinase kinase without phosphorylating EGFR . A phosphoreceptor tyrosine kinase array showed FBS-induced activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R),and the IGF-1R inhibitor AG1024 inhibited FBS-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 , implying IGF-1R as the major driver of FBS-associated mitogenic signalling in the absence of exogenous EGF . These findings have important implications for in vitro drug testing in glioblastoma . Moreover , activation of ERK1/2 was also strongly influenced by growth state and cell density of U251 cultures . Re-seeding exponentially growing cultures at high cell density induced p27/CDKN1B expression and suppressed P-ERK1/2 indicating a certain regulation of proliferation by contact inhibition . Strikingly , highly activated ERK1/2 signalling and cell cycle progression occurred when cells were released from plateau phase regardless of high seeding density . This phenomenon might implicate a proliferation response in the early recurrence observed after clinical therapy in glioblastoma patients . However , whether it will recapitulate in vivo remains to be demonstrated .
Accumulating data suggest arsenic may be an endocrine disruptor and tentatively linked to breast cancer by some studies . Therefore , we tested the effects of chronic inorganic arsenic exposure on the normal estrogen receptor ( ER)-negative breast epithelial cell line , MCF-10A . Cells were chronically exposed to a low-level arsenite ( 500nM ) for up to 24weeks . Markers of cancer cell phenotype and the expression of critical genes relevant to breast cancer or stem cells ( SCs ) were examined . After 24weeks , chronic arsenic-exposed breast epithelial ( CABE ) cells showed increases in secreted MMP activity , colony formation , invasion , and proliferation rate , indicating an acquired cancer cell phenotype . These CABE cells presented with basal-like breast cancer characteristics , including ER-alpha , HER-2 , and progesterone receptor negativity , and overexpression of K5 and p63 . Putative CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) breast SCs were increased to 80% over control in CABE cells . CABE cells also formed multilayer cell mounds , indicative of loss of contact inhibition . These mounds showed high levels of K5 and p63 , indicating the potential presence of cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) . Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition occurred during arsenic exposure . Overexpression of aromatase , a key rate-limiting enzyme in estrogen synthesis , occurred with arsenic starting early on in exposure . Levels of 17beta-estradiol increased in CABE cells and their conditioned medium . The aromatase inhibitor letrozole abolished arsenic-induced increases in 17beta-estradiol production and reversed cancer cell phenotype . Thus , chronic arsenic exposure drives human breast epithelia into a cancer cell phenotype with an apparent overabundance of putative CSCs . Arsenic appears to transform breast epithelia through overexpression of aromatase , thereby activating oncogenic processes independent of ER .
Metabolic reprogramming in cancer is manifested by persistent aerobic glycolysis and suppression of mitochondrial function and is known as the Warburg effect . The Warburg effect contributes to cancer progression and is considered to be a promising therapeutic target . Understanding the mechanisms used by cancer cells to suppress their mitochondria may lead to development of new approaches to reverse metabolic reprogramming . We have evaluated mitochondrial function and morphology in poorly respiring LM7 and 143B osteosarcoma ( OS ) cell lines showing the Warburg effect in comparison with actively respiring Saos2 and HOS OS cells and noncancerous osteoblastic hFOB cells . In LM7 and 143B cells , we detected markers of the mitochondrial permeability transition ( MPT ) , such as mitochondrial swelling , depolarization , and membrane permeabilization . In addition , we detected mitochondrial swelling in human OS xenografts in mice and archival human OS specimens using electron microscopy . The MPT inhibitor sanglifehrin A reversed MPT markers and increased respiration in LM7 and 143B cells . Our data suggest that the MPT may play a role in suppression of mitochondrial function , contributing to the Warburg effect in cancer .
Cancer cells require glucose to support their rapid growth through a process known as aerobic glycolysis , or the Warburg effect . As in ovarian cancer cells , increased metabolic activity and glucose concentration has been linked to aggressiveness of cancer . However , it is unclear as to whether targeting the glycolytic pathway may kill the malignant cells and likely have broad therapeutic implications against ovarian cancer metastasis . In the present research , we found that EF24 , a HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor , could significantly block glucose uptake , the rate of glycolysis , and lactate production compared with vehicle treatment in SKOV-3 , A2780 and OVCAR-3 cells . These results might possibly contribute to the further observation that EF24 could inhibit ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion from wound healing and Transwell assays . Furthermore , as an important mediator of glucose metabolism , glucose transporter 1 ( Glut1 ) was found to contribute to the function of EF24 in both energy metabolism and metastasis . To examine the effect of EF24 and the mediated role of Glut1 in vivo in a xenograph subcutaneous tumor model , intraperitoneal metastasis and lung metastasis model were introduced . Our results indicated that EF24 treatment could inhibit tumor growth , intraperitoneal metastasis and lung metastasis of SKOV-3 cells , and Glut1 is a possible mediator for the role of EF24 . In conclusion , our results highlight that an anti-cancer reagent with an inhibiting effect on energy metabolism could inhibit metastasis , and EF24 is a possible candidate for anti-metastasis therapeutic applications for ovarian cancer .
Pyruvate kinase M2 ( PKM2 ) is a key player in the Warburg effect of cancer cells . However , the mechanisms of regulating PKM2 are not fully elucidated . Here , we identified the protein-serine/threonine kinase PIM2 , a known oncogene , as a novel binding partner of PKM2 . The interaction between PIM2 and PKM2 was confirmed by multiple biochemical approaches in vitro and in cultured cells . Importantly , we found that PIM2 could directly phosphorylate PKM2 on the Thr-454 residue , resulting in an increase of PKM2 protein levels . Compared with wild type , PKM2 with the phosphorylation-defective mutation displayed a reduced effect on glycolysis , co-activating HIF-1\u03b1 and \u03b2-catenin , and cell proliferation , while enhancing mitochondrial respiration of cancer cells . These findings demonstrate that PIM2-dependent phosphorylation of PKM2 is critical for regulating the Warburg effect in cancer , highlighting PIM2 as a potential therapeutic target .
Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults . Overexpression of the EGF receptor ( EGFR ) is recognized as a widespread oncogenic signature in glioblastoma multiforme , but the complexity of its contributions is not fully understood , nor the most effective ways to leverage anti-EGFR therapy in this setting . Hypoxia is known to drive the aggressive character of glioblastoma multiforme by promoting aerobic glycolysis rather than pyruvate oxidation carried out in mitochondria ( OXPHOS ) , a phenomenon termed the Warburg effect , which is a general feature of oncogenesis . In this study , we report that hypoxia drives expression of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase ( PDK1 ) and EGFR along with the hypoxia-inducing factor ( HIF)-1\u03b1 in human glioblastoma multiforme cells . PDK1 is a HIF-1-regulated gene and our findings indicated that hypoxia-induced PDK1 expression may promote EGFR activation , initiating a feed-forward loop that can sustain malignant progression . RNAi-mediated attenuation of PDK1 and EGFR lowered PDK1-EGFR activation and decreased HIF-1\u03b1 expression , shifting the Warburg phenotype to OXPHOS and inhibiting glioblastoma multiforme growth and proliferation . In clinical specimens of glioblastoma multiforme , we found that immunohistochemical expression of PDK1 , EGFR , and HIF-1\u03b1 were elevated in glioblastoma multiforme specimens when compared with normal brain tissues . Collectively , our studies establish PDK1 as a key driver and candidate therapeutic target in glioblastoma multiforme .
BACKGROUND Anti-angiogenic treatment of glioblastoma characteristically results in therapy resistance and tumor progression via diffuse infiltration . Monitoring tumor progression in these patients is thwarted because therapy results in tumor invisibility in contrast-enhanced ( CE ) MRI . To address this problem , we examined whether tumor progression could be monitored by metabolic mapping using ( 1)H MR spectroscopic imaging ( MRSI ) . METHODS We treated groups of BALB/c nu/nu mice carrying different orthotopic diffuse-infiltrative glioblastoma xenografts with bevacizumab ( anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] antibody , n = 13 ) , cabozantinib ( combined VEGF receptor 2/c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor , n = 11 ) , or placebo ( n = 15 ) and compared CE-MRI with MRS-derived metabolic maps before , during , and after treatment . Metabolic maps and CE-MRIs were subsequently correlated to histology and immunohistochemistry . RESULTS In vivo imaging of choline/n-acetyl aspartate ratios via multivoxel MRS is better able to evaluate response to therapy than CE-MRI . Lactate imaging revealed that diffuse infiltrative areas in glioblastoma xenografts did not present with excessive glycolysis . In contrast , glycolysis was observed in hypoxic areas in angiogenesis-dependent compact regions of glioma only , especially after anti-angiogenic treatment . CONCLUSION Our data present MRSI as a powerful and feasible approach that is superior to CE-MRI and may provide handles for optimizing treatment of glioma . Furthermore , we show that glycolysis is more prominent in hypoxic areas than in areas of diffuse infiltrative growth . The Warburg hypothesis of persisting glycolysis in tumors under normoxic conditions may thus not be valid for diffuse glioma .
BACKGROUND Alcohol consumption promotes hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The responsible mechanisms are not well understood . Hepatocarcinogenesis increases with age and is enhanced by factors that impose a demand for liver regeneration . Because alcohol is hepatotoxic , habitual alcohol ingestion evokes a recurrent demand for hepatic regeneration . The alcohol-preferring ( P ) rat model mimics the level of alcohol consumption by humans who habitually abuse alcohol . Previously , we showed that habitual heavy alcohol ingestion amplified age-related hepatocarcinogenesis in P rats , with over 80% of alcohol-consuming P rats developing HCCs after 18months of alcohol exposure , compared with only 5% of water-drinking controls . METHODS Herein , we used quantitative real-time PCR and quantitative immunocytochemistry to compare liver tissues from alcohol-consuming P rats and water-fed P rat controls after 6 , 12 , or 18months of drinking . We aimed to identify potential mechanisms that might underlie the differences in liver cancer formation and hypothesized that chronic alcohol ingestion would activate Hedgehog ( HH ) , a regenerative signaling pathway that is overactivated in HCC . RESULTS Chronic alcohol ingestion amplified age-related degenerative changes in hepatocytes , but did not cause appreciable liver inflammation or fibrosis even after 18months of heavy drinking . HH signaling was also enhanced by alcohol exposure , as evidenced by increased levels of mRNAs encoding HH ligands , HH-regulated transcription factors , and HH target genes . Immunocytochemistry confirmed increased alcohol-related accumulation of HH ligand-producing cells and HH-responsive target cells . HH-related regenerative responses were also induced in alcohol-exposed rats . Three of these processes ( i.e. , deregulated progenitor expansion , the reverse Warburg effect , and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions ) are known to promote cancer growth in other tissues . CONCLUSIONS Alcohol-related changes in Hedgehog signaling and resultant deregulation of liver cell replacement might promote hepatocarcinogenesis .
Cancers are characterized by an increasing glycolytic activity , which is called the Warburg effect . Although this phenomenon is well known , the mechanism of the enhanced rate of glycolysis in cancer has not yet been clearly recognized . The present study investigated the glycolytic rate , regulatory enzymatic activities and the expression of phosphofructokinase-1 ( PFK-1 ) in human breast cancer and paracancer tissues . Human breast cancer tissues have an increased degree of glycolytic efficiency and regulatory enzymatic activities , which have been shown in previous studies . However , the present study identified a number of novel observations . The total PFK-1 levels were higher in human breast cancer tissues than in paracancer tissues , and further investigations revealed differential PFK-1 isoenzyme expression patterns between human breast cancer and paracancer tissues . The human breast cancer and paracancer tissues mainly expressed PFK-P and PFK-L isoforms , respectively . Linear-regression analysis showed that , depending on the pathological stage of breast cancer , the expression of PFK-P was significantly positively correlated with the activity of PFK-1 . Thus , during the development of human breast cancer , the enhancement of glycolytic activity depends primarily on the conversion of the PFK-1 , from PFK-L to PFK-P .
BACKGROUND Aerobic glycolysis , namely the Warburg effect , is the main hallmark of cancer cells . Mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction has been proposed to be one of the major causes for such glycolytic shift . This hypothesis has been revisited as tumors appear to undergo waves of gene regulation during progression , some of which rely on functional mitochondria . In this framework , the role of mitochondrial complex I is still debated , in particular with respect to the effect of mitochondrial DNA mutations in cancer metabolism . The aim of this work is to provide the proof of concept that functional complex I is necessary to sustain tumor progression . METHODS Complex I-null osteosarcoma cells were complemented with allotopically expressed complex I subunit 1 ( MT-ND1 ) . Complex I re-assembly and function recovery , also in terms of NADH consumption , were assessed . Clones were tested for their ability to grow in soft agar and to generate tumor masses in nude mice . Hypoxia levels were evaluated via pimonidazole staining and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 ( HIF-1\u03b1 ) immunoblotting and histochemical staining. 454-pyrosequencing was implemented to obtain global transcriptomic profiling of allotopic and non-allotopic xenografts . RESULTS Complementation of a truncative mutation in the gene encoding MT-ND1 , showed that a functional enzyme was required to perform the glycolytic shift during the hypoxia response and to induce a Warburg profile in vitro and in vivo , fostering cancer progression . Such trigger was mediated by HIF-1\u03b1 , whose stabilization was regulated after recovery of the balance between \u03b1-ketoglutarate and succinate due to a recuperation of NADH consumption that followed complex I rescue . CONCLUSION Respiratory complex I is essential for the induction of Warburg effect and adaptation to hypoxia of cancer cells , allowing them to sustain tumor growth . Differently from other mitochondrial tumor suppressor genes , therefore , a complex I severe mutation such as the one here reported may confer anti-tumorigenic properties , highlighting the prognostic values of such genetic markers in cancer .
Aims : RAS-induced tumorigenesis has been suggested to follow a three-stage model consisting of an initial RAS activation , senescence induction , and evasion of p53-dependent senescence checkpoints . While reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) act as second messengers in RAS-induced senescence , they are also involved in oncogenic transformation by inducing proliferation and promoting mutations . In the current work , we investigated the role of extracellular superoxide dismutase ( SOD3 ) in RAS-induced senescence and immortalization in vitro and in vivo . We used a mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) primary cell model together with immortalized and transformed human cell lines derived from papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer . Results : Based on our data , sod3 RNA interference in H-RasV12-transduced cells markedly inhibited cell growth , while sod3 over-expression in MEFs initially caused a proliferative burst followed by the activation of DNA damage checkpoints , induction of p53-p21 signal transduction , and senescence . Subsequently , sod3-transduced MEF cells developed co-operative p21-p16 down-regulation and acquired transformed cell characteristics such as increased telomerase activity , loss of contact inhibition , growth in low-nutrient conditions , and in vivo tumorigenesis . Interestingly , as reported previously with RAS , we showed a dose-dependent response to SOD3 in vitro and in vivo involving transcriptional and non-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms . Innovation : SOD3 may mediate H-RasV12-induced initiation of primary cell immortalization . Conclusions : Our results indicate that SOD3 influences growth signaling in primary and cancer cells downstream of the ras oncogene and could serve as a therapy target at an early tumorigenesis phase .
Tumour cells primarily utilize aerobic glycolysis for energy production , a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect . Its mechanism is not well understood . The tumour suppressor gene p53 is frequently mutated in tumours . Many tumour-associated mutant p53 ( mutp53 ) proteins not only lose tumour suppressive function but also gain new oncogenic functions that are independent of wild-type p53 , defined as mutp53 gain of function ( GOF ) . Here we show that tumour-associated mutp53 stimulates the Warburg effect in cultured cells and mutp53 knockin mice as a new mutp53 GOF . Mutp53 stimulates the Warburg effect through promoting GLUT1 translocation to the plasma membrane , which is mediated by activated RhoA and its downstream effector ROCK . Inhibition of RhoA/ROCK/GLUT1 signalling largely abolishes mutp53 GOF in stimulating the Warburg effect . Furthermore , inhibition of glycolysis in tumour cells greatly compromises mutp53 GOF in promoting tumorigenesis . Thus , our results reveal a new mutp53 GOF and a mechanism for controlling the Warburg effect .
Aberrant glucose metabolism characterized by high levels of glycolysis , even in the presence of oxygen , is an important hallmark of cancer . This metabolic reprogramming referred to as the Warburg effect is essential to the survival of tumor cells and provides them with substrates required for biomass generation . Molecular mechanisms responsible for this shift in glucose metabolism remain elusive . As described herein , we found that aberrant expression of the proinflammatory protein transglutaminase 2 ( TG2 ) is an important regulator of the Warburg effect in mammary epithelial cells . Mechanistically , TG2 regulated metabolic reprogramming by constitutively activating nuclear factor ( NF)-\u03baB , which binds to the hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF)-1\u03b1 promoter and induces its expression even under normoxic conditions . TG2/NF-\u03baB-induced increase in HIF-1\u03b1 expression was associated with increased glucose uptake , increased lactate production and decreased oxygen consumption by mitochondria . Experimental suppression of TG2 attenuated HIF-1\u03b1 expression and reversed downstream events in mammary epithelial cells . Moreover , downregulation of p65/RelA or HIF-1\u03b1 expression in these cells restored normal glucose uptake , lactate production , mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic protein expression . Our results suggest that aberrant expression of TG2 is a master regulator of metabolic reprogramming and facilitates metabolic alterations in epithelial cells even under normoxic conditions . A TG2-induced shift in glucose metabolism helps breast cancer cells to survive under stressful conditions and promotes their metastatic competence .
Candida albicans infections are very frequent in cancer patients , whose immune system is often compromised , but whether this fungal pathogen affects cancer progression is unknown . C. albicans infection involves endogenous production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) . Increased levels of these cytokines have already been correlated with metastasis of most common cancer types . In this study , a well-established model of IL-18-dependent hepatic melanoma metastasis was used to study whether C. albicans can alter the ability of murine B16 melanoma ( B16M ) cells to colonize the liver . First , we determined the ability of intrasplenically ( IS ) injected B16M cells to metastasize into the liver of mice challenged with 5 x 10(4) C. albicans cells by three different routes ( intravenous , IV ; intrasplenic , IS ; or intraperitoneal , IP ) 12 h prior to injection of B16M cells . We demonstrated that C. albicans significantly increased metastasis of B16M cells with all three fungal injection routes . Pro-metastatic effects occurred when hepatic colonization with B16M cells place after the peak of TNF-alpha and IL-18 levels had been reached in the hepatic blood of fungal challenged mice . In a second set of experiments , mice were fungal challenged 4 days after injection of B16M cells . In these mice , C. albicans also potentiated the growth of established micro-metastases . Significantly , the fungal challenge had pro-metastatic effects without the C. albicans being able to reach the liver , suggesting that soluble factors can promote metastasis in remote sites . Mouse treatment with antifungal ketoconazol abrogated hepatic TNF-alpha stimulation by C. albicans and prevented the enhancement of hepatic metastasis in fungal challenged-mice . Therefore , the pro-inflammatory microenvironment generated by the host's systemic response to C. albicans stimulates circulating cancer cells to metastasize in the liver .
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) are widely distributed immunotoxic and carcinogenic environmental contaminants , known to affect macrophages . In order to identify their molecular targets in such cells , we have analyzed gene expression profile of primary human macrophages treated by the prototypical PAH benzo(a)pyrene ( BaP ) , using pangenomic oligonucleotides microarrays . Exposure of macrophages to BaP for 8 and 24 h resulted in 96 and 1100 genes , differentially expressed by at least a twofold change factor , respectively . Some of these targets , including the chemokine receptor CXCR5 , the G protein-coupled receptor 35 ( GPR35 ) , and the Ras regulator RASAL1 , have not been previously shown to be affected by PAHs , in contrast to others , such as interleukin-1beta and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) repressor . These BaP-mediated gene regulations were fully validated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays for some selected genes . Their bioinformatic analysis indicated that biological functions linked to immunity , inflammation , and cell death were among the most affected by BaP in human macrophages and that the AhR and p53 signaling pathways were the most significant canonical pathways activated by the PAH . AhR and p53 implications were moreover fully confirmed by the prevention of BaP-related upregulation of some selected target genes by AhR silencing or the use of pifithrin-alpha , an inhibitor of PAH bioactivation-related DNA damage/p53 pathways . Overall , these data , through identifying genes and signaling pathways targeted by PAHs in human macrophages , may contribute to better understand the molecular basis of the immunotoxicity of these environmental contaminants .
Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) is a high molecular weight protein serine/threonine kinase that plays a central role in the maintenance of genomic integrity by activating cell cycle checkpoints and promoting repair of DNA double-strand breaks . Little is known about the regulatory mechanisms for ATM expression itself . MicroRNAs are naturally existing regulators that modulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner . Here , we show that a human microRNA , miR-421 , suppresses ATM expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region ( 3'UTR ) of ATM transcripts . Ectopic expression of miR-421 resulted in S-phase cell cycle checkpoint changes and an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation , creating a cellular phenotype similar to that of cells derived from ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) patients . Blocking the interaction between miR-421 and ATM 3'UTR with an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide rescued the defective phenotype caused by miR-421 overexpression , indicating that ATM mediates the effect of miR-421 on cell cycle checkpoint and radiosensitivity . Overexpression of the N-Myc transcription factor , an oncogene frequently amplified in neuroblastoma , induced miR-421 expression , which , in turn , down-regulated ATM expression , establishing a linear signaling pathway that may contribute to N-Myc-induced tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma . Taken together , our findings implicate a previously undescribed regulatory mechanism for ATM expression and ATM-dependent DNA damage response and provide several potential targets for treating neuroblastoma and perhaps A-T .
DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) trigger ATM ( ataxia telangiectasia mutated ) signalling and elicit genomic rearrangements and chromosomal fragmentation if misrepaired or unrepaired . Although most DSB repair is ATM-independent , approximately 15% of ionizing radiation ( IR)-induced breaks persist in the absence of ATM-signalling. 53BP1 ( p53-binding protein 1 ) facilitates ATM-dependent DSB repair but is largely dispensable for ATM activation or checkpoint arrest . ATM promotes DSB repair within heterochromatin by phosphorylating KAP-1 ( KRAB-associated protein 1 , also known as TIF1beta , TRIM28 or KRIP-1 ; ref. 2 ) . Here , we show that the ATM signalling mediator proteins MDC1 , RNF8 , RNF168 and 53BP1 are also required for heterochromatic DSB repair . Although KAP-1 phosphorylation is critical for 53BP1-mediated repair , overall phosphorylated KAP-1 ( pKAP-1 ) levels are only modestly affected by 53BP1 loss. pKAP-1 is transiently pan-nuclear but also forms foci overlapping with gammaH2AX in heterochromatin . Cells that do not form 53BP1 foci , including human RIDDLE ( radiosensitivity , immunodeficiency , dysmorphic features and learning difficulties ) syndrome cells , fail to form pKAP-1 foci. 53BP1 amplifies Mre11-NBS1 accumulation at late-repairing DSBs , concentrating active ATM and leading to robust , localized pKAP-1 . We propose that ionizing-radiation induced foci ( IRIF ) spatially concentrate ATM activity to promote localized alterations in regions of chromatin otherwise inhibitory to repair .
Diets rich in fruits and vegetables are associated with lower risk of cancer which may be conferred in part by the antioxidant properties of these foods . However , antioxidant supplementation or increased consumption of antioxidant-rich foods has been reported to have inconsistent effects on DNA damage . The present work ( the DART study ) investigated the extent of inter-individual variation in DNA damage , the capacity for base excision repair ( BER ) and the responses of both variables to supplementation with an antioxidant supplement for 6 weeks . There was a wide inter-individual variation in endogenous lymphocyte DNA strand breaks ( 8-fold variation ) , in damage after a challenge with H2O2 ( 16-fold variation ) and in DNA repair ( 41-fold variation ) measured using the comet assay . When stratified into tertiles according to the pre-supplementation level of endogenous DNA damage , there was a statistically significant decrease in DNA damage after supplementation in the tertile with the highest pre-supplementation level of damage . There was no effect of supplementation on BER . Endogenous DNA damage level before supplementation was significantly different ( P = 0.037 ) between the three genotypes for the Val16Ala single nucleotide polymorphism in manganese superoxide dismutase ( rs4880 ) with individuals homozygous/wild type showing less damage than those carrying the alanine variant .
PURPOSE Genomic complexity is present in approximately 15% to 30% of all chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) and has emerged as a strong independent predictor of rapid disease progression and short remission duration in CLL . We conducted this study to advance our understanding of the causes of genomic complexity in CLL . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We have obtained quantitative measurements of radiation-induced apoptosis and radiation-induced ATM autophosphorylation in purified CLL cells from 158 and 140 patients , respectively , and have used multivariate analysis to identify independent contributions of various biological variables on genomic complexity in CLL . RESULTS Here , we identify a strong independent effect of radiation resistance on elevated genomic complexity in CLL and describe radiation resistance as a predictor for shortened CLL survival . Furthermore , using multivariate analysis , we identify del17p/p53 aberrations , del11q , del13q14 type II ( invariably resulting in Rb loss ) , and CD38 expression as independent predictors of genomic complexity in CLL , with aberrant p53 as a predictor of approximately 50% of genomic complexity in CLL . Focusing on del11q , we determined that normalized ATM activity was a modest predictor of genomic complexity but was not independent of del11q . Through single nucleotide polymorphism array-based fine mapping of del11q , we identified frequent monoallelic loss of Mre11 and H2AFX in addition to ATM , indicative of compound del11q-resident gene defects in the DNA double-strand break response . CONCLUSIONS Our quantitative analysis links multiple molecular defects , including for the first time del11q and large 13q14 deletions ( type II ) , to elevated genomic complexity in CLL , thereby suggesting mechanisms for the observed clinical aggressiveness of CLL in patients with unstable genomes .
Acute endothelial cell apoptosis and microvascular compromise couple gastrointestinal tract irradiation to reproductive death of intestinal crypt stem cell clonogens ( SCCs ) following high-dose radiation . Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of endothelial apoptosis prevents intestinal damage , but as the radiation dose is escalated , SCCs become directly susceptible to an alternate cell death mechanism , mediated via ceramide synthase ( CS)-stimulated de novo synthesis of the proapoptotic sphingolipid ceramide , and p53-independent apoptosis of crypt SCCs . We previously reported that ataxia-telangiectasia mutated deficiency resets the primary radiation lethal pathway , allowing CS-mediated apoptosis at the low-dose range of radiation . The mechanism for this event , termed target reordering , remains unknown . Here , we show that inactivation of DNA damage repair pathways signals CS-mediated apoptosis in crypt SCCs , presumably via persistent unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) . Genetic loss of function of sensors and transducers of DNA DSB repair confers the CS-mediated lethal pathway in intestines of sv129/B6Mre11(ATLD1/ATLD1) and C57BL/6(Prkdc/SCID) ( severe combined immunodeficient ) mice exposed to low-dose radiation . In contrast , CS-mediated SCC lethality was mitigated in irradiated gain-of-function Rad50(s/s) mice , and epistasis studies order Rad50 upstream of Mre11 . These studies suggest unrepaired DNA DSBs as causative in target reordering in intestinal SCCs . As such , we provide an in vivo model of DNA damage repair that is standardized , can be exploited to understand allele-specific regulation in intact tissue , and is pharmacologically tractable .
BACKGROUND Folate ( vitamin B9 ) is essential for cellular proliferation as it is involved in the biosynthesis of deoxythymidine monophosphate ( dTMP ) and s-adenosylmethionine ( AdoMet ) . The link between folate depletion and the genesis and progression of cancers of epithelial origin is of high clinical relevance , but still unclear . We recently demonstrated that sensitivity to low folate availability is affected by the rate of polyamine biosynthesis , which is prominent in prostate cells . We , therefore , hypothesized that prostate cells might be highly susceptible to genetic , epigenetic and phenotypic changes consequent to folate restriction . RESULTS We studied the consequences of long-term , mild folate depletion in a model comprised of three syngenic cell lines derived from the transgenic adenoma of the mouse prostate ( TRAMP ) model , recapitulating different stages of prostate cancer ; benign , transformed and metastatic . High-performance liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that mild folate depletion ( 100 nM ) sufficed to induce imbalance in both the nucleotide and AdoMet pools in all prostate cell lines . Random oligonucleotide-primed synthesis ( ROPS ) revealed a significant increase in uracil misincorporation and DNA single strand breaks , while spectral karyotype analysis ( SKY ) identified five novel chromosomal rearrangements in cells grown with mild folate depletion . Using global approaches , we identified an increase in CpG island and histone methylation upon folate depletion despite unchanged levels of total 5-methylcytosine , indicating a broad effect of folate depletion on epigenetic regulation . These genomic changes coincided with phenotype changes in the prostate cells including increased anchorage-independent growth and reduced sensitivity to folate depletion . CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that prostate cells are highly susceptible to genetic and epigenetic changes consequent to mild folate depletion as compared to cells grown with supraphysiological amounts of folate ( 2 microM ) routinely used in tissue culture . In addition , we elucidate for the first time the contribution of these aspects to consequent phenotype changes in epithelial cells . These results provide a strong rationale for studying the effects of folate manipulation on the prostate in vivo , where cells might be more sensitive to changes in folate status resulting from folate supplementation or antifolate therapeutic approaches .
Epidemiological studies exploring the connection between hypertension and cancer incidence find a higher cancer mortality in hypertensive patients , particularly elevated in hypertension associated with a stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system . Primary aldosteronism , with plasma aldosterone levels between 0.5 and 1 nM ( 18-36 ng/dL ) and local aldosterone levels up to 500 nM ( 18,000 ng/dL ) , is now recognised as a more common cause for hypertension . We recently found angiotensin II to be genotoxic due to its induction of oxidative stress . Since aldosterone in higher concentrations also has oxidative effects , its potential genotoxic action in pig LLC-PK1 cells with properties of proximal tubules was analysed . DNA damage was evaluated by two test systems : the comet assay , and the micronucleus frequency test . The results showed that aldosterone concentrations starting from 10 nM ( 360 ng/dL ) caused a significant increase of DNA damage monitored with the comet assay in LLC-PK1 , while there was no change in cell vitality and proliferation . The micronucleus frequency test revealed that 10 nM aldosterone also leads to the formation of micronuclei . Furthermore , the formation of superoxide radicals in the cells by this aldosterone concentration could be detected with the superoxide-specific stain dihydroethidium . Further evidence for oxidative stress-induced DNA damage was its reversibility by the antioxidants tempol and catalase . Addition of the steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone or the novel selective nonsteroidal antagonist ( R)-BR-4628 reduced the DNA damage and the amount of superoxide radicals indicating a receptor-dependent process .
Recently , the use of gold nanoparticles as potential tumor selective radiosensitizers has been proposed as a breakthrough in radiotherapy . Experiments in living cells and in vivo have demonstrated the efficiency of the metal nanoparticles when combined with low energy x-ray radiations ( below conventional 1 MeV Linac radiation ) . Further studies on DNA have been performed in order to better understand the fundamental processes of sensitization and to further improve the method . In this work , we propose a new strategy based on the combination of platinum nanoparticles with irradiation by fast ions effectively used in hadron therapy . It is observed in particular that nanoparticles enhance strongly lethal damage in DNA , with an efficiency factor close to 2 for double strand breaks . In order to disentangle the effect of the nano-design architecture , a comparison with the effects of dispersed metal atoms at the same concentration has been performed . It is thus shown that the sensitization in nanoparticles is enhanced due to auto-amplified electronic cascades inside the nanoparticles , which reinforces the energy deposition in the close vicinity of the metal . Finally , the combination of fast ion radiation ( hadron therapy ) with platinum nanoparticles should strongly improve cancer therapy protocols .
In eukaryotic cells , multiple DNA repair mechanisms respond to a wide variety of DNA lesions . Homologous recombination-dependent repair provides a pathway for dealing with DNA double-strand breaks and replication fork demise . A key step in this process is the resolution of recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions ( HJs ) . Recently , nucleases from yeast ( Yen1 ) and human cells ( GEN1 ) were identified that can resolve HJ intermediates , in a manner analogous to the E. coli HJ resolvase RuvC . Here , we have analyzed the role of Yen1 in DNA repair in S. cerevisiae , and show that while yen1Delta mutants are repair-proficient , yen1Delta mus81Delta double mutants are exquisitely sensitive to a variety of DNA-damaging agents that disturb replication fork progression . This phenotype is dependent upon RAD52 , indicating that toxic recombination intermediates accumulate in the absence of Yen1 and Mus81 . After MMS treatment , yen1Delta mus81Delta double mutants arrest with a G2 DNA content and unsegregated chromosomes . These findings indicate that Yen1 can act upon recombination/repair intermediates that arise in MUS81-defective cells following replication fork damage .
BRIT1 protein ( also known as MCPH1 ) contains 3 BRCT domains which are conserved in BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and other important molecules involved in DNA damage signaling , DNA repair , and tumor suppression . BRIT1 mutations or aberrant expression are found in primary microcephaly patients as well as in cancer patients . Recent in vitro studies suggest that BRIT1/MCPH1 functions as a novel key regulator in the DNA damage response pathways . To investigate its physiological role and dissect the underlying mechanisms , we generated BRIT1(-/-) mice and identified its essential roles in mitotic and meiotic recombination DNA repair and in maintaining genomic stability . Both BRIT1(-/-) mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were hypersensitive to gamma-irradiation . BRIT1(-/-) MEFs and T lymphocytes exhibited severe chromatid breaks and reduced RAD51 foci formation after irradiation . Notably , BRIT1(-/-) mice were infertile and meiotic homologous recombination was impaired . BRIT1-deficient spermatocytes exhibited a failure of chromosomal synapsis , and meiosis was arrested at late zygotene of prophase I accompanied by apoptosis . In mutant spermatocytes , DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) were formed , but localization of RAD51 or BRCA2 to meiotic chromosomes was severely impaired . In addition , we found that BRIT1 could bind to RAD51/BRCA2 complexes and that , in the absence of BRIT1 , recruitment of RAD51 and BRCA2 to chromatin was reduced while their protein levels were not altered , indicating that BRIT1 is involved in mediating recruitment of RAD51/BRCA2 to the damage site . Collectively , our BRIT1-null mouse model demonstrates that BRIT1 is essential for maintaining genomic stability in vivo to protect the hosts from both programmed and irradiation-induced DNA damages , and its depletion causes a failure in both mitotic and meiotic recombination DNA repair via impairing RAD51/BRCA2's function and as a result leads to infertility and genomic instability in mice .
We investigated the mechanisms of DNA exit during single-cell gel electrophoresis ( the comet assay ) by measuring the kinetics of the comet tail formation . In the neutral comet assay , the rate of DNA exit was found to be dependent on the topological state of DNA , which was influenced by either ethidium bromide or a low radiation dose . The results clearly show that the comet tail is formed by extended DNA loops : the loop extension , being reversible when the DNA torsional constraint remains in the loops , is favored when the constraint is relaxed . The kinetics of the comet formation in the case of a high radiation dose points out that accumulation of the single-strand breaks causes DNA fragmentation . In contrast to the neutral comet assay , the alkaline comet assay is not related to the chromatin loops . Our results imply that the alkaline treatment induces detachment of the loops from the nuclear matrix , and the comet tail is formed by ssDNA fragments , the ends of which are pulled out from the comet head by electric force . We suggest that the kinetic approach can be considered as an important improvement of the comet assay .
Although the immunomodulatory effects of many herbs have been extensively studied , research related to possible immunomodulatory effects of various spices is relatively scarce . Here , the potential immunomodulatory effects of black pepper and cardamom are investigated . Our data show that black pepper and cardamom aqueous extracts significantly enhance splenocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent , synergistic fashion . Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments reveal that black pepper and cardamom significantly enhance and suppress , respectively , T helper ( Th)1 cytokine release by splenocytes . Conversely , Th2 cytokine release by splenocytes is significantly suppressed and enhanced by black pepper and cardamom , respectively . Experimental evidence suggests that black pepper and cardamom extracts exert pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory roles , respectively . Consistently , nitric oxide production by macrophages is significantly augmented and reduced by black pepper and cardamom , respectively . Remarkably , it is evident that black pepper and cardamom extracts significantly enhance the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells , indicating their potential anti-cancer effects . Our findings strongly suggest that black pepper and cardamom exert immunomodulatory roles and antitumor activities , and hence they manifest themselves as natural agents that can promote the maintenance of a healthy immune system . We anticipate that black pepper and cardamom constituents can be used as potential therapeutic tools to regulate inflammatory responses and prevent/attenuate carcinogenesis .
Chronic inflammation , increased reactivity to self-antigens and incidences of cancer are hallmarks of aging . However , the underlying mechanisms are not well understood . Age-associated alterations in the DNA either due to oxidative damage , defects in DNA repair or epigenetic modifications such as methylation that lead to mutations and changes in the expression of genes are thought to be partially responsible . Here we report that epigenetic modifications in aged DNA also increase its immunogenicity rendering it more reactive to innate immune system cells such as the dendritic cells . We observed increased upregulation of costimulatory molecules as well as enhanced secretion of IFN-alpha from dendritic cells in response to DNA from aged donors as compared to DNA from young donors when it was delivered intracellularly via Lipofectamine . Investigations into the mechanisms revealed that DNA from aged subjects is not degraded , neither is it more damaged compared to DNA from young subjects . However , there is significantly decreased global level of methylation suggesting that age-associated hypomethylation of the DNA may be the cause of its increased immunogenicity . Increased immunogenicity of self DNA may thus be another mechanism that may contribute to the increase in age-associated chronic inflammation , autoimmunity and cancer .
Polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) are ubiquitous contaminants in the marine environment . Their toxicity is mainly linked to the ability of marine species to biotransform them into reactive metabolites . PAHs are thus often detected at trace levels in animal tissues . For biomonitoring purposes , this findings have two main consequences , ( i ) the determination of the PAH tissue concentration is not suitable for the evaluation of individual exposure to PAHs ( ii ) it can explain sometimes the lack of correlations obtained with relevant markers of toxicity such as genotoxicity biomarkers . The aim of the present study was to better investigate the link between PAH exposure and genotoxicity in marine flatfish . During a laboratory experiment , juvenile soles were exposed for four weeks to a mixture of three PAHs , namely benzo[a]pyrene , fluoranthene and pyrene , followed by one week of depuration . Fish were exposed via the trophic route to a daily PAH concentration of 120 mug/g food . Fish were sampled at different time points . The bioavailability and the biotransformation of PAHs were assessed by the measurement of biliary metabolites using a sensitive UPLC MS/MS method . The 7-ethoxyresorufine-O-deethylase was also measured in liver subcellular fractions as a biomarker of phase I biotransformation activities . Genotoxicity was assessed in parallel by the measurement of DNA strand breaks in fish erythrocytes by the alkaline comet assay . During this study , the high amount of PAH metabolites produced in sole demonstrated the bioavailability of PAHs and their biotransformation by fish enzymes . A positive correlation was observed between the level of hydroxylated PAH metabolites and genotoxicity as measured by the alkaline comet assay .
Oxazaphosphorines are a class of DNA alkylating agents . The aim of the present study was to compare the possible influence of three new generation oxazaphosphorines , D-17272 ( mafosfamide cyclohexylamine salt ) , D-18864 ( 4-hydro-peroxy-cyclophosphamide ) , and D-19575 ( glufosfamide , beta-D-glucose-isophosphoramide mustard ) on DNA damage induction in the human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells . The flow cytometry APO-BRDU assay , based on the TUNEL method , was used for the in situ detection of DNA strand breaks . After exposure of U937 cells to the oxazaphosphorines , the patterns of temporary changes in the frequency of TUNEL positive U937 cells , expressing DNA breakage , were determined . The effects of the oxazaphosphorines on U937 cells were dependent on the agent tested and its dose , and the time intervals after the drug application . The different potential of D-17272 , D-18864 and D-19575 to induce DNA strand breakage in the human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells was shown .
Squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) is the most frequent cancer in organ transplant recipients ( OTRs ) . The immune system plays a major role in the fight against SCC , however , little is known about the local inflammatory response in SCC at all . We analyzed quantity and quality of the perineoplastic inflammatory SCC microenvironment in immunocompetent patients and immmunosuppressed OTRs . RNA expression profile of SCC patients was analyzed for 8 different sets of genes relating to Th1 versus Th2 response using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis . SCC from immunocompetent patients and OTRs were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reactions for CD4 , CD8 , TBET , GATA-3 , FOXP3 , RORC , IFN-gamma , IL-4 , TGF-beta , IL-10 , and IL-17A mRNA expression . Immunohistochemistry was carried out in SCC for CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , and FOXP3 expression . Considerable inflammation was seen in both patient groups . SCC in immunocompetent patients and OTRs was associated with a mixed Th1 and Th2 gene expression signature . CD4(+) mRNA was diminished in immunosuppression . Skin adjacent to SCC in OTRs showed Th2 expression pattern as compared with immunocompetent patients . T-BET and IFN-gamma mRNA expression were decreased in the OTR group . Although Th17-weighted inflammation was unchanged , IL-17A mRNA level was markedly decreased with immunosuppression . Regulatory T cells , characterized by FOX-P3 and TGF-beta mRNA level , were decreased in OTRs . Our findings support the hypothesis that nontumor-bearing skin adjacent to SCC in OTRs is not necessarily normal and that the local microenvironment may contribute to a field effect contributing to higher recurrence rates and more aggressive behavior observed in these patients .
Regulation of adaptive immunity by innate immune cells is widely accepted . Conversely , adaptive immune cells can also regulate cells of the innate immune system . Here , we report for the first time the essential role of B cells in regulating macrophage ( Mphi ) phenotype . In vitro B cell/Mphi co-culture experiments together with experiments in transgenic mice models for B-cell deficiency or overexpression showed B1 cells to polarize Mphi to a distinct phenotype . This was characterized by downregulated TNF-alpha , IL-1beta and CCL3 , but upregulated IL-10 upon LPS stimulation ; constitutive expression of M2 Mphi markers ( e.g . Ym1 , Fizz1 ) and overexpression of TRIF-dependent cytokines ( IFN-beta , CCL5 ) . Mechanistically , this phenotype was linked to a defective NF-kappaB activation , but a functional TRIF/STAT1 pathway . B1-cell-derived IL-10 was found to be instrumental in the polarization of these Mphi . Finally , in vivo relevance of B1-cell-induced Mphi polarization was confirmed using the B16 melanoma tumor model where adoptive transfer of B1 cells induced an M2 polarization of tumor-associated Mphi . Collectively , our results define a new mechanism of Mphi polarization wherein B1 cells play a key role in driving Mphi to a unique , but M2-biased phenotype . Future studies along these lines may lead to targeting of B1 cells to regulate Mphi response in inflammation and cancer .
BACKGROUND The immune system plays an important role in the multifactorial biologic system during the development of neoplasias . However , the involvement of the inflammatory response in the promotion/control of malignant cells is still controversial , and the cell subsets and the mechanisms involved are poorly investigated . The goal of this study was to characterize the clinical-pathological status and the immunophenotyping profile of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and their association with the animal survival rates in canine mammary carcinomas . METHODS Fifty-one animals with mammary carcinomas , classified as carcinomas in mixed tumors-MC-BMT = 31 and carcinomas-MC = 20 were submitted to systematic clinical-pathological analysis ( tumor size ; presence of lymph node and pulmonary metastasis ; clinical stage ; histological grade ; inflammatory distribution and intensity as well as the lymphocytic infiltrate intensity ) and survival rates . Twenty-four animals ( MC-BMT = 16 and MC = 8 ) were elected to the immunophenotypic study performed by flow cytometry . RESULTS Data analysis demonstrated that clinical stage II-IV and histological grade was I more frequent in MC-BMT as compared to MC . Univariate analysis demonstrated that the intensity of inflammation ( moderate/intense ) and the proportion of CD4+ ( > or = 66.7% ) or CD8+ T-cells ( <33.3% ) were not associated with worse survival rate . Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only lymphocytic infiltrate intensity > or = 600 ( P = 0.02 ) remained as independent prognostic factor . Despite the clinical manifestation , the lymphocytes represented the predominant cell type in the tumor infiltrate . The percentage of T-cells was higher in animals with MC-BMT without metastasis , while the percentage of B-lymphocytes was greater in animals with metastasized MC-BMT ( P < 0.05 ) . The relative percentage of CD4+ T-cells was significantly greater in metastasized tumors ( both MC-BMT and MC ) , ( P < 0.05 ) while the proportion of CD8+ T-cells was higher in MC-BMT without metastasis . Consequently , the CD4+/CD8+ ratio was significantly increased in both groups with metastasis . Regardless of the tumor type , the animals with high proportions of CD4+ and low CD8+ T-cells had decreased survival rates . CONCLUSION The intensity of lymphocytic infiltrate and probably the relative abundance of the CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes may represent important survival prognostic biomarkers for canine mammary carcinomas .
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( IDO ) is generally considered to be immunosuppressive but recent findings suggest this characterization oversimplifies its role in disease pathogenesis . Recently , we showed that IDO is essential for tumor outgrowth in the classical two-stage model of inflammatory skin carcinogenesis . Here , we report that IDO loss did not exacerbate classical inflammatory responses . Rather , IDO induction could be elicited by environmental signals and tumor promoters as an integral component of the inflammatory tissue microenvironment even in the absence of cancer . IDO loss had limited impact on tumor outgrowth in carcinogenesis models that lacked an explicit inflammatory tumor promoter . In the context of inflammatory carcinogenesis where IDO was critical to tumor development , the most important source of IDO was radiation-resistant non-hematopoietic cells , consistent with evidence that loss of the IDO regulatory tumor suppressor gene Bin1 in transformed skin cells facilitates IDO-mediated immune escape by a cell autonomous mechanism . Taken together , our results identify IDO as an integral component of ' cancer-associated ' inflammation that tilts the immune system toward tumor support . More generally , they promote the concept that mediators of immune escape and cancer-associated inflammation may be genetically synonymous .
The main objective of the present investigation was to study the urinary neopterin excretion in the context of the activation of the adaptive cellular immune system at the tumor site . For this purpose , we compared pre-treatment urinary neopterin levels measured in 92 ovarian cancer patients , with intratumoral levels of mRNA transcripts from factors either involved in the adaptive antitumor immune defense ( CD3 , IFN-gamma , IRF-1 , IRF-2 , SOCS1 and iNOS ) or immune tolerance ( FoxP3 ) . This study did not reveal an association between urinary neopterin and one of these investigated " on tumor site transcripts " . From all the factors reflecting the magnitude of the local adaptive antitumor response , intratumoral IRF-1 expression above the edge of the 25th percentile was found to predict most reliably favorable progression-free ( median 34 months vs. 10 months ; p < 0.001 ) and overall ( median 52 months vs. 16 months ; p < 0.001 ) survival . In contrast , pre-treatment urinary neopterin excretion above 275 mumol/mol creatinine , which indicates an unspecific activation of the innate immune system , was associated with a very poor overall survival with a median of only 11 months when compared with a median overall survival of 40 months in patients with lower urinary neopterin excretion ( p = 0.021 ) . Interestingly , the considerable survival benefit in patients with high IRF-1-expressing cancers was completely abrogated as well for progression-free as for overall survival when urinary neopterin concentrations were found to be concomitantly elevated . These findings demonstrate that in ovarian carcinomas the unspecific " cancer-related inflammation " contributes to a significant subversion of the adaptive antitumor immune defense mounted at the tumor site .
PURPOSE Idarubicin is a synthetic anthracycline anticancer drug widely used in the treatment of some hematological malignancies . The studies in our laboratory have clearly demonstrated that idarubicin can undergo reductive bioactivation by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase to free radicals with resulting formation of DNA strand breaks , which can potentially contribute to its genotoxic effects [ Celik , H. , Arinc , E. , Bioreduction of idarubicin and formation of ROS responsible for DNA cleavage by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and its potential role in the antitumor effect . J Pharm Pharm Sci , 11(4):68-82 , 2008 ] . In the current study , our aim was to investigate the possible protective effects of several phenolic antioxidants , quercetin , rutin , naringenin , resveratrol and trolox , against the DNA-damaging effect of idarubicin originating from its P450 reductase-catalyzed bioactivation . METHODS DNA damage was measured by detecting single-strand breaks in plasmid pBR322 DNA using a cell-free agarose gel method . RESULTS Our results indicated that , among the compounds tested , quercetin was the most potent antioxidant in preventing DNA damage . Quercetin significantly decreased the extent of DNA strand breaks in a dose-dependent manner ; 100 microM of quercetin almost completely inhibited the DNA strand breakage . Unlike quercetin , its glycosidated conjugate rutin , failed to provide any significant protection against idarubicin-induced DNA strand breaks except at the highest concentration tested ( 2 mM ) . The protective effects of other antioxidants were significantly less than that of quercetin even at high concentrations . Quercetin was found to be also an effective protector against DNA damage induced by mitomycin C. CONCLUSION We conclude that quercetin , one of the most abundant flavonoids in the human diet , is highly effective in reducing the DNA damage caused by the antitumor agents , idarubicin and mitomycin C , following bioactivation by P450 reductase .
Ultraviolet ( UV ) light induces DNA-damage checkpoints and mutagenesis , which are involved in cancer protection and tumorigenesis , respectively . How cells identify DNA lesions and convert them to checkpoint-activating structures is a major question . We show that during repair of UV lesions in noncycling cells , Exo1-mediated processing of nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) intermediates competes with repair DNA synthesis . Impediments of the refilling reaction allow Exo1 to generate extended ssDNA gaps , detectable by electron microscopy , which drive Mec1 kinase activation and will be refilled by long-patch repair synthesis , as shown by DNA combing . We provide evidence that this mechanism maybe stimulated by closely opposing UV lesions , represents a strategy to redirect problematic repair intermediates to alternative repair pathways , and may also be extended to physically different DNA damages . Our work has significant implications for understanding the coordination between repair of DNA lesions and checkpoint pathways to preserve genome stability .
Landmark studies of the status of DNA damage checkpoints and associated repair functions in preneoplastic and neoplastic cells has focused attention on importance of these pathways in cancer development , and inhibitors of repair pathways are in clinical trials for treatment of triple negative breast cancer . Cancer heterogeneity suggests that specific cancer subtypes will have distinct mechanisms of DNA damage survival , dependent on biological context . In this study , status of DNA damage response ( DDR)-associated proteins was examined in breast cancer subtypes in association with clinical features ; 479 breast cancers were examined for expression of DDR proteins gammaH2AX , BRCA1 , pChk2 , and p53 , DNA damage-sensitive tumor suppressors Fhit and Wwox , and Wwox-interacting proteins Ap2alpha , Ap2gamma , ErbB4 , and correlations among proteins , tumor subtypes , and clinical features were assessed . In a multivariable model , triple negative cancers showed significantly reduced Fhit and Wwox , increased p53 and Ap2gamma protein expression , and were significantly more likely than other subtype tumors to exhibit aberrant expression of two or more DDR-associated proteins . Disease-free survival was associated with subtype , Fhit and membrane ErbB4 expression level and aberrant expression of multiple DDR-associated proteins . These results suggest that definition of specific DNA repair and checkpoint defects in subgroups of triple negative cancer might identify new treatment targets . Expression of Wwox and its interactor , ErbB4 , was highly significantly reduced in metastatic tissues vs. matched primary tissues , suggesting that Wwox signal pathway loss contributes to lymph node metastasis , perhaps by allowing survival of tumor cells that have detached from basement membranes , as proposed for the role of Wwox in ovarian cancer spread .
BACKGROUND Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) has efficiently adapted to its host and establishes a persistent infection characterized by low levels of viral gene expression and slow proliferation of HTLV-I infected cells over decades . We have previously found that HTLV-I p30 is a negative regulator of virus expression . RESULTS In this study we show that p30 targets multiple cell cycle checkpoints resulting in a delayed entry into S phase . We found that p30 binds to cyclin E and CDK2 and prevents the formation of active cyclin E-CDK2 complexes . In turn , this decreases the phosphorylation levels of Rb and prevents the release of E2F and its transcriptional activation of genes required for G1/S transition . Our studies also show that HTLV-II p28 does not bind cyclin E and does not affect cell cycle progression . CONCLUSIONS In contrast to HTLV-I , the HTLV-II-related retrovirus is not oncogenic in humans . Here we report that the HTLV-I p30 delays cell cycle progression while its homologue , HTLV-II p28 , does not , providing evidence for important differences between these two related retrovirus proteins .
The role of estrogen receptor beta ( ERbeta ) in breast cancer is unclear . ERbeta is considered to have a protective role in breast cancer development based on findings demonstrating that ERbeta expression inhibits ERalpha-mediated proliferation of breast cancer cells . We previously demonstrated that ERbeta causes a ligand independent G2 cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells . To study the mechanisms of the ERbeta-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest , we investigated its effects on the regulatory pathways responsible for the G2/M phase transition . We found that ERbeta inhibits CDK1 activity , which is the critical determinant of the G2/M progression . CDK1 activity is modulated by both stimulatory and inhibitory factors . Cyclin B1 is the major activator of CDK1 . ERbeta inhibited the cell cycle-dependent stimulation of cyclin B1 mRNA and protein . GADD45A and BTG2 are two major inhibitors of CDK1 , which have been implicated in breast tumor formation . Based on these findings , we explored if the expression pattern of GADD45A and BTG2 is affected by ERbeta . We found that ERbeta stimulates GADD45A and BTG2 mRNA levels . The induction of these two genes is caused by ERbeta binding directly to these genes and recruiting c-jun and NCOA2 . Our findings demonstrated that unliganded ERbeta causes a G2 cell cycle arrest by inactivating CDK1 through the repression of cyclin B1 and stimulation of GADD45A and BTG2 expression . These results provide evidence that drugs that stimulate the production of unliganded ERbeta may be effective new therapies to prevent breast cancer .
Heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) is a molecular chaperone involved in folding and stabilizing multiple intracellular proteins that have roles in cell activation and proliferation . Many Hsp90 client proteins in tumor cells are mutated or overexpressed oncogenic proteins driving cancer cell growth , leading to the acceptance of Hsp90 as a potential therapeutic target for cancer . Because several signal transduction molecules that are dependent on Hsp90 function are also involved in activation of innate and adaptive cells of the immune system , we investigated the mechanism by which inhibiting Hsp90 leads to therapeutic efficacy in rodent models of inflammation and autoimmunity . EC144 , a synthetic Hsp90 inhibitor , blocked LPS-induced TLR4 signaling in RAW 264.7 cells by inhibiting activation of ERK1/2 , MEK1/2 , JNK , and p38 MAPK but not NF-kappaB . Ex vivo LPS-stimulated CD11b(+) peritoneal exudate cells from EC144-treated mice were blocked from phosphorylating tumor progression locus 2 , MEK1/2 , and ERK1/2 . Consequently , EC144-treated mice were resistant to LPS administration and had suppressed systemic TNF-alpha release . Inhibiting Hsp90 also blocked in vitro CD4(+) T cell proliferation in mouse and human MLRs . In vivo , semitherapeutic administration of EC144 blocked disease development in rat collagen-induced arthritis by suppressing the inflammatory response . In a mouse collagen-induced arthritis model , EC144 also suppressed disease development , which correlated with a suppressed Ag-specific Ab response and a block in activation of Ag-specific CD4(+) T cells . Our results describe mechanisms by which blocking Hsp90 function may be applicable to treatment of autoimmune diseases involving inflammation and activation of the adaptive immune response .
Maintenance of genomic integrity is essential for adult tissue homeostasis and defects in the DNA-damage response ( DDR ) machinery are linked to numerous pathologies including cancer . Here , we present evidence that the DDR exerts tumor suppressor activity in gliomas . We show that genes encoding components of the DDR pathway are frequently altered in human gliomas and that loss of elements of the ATM/Chk2/p53 cascade accelerates tumor formation in a glioma mouse model . We demonstrate that Chk2 is required for glioma response to ionizing radiation in vivo and is necessary for DNA-damage checkpoints in the neuronal stem cell compartment . Finally , we observed that the DDR is constitutively activated in a subset of human GBMs , and such activation correlates with regions of hypoxia .
DNA damage checkpoints in the cell cycle may be important barriers against cancer progression in human cells . Fanconi anemia ( FA ) is an inherited DNA instability disorder that is associated with bone marrow failure and a strong predisposition to cancer . Although FA cells experience constitutive chromosomal breaks , cell cycle arrest at the G2 DNA damage checkpoint , and an excess of cell death , some patients do become clinically stable , and the mechanisms underlying this , other than spontaneous reversion of the disease-causing mutation , are not well understood . Here we have defined a clonal phenotype , termed attenuation , in which FA patients acquire an abrogation of the G2 checkpoint arrest . Attenuated cells expressed lower levels of CHK1 ( also known as CHEK1 ) and p53 . The attenuation could be recapitulated by modulating the ATR/CHK1 pathway , and CHK1 inhibition protected FA cells from cell death . FA patients who expressed the attenuated phenotype had mild bone marrow deficiency and reached adulthood , but several of them eventually developed myelodysplasia or leukemia . Better understanding of attenuation might help predict a patient's clinical course and guide choice of treatment . Our results also highlight the importance of evaluating the cellular DNA damage checkpoint and repair pathways in cancer therapies in general .
Cyclin-dependent kinases are most extensively studied targets for cancer chemotherapy since the tumor cells exhibit false checkpoints and can proliferate even if the genome is compromised . Cyclin-dependent kinases ensure the tight regulation of the cell cycle execution by mediating phosphorylation of cellular proteins . Deregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity by cellular and external factors leads to many diseases like cancers . Different methods like radiolabeled , fluorescence and luminescence are available for screening of library of compounds against kinases . However , bioluminescent methods offer several advantages like low background and no effect of fluorescent compound interference . Present study is focused on development , optimization and validation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 assay which is suitable for identification potent and selective , ATP competitive and non-competitive inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 . The aim of present investigation was to optimize the assay for cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cylin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E with use of bioluminescence based biochemical reaction . Both cyclin-dependent kinase 2 which are cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E complexes , have different affinity for ATP . Therefore , both isoform analogs of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 were optimized separately . Optimum cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E concentration were found to be 250 ng/well and 200 ng/well , respectively . Optimum substrate ( histone H1 ) concentration was found to be 2.5 mg/ml for both cyclin-dependent kinase 2 analogs . Optimum reaction time was found to be 20 min for both cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin complexes .
