We have observed previously that treatment of plateau-phase L5178Y murine lymphoblasts in vitro with 2'-deoxycoformycin plus deoxyadenosine ( dCF/dAdo ) can inhibit the repair of X-irradiation-induced DNA single-strand breaks ( SSB ) in these cells and that this effect is associated with synergistic cell kill . In this study we examined the effect of a combination treatment of plateau-phase L5178Y cells with bleomycin ( BLM ) plus dCF/dAdo . Incubation of BLM-treated cells with dCF/dAdo resulted in significant inhibition of the repair of BLM-induced DNA SSB . However , an additive , but not a synergistic , increase in cell kill was observed when cells were treated with a combination of BLM plus dCF/dAdo .
Apoptosis , programmed cell death , was previously shown to be induced by the mAb anti-APO-1 ( IgG3 , kappa ) by binding to the APO-1 cell surface Ag , a new member of the nerve growth factor/TNF receptor superfamily . To investigate the role of the Ig H chain Fc regions we compared induction of apoptosis by the original mAb IgG3 anti-APO-1 with anti-APO-1 F(ab')2 fragments and different anti-APO-1 isotypes ( IgG1 , IgG2b , IgG2a , and IgA ) isolated by sequential sublining . We found that IgG3 was the most active isotype ; IgG1 , IgG2a , and IgA showed intermediate activity , and IgG2b and F(ab')2 were inactive . Cytotoxic activity of the inactive or less active antibody preparations was fully reconstituted by protein A , anti-mouse Ig , or anti-mouse Ig F(ab')2 , respectively . Thus , APO-1-mediated induction of apoptosis was dependent on efficient cross-linking of APO-1 cell surface Ag , indirectly augmented by anti-APO-1 Fc-Fc self-aggregation . Because of their different in vitro activity we selected IgG3- , IgG2b- , and IgA anti-APO-1 to test their antitumor activity against solid human B lymphoblastoid tumors in SCID mice . The isotypes showed a different serum half-life ( IgG3 : 9.2-10.4 days , IgG2b : 1.9-2.6 days , and IgA : 14.1-29.2 h ) and a different initial tumor localization 4 h after i.p. injection ( IgG3 around the blood vessels , IgG2b homogeneously , and IgA heterogeneously distributed in the tumor ) . All antibody preparations induced tumor regression by induction of apoptosis , even IgG2b anti-APO-1 inactive in vitro without cross-linking . The activity of IgA anti-APO-1 , which did not mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity indicates that apoptosis may be used as the main if not the only mechanism of induction of tumor regression in vivo . As with in vitro , IgG3 anti-APO-1 was the most effective isotype also in vivo . This result suggests that cross-linking of APO-1 on the tumor cell surface may also be required for tumor regression by apoptosis in vivo . Taken together , our data show that selective targeting of apoptosis to tumors may be an efficient antitumor mechanism .
Gamma-radiation , tetrandrine , bistratene A , and cisplatin were all found to induce pronounced morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis and extensive DNA fragmentation in the human BM13674 cell line 8 h after treatment . Apoptosis induced in BM13674 cells by these diverse agents was markedly inhibited by 1 microM okadaic acid , a tumour promoter that inhibits protein phosphatases 1 and 2A . This compound also inhibited the appearance of apoptosis in fresh human leukaemia cells that had been exposed to gamma-radiation . The inhibition of apoptosis was confirmed using fluorescence microscopy and DNA gel electrophoresis . Dephosphorylation of a limited number of proteins was shown to be associated with apoptosis and okadaic acid prevented these dephosphorylations . Previous studies on the BM13674 cell line showed that an inhibitor of protein synthesis failed to prevent apoptosis in these cells . The present data provides further support that posttranslational modification of proteins , in particular , phosphorylation/dephosphorylation status , plays an important role in inhibition/activation of programmed cell death in different human cells after exposure to several cytotoxic agents .
Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) of hepatic tumours has been restricted owing to the preferential retention of photosensitizers in liver tissue . We therefore investigated interstitial tumour illumination as a means of selective PDT . A piece of colon carcinoma CC531 was implanted in the liver of Wag/Rij rats . Photofrin was administered ( 5 mg kg-1 i.v. ) 2 days before laser illumination . Tumours with a mean ( +/- s.e. ) diameter of 5.7 +/- 0.1 mm ( n = 106 , 20 days after implantation ) were illuminated with 625 nm light , at 200 mW cm-1 from a 0.5 cm cylindrical diffuser and either 100 , 200 , 400 , 800 or 1600 J cm-1 . Control groups received either laser illumination only , Photofrin only or diffuser insertion only . Short-term effects were studied on the second day after illumination by light microscopy and computer-assisted integration of the circumference of damaged areas . Long-term effects were studied on day 36 . To determine the biochemistry of liver damage and function , serum ASAT and ALAT levels were measured on day 1 and 2 , and antipyrine clearance on day 1 . Tumour and surrounding liver necrosis increased with light dose delivered ( P < 0.001 ) . Best long-term results were obtained at 800 J cm-1 with complete tumour remission in 4 out of 6 animals . No deterioration in liver function was found . The results of this study show the ability of interstitial PDT to cause major destruction of tumour tissue in the liver combined with minimal liver damage .
The purpose of this study was to generate a selective radiosensitising effect by the intra-hepatic-arterial infusion of misonidazole ( MISO ) . MISO ( 10 mg ) was infused after transcatheter hepatic-arterial embolisation into the livers of rabbits bearing VX2 liver cancer . This procedure was followed by 15 Gy electron irradiation . Evaluation of tumour volume and histological examination was carried out on the 7th day after treatment . The greatest tumour response was obtained in the group which received MISO followed by radiation and was characterised by extensive fibrosis around the tumour and nearly complete tumour necrosis . Liver cell regeneration was also noted in adjacent liver tissue . The advantages of regional infusion of MISO following hepatic-arterial embolisation are : ( 1 ) Selectivity increased radiosensitivity of liver cancer alongside very low drug concentration in the plasma . ( 2 ) Reduced or absent deleterious side effects of MISO with higher tumour/normal tissue ratios of drug concentration . ( 3 ) Reduced cost due to the lower dosage of MISO required for regional infusion .
Nine primary pulmonary carcinomas , one metastatic carcinoma , and two malignant pleural mesotheliomas have been analysed for the expression at the mRNA level of metalloproteinases ( MPs ) and tissue inhibitors of MPs ( TIMPs ) . In situ hybridisation showed TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 transcripts predominantly over tumour stroma and gelatinases evenly distributed over both stromal and tumour cells . While both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were expressed in non-neoplastic lungs ( NNL ) as well as in carcinomas , stromelysin 3 ( ST3 ) , 92 kDa gelatinase and interstitial collagenase were expressed only by carcinomas . Expression of these MPs by carcinomas was independent of histologic type and such tumour features as fibrosis or necrosis . The consistent expression of ST3 by all of the carcinomas examined and absence of its expression in NNL indicates that ST3 production is likely associated with the malignant phenotype . However , since 92 kDa gelatinase and interstitial collagenase transcripts were found in some but not all tumour samples , their expression is not a uniform feature of pulmonary carcinomas . The possible prognostic significance of the expression of the latter two enzymes by carcinomas remains to be established .
Studies were performed to test the hypothesis that urethane-induced murine lung tumors exhibit xenobiotic resistance and alterations in pulmonary cytochrome P-450 enzymes. 1,1-Dichloroethylene , naphthalene , and paraquat were administered to tumor-bearing and control mice to elicit acute lung cytotoxicity , and responses were evaluated in tumors ( papillary and solid ) , uninvolved surrounding tissue , and untreated control lung. 1,1-Dichloroethylene ( 125 mg/kg , i.p. ) and naphthalene ( 225 mg/kg , i.p. ) caused preferential necrosis of Clara cells in control lungs and uninvolved tissue of tumor-bearing lungs . In contrast , papillary and solid tumors were both resistant to 1,1-dichloroethylene-induced cytotoxicity . Paraquat ( 10 , 20 mg/kg , i.v. ) elicited Clara cell damage in control lungs and uninvolved lung tissue of tumor-bearing mice , with minor disruption of the alveolar epithelium . Neither papillary nor solid tumors sustained any apparent cell damage from paraquat . Immunoblots of P-450 enzymes confirmed constitutive expression of CYP2B1 in control lung and uninvolved lung tissue of tumor-bearing mice , but this P-450 enzyme was not detected in either adenomas or carcinomas . Lung CYP1A1 was inducible by beta-naphthoflavone in non-tumor-bearing mice and uninvolved tissue of tumor-bearing mice ; however , inducibility was decreased in adenomas and abolished in carcinomas . These results demonstrate resistance of lung tumor cells to chemically induced cytotoxicity and diminished expression of cytochrome P-450 enzymes in tumors .
Thirty-five cases of clear cell sarcoma of soft tissues were studied to determine the clinical or morphologic features that are important in predicting prognosis . Tumors occurred most commonly in the extremities , and the majority of the patients were young women . Surgery was the elected treatment in every case . Five patients experienced local recurrences , and metastases developed in 22 . Fifty-four percent of the patients died of tumor , 11% are alive with disease , and the remaining 34% are alive and well ; the average survival for each group was 67 months , 113 months , and 103.5 months , respectively . This sarcoma is characterized by small clusters of polygonal to spindle cells featuring clear to slightly basophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli . The clusters are separated by delicate fibrous septa . In a deletion , clear cell sarcoma has low mitotic activity , little or no necrosis , and mild nuclear pleomorphism . Tumor size and the presence of necrosis are statistically significant predictors of prognosis . All 12 patients with tumors measuring > 5 cm died of disease or are alive with disease . Eleven of the 20 patients with tumors measuring < 5 cm are alive with no evidence of disease . Tumor necrosis was present in 10 cases ; eight of these patients died of disease and one is alive with disseminated metastases .
The induction of apoptosis by glucocorticoids in isolated thymocytes has been studied extensively . However , it is not known whether or not the same changes occur after in vivo glucocorticoid treatment . In order to investigate this , we have studied the changes occurring in thymocytes isolated from rats , from 2-24 hr after a dose of dexamethasone ( 1 mg/kg ) , which caused 50% thymic atrophy . Thymocytes were separated into four fractions by isopycnic Percoll gradients . A loss of cells occurred within 2-8 hr , primarily in only one of the two major fractions of normal thymocytes . This loss of normal thymocytes coincided with the appearance of small dense cells with characteristic features of apoptosis including condensed chromatin , increased DNA fragmentation , internucleosomal DNA cleavage and a " hypodiploid " peak on flow cytometric analysis . Striking differences occurred in the cellular composition of the different Percoll fractions with time . Initially ( up to 4 hr ) , the pattern of changes occurring in vivo resembled those found in vitro . However , at later times , the complex fate of apoptotic cells in vivo , such as phagocytosis , are not observed in the in vitro studies .
We compared gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ( Gd-DTPA ) enhanced T1-weighted images ( T1-Gd ) with the histopathological findings in 13 patients with bone or soft tissue sarcomas . Signal intensity of the viable tumor tissue was increased in T1-Gd in 92% of the patients . The necrotic or cystic areas in the tumor were not enhanced , rendering them distinctly . The degree of enhancement of the edematous area around the tumor was similar to or more marked than that of the tumor in 54% of the patients . Area showing inflammatory cells infiltration and edematous areas in the tumor tissue were also enhanced . Thus , the effect of preoperative chemotherapy in tumor tissues other than necrotic and cystic areas tended to be underestimated in T1-Gd . Its effect should be comprehensively evaluated based on not only T1-Gd but also T2-weighted images and findings of other imaging techniques .
The protein toxins ricin , abrin , Shiga toxin , and diphtheria toxin were found to induce lysis of several cell lines in a manner characteristic for programmed cell death or apoptosis . The toxins induced DNA degradation , and light and electron microscopical studies revealed that lysis was preceded by reorganization of intracellular vacuoles , cell blebbing , and chromatin condensation both in Vero and in MDCK cells . Cell lysis was efficiently inhibited by cycloheximide and 3-methyladenine ( 3MA ) , a specific inhibitor of autophagy . Cycloheximide , which like 3MA inhibits autophagy , protected even when added at a time when the protein synthesis had been blocked by ricin , suggesting that the effect of cycloheximide on cell lysis is independent of its ability to inhibit protein synthesis . Also theophylline and dibutyryl-cGMP had some protective effect , whereas a number of compounds reported to protect against apoptosis in other systems were without protective effects . The data suggest that autophagy is important for the toxin-induced cell lysis .
PURPOSE The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 ( Iressa ; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals , Alderley Park , United Kingdom ) is under development as an anticancer agent . We studied the pharmacodynamic effects of ZD1839 on EGFR in the skin , an EGFR-dependent tissue , in cancer patients participating in ZD1839 phase I clinical trials . PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied 104 pre- and/or on-ZD1839 therapy ( approximately at day 28 of therapy ) skin biopsies from 65 patients receiving escalating doses of daily oral ZD1839 . We measured ZD1839 effects on EGFR activation by immunohistochemistry using an antibody specific for the activated ( phosphorylated ) EGFR . Effects on receptor signaling ( activated mitogen-activated protein kinase [ MAPK] ) , proliferation , p27(KIP1) , and maturation were also assessed . RESULTS Histopathologically , the stratum corneum of the epidermis was thinner during therapy ( P <.001 ) . In hair follicles , prominent keratin plugs and microorganisms were found in dilated infundibula . ZD1839 suppressed EGFR phosphorylation in all EGFR-expressing cells ( P <.001 ) . In addition , ZD1839 inhibited MAPK activation ( P <.001 ) and reduced keratinocyte proliferation index ( P <.001 ) . Concomitantly , ZD1839 increased the expression of p27(KIP1) ( P <.001 ) and maturation markers ( P <.001 ) and increased apoptosis ( P <.001 ) . These effects were observed at all dose levels , before reaching dose-limiting toxicities . CONCLUSION ZD1839 inhibits EGFR activation and affects downstream receptor-dependent processes in vivo . These effects were profound at doses well below the one producing unacceptable toxicity , a finding that strongly supports pharmacodynamic assessments to select optimal doses instead of a maximum-tolerated dose for definitive efficacy and safety trials .
The secretion of immunosuppressive factors like transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) by tumor cells has been recognized as one of the mechanisms involved in tumor immunological escape . This study aimed to examine whether dendritic cell ( DC ) immunization could reverse TGF-beta-induced immunosuppression by simulating the in vivo interaction among infused DCs , host T cells , and tumor-secreted TGF-beta in an in vitro study . We found that both immature and mature DCs were relatively resistant to TGF-beta . The addition of TGF-beta to naive human CD4+ T cells , which are required by genetically modified DC to elicit antitumor immunity , resulted in their hyporesponsiveness to DC stimulation in a dose-dependent manner . When activated by allogeneic DCs in the presence of TGF-beta , CD4+ T cells displayed a reduced capacity to proliferate . More importantly , activated CD4+ T cells induced by DC stimulation were very sensitive to TGF-beta , and this susceptibility was enhanced by their previous exposure to TGF-beta . The underlying mechanism was linked to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis of activated T cells . However , the presence of stimulation from DC or antibodies to CD3 plus CD28 could partly reverse the immunosuppressive effect of TGF-beta on activated CD4+ T cells . Taken together , our results indicate that the efficacy of DC immunization may be impaired by tumor-derived TGF-beta .
Treatment of cells with the anti-cancer drug camptothecin ( CPT ) induces topoisomerase I ( Top1)-mediated DNA damage , which in turn affects cell proliferation and survival . In this report , we demonstrate that treatment of the wild-type HCT116 ( wt HCT116 ) human colon cancer cell line and the isogenic p53(-/-) HCT116 and p21(-/-) HCT116 cell lines with a high concentration ( 250 nm ) of CPT resulted in apoptosis , indicating that apoptosis occurred by a p53- and p21-independent mechanism . In contrast , treatment with a low concentration ( 20 nm ) of CPT induced cell cycle arrest and senescence of the wt HCT116 cells , but apoptosis of the p53(-/-) HCT116 and p21(-/-) HCT116 cells . Further investigations indicated that p53-dependent expression of p21 blocked apoptosis of wt HCT116 cells treated with 20 nm , but not 250 nm CPT . Interestingly , blocking of the apoptotic pathway , by Z-VAD-FMK , in p21(-/-) HCT116 cells following treatment with 20 nm CPT did not permit the cells to develop properties of senescence . These observations demonstrated that p21 was required for senescence development of HCT116 cells following treatment with low concentrations of CPT .
OBJECTIVE To elucidate the direct effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist ( GnRHa ) on the growth of human uterine leiomyoma cells , cell proliferation and apoptosis in cultured leiomyoma cells treated with GnRHa were investigated . METHODS Isolated leiomyoma cells were subcultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 5 days and stepped down to serum-free conditions for an additional 6 days in the presence or absence of graded concentrations of GnRHa ( 10(-9) mol/l to 10(-12) mol/l ) . The effects of GnRHa on the number of viable cells , expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) , Fas and Fas ligand , and apoptosis in cultured leiomyoma cells were examined by MTT ( 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrasodium bromide ) assay , immunocytochemical analysis , Western blot analysis and TUNEL assay respectively . RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of GnRH receptor mRNA in cultured leiomyoma cells . RESULTS Treatment with GnRHa resulted in a decrease in the number of cultured viable leiomyoma cells assessed by MTT assay in a dose-dependent manner compared with that in control cultures ( P<0.01 ) . The growth inhibition of cultured leiomyoma cells treated with GnRHa in concentrations higher than 10(-10) mol/l was associated with the suppression of the proliferative potential characterized by a decrease in PCNA-positive rate of the cultured cells ( P<0.01 ) and an increase in the apoptosis-positive rate assessed by TUNEL assay ( P<0.05 and P<0.01 ) . GnRHa markedly increased the expression of Fas and induced the expression of Fas ligand in the cultured leiomyoma cells on the basis of Western blot analysis . These direct effects of GnRHa on the number of viable cultured leiomyoma cells , PCNA-positive rate , apoptosis-positive rate and Fas/Fas ligand expression in the cultured leiomyoma cells were only attained after the 4-day treatment . RT-PCR analysis revealed that GnRH receptor mRNA was expressed in cultured leiomyoma cells . CONCLUSIONS The present results demonstrate that GnRHa directly inhibits the growth of human uterine leiomyoma cells by suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis , which might be associated with the increase in Fas expression and the induction of Fas ligand expression in the cells .
AIMS Tumour cell growth results from a disturbance in the balance between the rate of proliferation and cell death . In this study , proteins involved in the regulation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were studied as possible factors responsible for uncontrolled cell growth in colorectal cancer . METHODS The expression of proteins involved in these processes was investigated in 48 metastases from patients with colorectal cancer and compared with eight normal colon mucosa samples and 14 primary tumours . Both primary tumours and metastases were obtained from eight patients . The expression of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , p53 , retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) , Fas receptor , Fas ligand , bcl-2 , mcl-1 , bax , and bcl-x was measured using immunohistochemistry . Proliferation was determined by Ki67 staining , whereas apoptosis was assessed by M30 immunostaining , which recognises cleaved cytokeratin 18 . RESULTS In the limited number of cases in which paired comparisons were possible , the expression of TS and Ki67 was significantly higher in metastases than in the matched primary tumour samples ( p = 0.014 and 0.016 , respectively ) , whereas Rb expression was lower in metastases than in primary tumours ( p = 0.024 ) . Fas receptor expression was high in normal mucosa but absent in primary tumours and metastases , whereas the opposite was seen for p53 . The expression of bax , mcl-1 , and bcl-x in normal mucosa was more apical than that seen in malignant cells , where a more diffuse expression pattern was seen ( p < 0.04 ) . Apoptosis was more abundant in primary tumours than in metastases . CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that proliferation and apoptosis are disturbed during colorectal cancer progression , and this is accompanied by loss of Rb and Fas expression , the accumulation of p53 and TS , and changes in the expression patterns of bax , mcl-1 , and bcl-xl .
Often the use of cytotoxic drugs in cancer therapy results in stable disease rather than regression of the tumor , and this is typically seen as a failure of treatment . We now show that DNA damage is able to induce senescence in tumor cells expressing wild-type p53 . We also show that cytotoxics are capable of inducing senescence in tumor tissue in vivo . Our results suggest that p53 and p21 play a central role in the onset of senescence , whereas p16(INK4a) function may be involved in maintaining senescence . Thus , like apoptosis , senescence appears to be a p53-induced cellular response to DNA damage and an important factor in determining treatment outcome .
Proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) is a nuclear receptor , which mainly associates with adipogenesis , but also appears to facilitate cell differentiation or apoptosis in certain malignant cells . This apoptosis induction by PPARgamma is increased by co-stimulation with tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) , a member of the TNF family . In this study , we investigated the effect of PPARgamma on Fas-mediated apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cell lines . PPARgamma was expressed on all seven HCC cell lines and located in their nuclei. 15-Deoxy-Delta-12,14-prostaglandin J2 ( 15d- PGJ2 ) , a PPARgamma ligand , inhibited cellular proliferation in HepG2 , SK-Hep1 or HLE cells , unlike pioglitazone , another PPARgamma ligand , which did not have a significant influence on proliferation of these cells . However , 15d-PGJ2 facilitated Fas-mediated HCC apoptosis that could not be induced by Fas alone . These results suggest that PPARgamma can augment TNF-family-induced apoptosis .
We have used a combination of vitamin A ( all-trans-retinyl palmitate ) , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) and radiation to treat human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . This chemoradiotherapy is called " FAR therapy. " In this study we examined the effects of all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , the active metabolite of vitamin A , and ATRA plus 5-FU on two HNSCC cell lines ( YCU-N861 and YCU-H891 ) to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of FAR therapy . ATRA at 1 mM ( the order of concentration found in HNSCC tumors treated with FAR therapy ) inhibited cell proliferation and caused G1 cell cycle arrest in both cell lines . This was associated with a decrease in cyclin D1 , an increase in p27(Kip1) and a reduction in the hyperphosphorylated form of retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) . With YCU-N861 cells , ATRA also caused a decrease in Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) and an increase in Bax . Both ATRA and 5-FU activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) 1 and the combination of both agents resulted in additive or synergistic activation of JNK1 , and also enhanced the induction of apoptosis . The YCU-H891 cells , in which the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( Stat3 ) pathway is constitutively activated , were more resistant to treatments with ATRA , 5-FU and the combination of both agents than YCU-N861 cells . A dominant negative Stat3 construct strongly enhanced the cellular sensitivity of this cell line to 5-FU but not to ATRA . In addition there is evidence that activation of Stat3 is associated with cellular resistance to radiation in HNSCC . Therefore , the addition to FAR therapy of agents that inhibit activation of the Stat3 pathway may enhance the clinical response of patients with HNSCC to FAR therapy .
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that functions to maintain telomeres , the terminal DNA that protects chromosomal integrity , regulating cellular replicative life span . Telomerase is not expressed in most normal human somatic cells but is active in stabilizing telomeres of certain self-renewing cell populations and most malignant cells , making the enzyme an appealing target for anticancer therapy . We describe here a novel cross-species approach to telomerase inhibition . Ectopic expression of the human telomerase catalytic reverse transcriptase component in murine cells inhibited endogenous murine telomerase activity . Using this approach , telomerase inhibition in immortal murine fibroblasts resulted in critical telomere shortening , leading to slowed proliferation , abnormal morphology , altered cell cycle , and telomere dysfunction with cytogenetic instability , followed by apoptotic cell death . Subpopulations of two telomerase-inhibited clones escaped widespread apoptosis , showing proliferative recovery in culture despite persistently inhibited telomerase activity with progressive telomere shortening and dysfunction . This study , by targeting immortal murine cells for telomerase inhibition , demonstrates the importance of telomerase to murine cell immortalization and telomere maintenance . Moreover , the murine model used here should prove useful in further evaluating telomerase inhibition as an anticancer therapy .
A rare immunohistochemical study using 28 surgical sections of human chondrosarcoma revealed that 67.9% of tumour cells had weak ( 10-40% ) or strong ( >40% ) positive immunoreaction for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma . The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma mRNA and protein in human chondrosarcoma cell line OUMS-27 was also determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry , respectively . Furthermore , the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ligands on cell proliferation and survival were investigated in OUMS-27 cells . Pioglitazone , a selective ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma , and 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) ( 15d-PGJ(2) ) , a putative endogenous ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma , inhibited the proliferation of OUMS-27 cells in a dose-dependent manner . The mechanism of cytotoxic effects of 15d-PGJ(2) was via apoptosis as shown by DNA fragmentation using TUNEL stain and DNA ladder formation , and by ultrastructural analysis using transmission electron microscopy . Flow-cytometric analysis using annexin-V-fluorescein and propidium iodide detected the early change of apoptosis , as well as necrosis of OUMS-27 cells at 4 h after co-incubation with 15d-PGJ(2) . These results suggest that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of chondrosarcoma , and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ligands , especially 15d-PGJ(2) , may be of therapeutic value in the treatment of human chondrosarcoma .
UVB from solar radiation is both an initiating and promoting agent for skin cancer . We have found that primary human keratinocytes undergo an apoptotic response to UVB . To determine whether these responses are altered during the course of immortalization , we examined markers of apoptosis in primary human foreskin keratinocytes ( HFK ) transduced with either a retroviral vector expressing the E6 and E7 genes of HPV-16 or with empty vector alone ( LXSN-HFK ) . Whereas LXSN-HFK as well as early passage keratinocytes expressing HPV-16 E6 and E7 ( p7 E6/7-HFK ) were both moderately responsive to UVB irradiation , late passage-immortalized keratinocytes ( p27 E6/7-HFK ) were exquisitely sensitive to UVB-induced apoptosis . After exposure to UVB , enhanced annexin V-positivity and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation were observed in p27 E6/7-HFK compared with either LXSN- or p7 E6/7-HFK . Caspase-3 fluorometric activity assays as well as immunoblot analysis with antibodies to caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase revealed elevated caspase-3 activity and processing at lower UVB doses in p27 E6/7-HFK compared with LXSN- or p7 E6/7-HFK . In addition , the caspase inhibitor DEVD-CHO reduced the apoptotic response and increased survival of all three HFK types . Immunoblot analysis revealed that caspase-8 was activated in all three cell types , but caspase-9 was only activated in p27 E6/7-HFK . Cell cycle analysis further showed that only p27 E6/7-HFK exhibit G(2)/M accumulation that is enhanced by UVB treatment . This accumulation was associated with a rapid down-regulation of Bcl-2 in these cells . The immortalization process subsequent to the expression of HPV E6 and E7 may therefore determine UVB sensitivity by switching the mode of apoptosis from a caspase-8 to a Bcl-2-caspase-9-mediated pathway of apoptosis .
Interactions of CD70 , a tumor necrosis factor-related cell surface ligand and its receptor , CD27 , are thought to play an important role for T- , B- , and natural killer-cell activation . However , ligation of CD27 can also induce apoptosis . Human glioblastoma is paradigmatic for cancer-associated immunosuppression . We identified CD70 as a radioinducible gene in U87 MG glioma cells . A screening of a panel of human glioma cell lines revealed that 11 of 12 cell lines expressed CD70 mRNA and protein . Two human neuroblastoma cell lines did not express CD70 . CD70 mRNA expression was enhanced by irradiation in 8 of 12 glioma cell lines in a p53-independent manner . No alteration in CD70 expression was observed after glioma cell exposure to cytotoxic drugs such as lomustine . CD70 protein was also detected by immunocytochemistry in 5 of 12 glioblastomas and 3 of 4 anaplastic astrocytomas in vivo . CD27 expression was not detected in any glioma cell line , and there was no evidence for autocrine or backward signaling of the CD70 system in human glioma cells . Unexpectedly , CD70 expressed on glioma cells did not increase the immunogenicity of glioma cells in vitro . In contrast , CD70-positive glioma cells induced apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) in a CD70-dependent manner . Neutralization of CD70 expressed on glioma cells prevented apoptosis and enhanced the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in cocultures of glioma cells and PBMCs . The effects of CD70-expressing glioma cells on PBMCs were mimicked by agonistic CD27 antibodies . Conversely , the shedding of CD27 by PBMCs was identified as a possible escape mechanism from glioma cell-induced CD70-dependent apoptosis . Thus , induction of B-cell and T-cell apoptosis via interactions of CD70 expressed on glioma cells and CD27 expressed on B and T cells may be a novel way for the immune escape of malignant gliomas .
BACKGROUND Insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) stimulates cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in the lung and other tissues by interacting with the IGF-I receptor . The major binding protein for IGF-I , insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 ( IGFBP-3 ) , modulates the effects of IGF-I but also inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis independent of IGF-I and its receptor . In a prospective study of men in Shanghai , China , we examined the association between serum levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and the subsequent risk of lung cancer . METHODS From 1986 to 1989 , serum was collected from 18,244 men aged 45-64 years living in Shanghai without a history of cancer . We analyzed IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels in serum from 230 case patients who developed incident lung cancer during follow-up and from 740 control subjects . RESULTS Among 230 case patients and 659 matched control subjects , increased IGF-I levels were not associated with increased risk of lung cancer . However , for subjects in the highest quartile relative to the lowest quartile of IGFBP-3 , the odds ratio ( OR ) for lung cancer , adjusted for smoking and IGF-I , was 0.50 ( 95% confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.25 to 1.02 ) . When the analysis was restricted to ever smokers ( 184 case patients and 344 matched control subjects ) , the OR for lung cancer in men in the highest quartile of IGFBP-3 relative to those in the lowest quartile , adjusted for smoking and IGF-I , was 0.41 ( 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.92 ) . CONCLUSIONS In this prospective study of Chinese men , higher serum levels of IGF-I did not increase the risk of lung cancer . However , subjects with higher serum levels of IGFBP-3 were at reduced risk of lung cancer . This finding is consistent with experimental data that indicate that IGFBP-3 can inhibit cellular proliferation and induce apoptosis independent of IGF-I and the IGF-I receptor .
Direct experimental evidence implicates telomere erosion as a primary cause of cellular senescence . Using a well characterized model system for breast cancer , we define here the molecular and cellular consequences of adriamycin treatment in breast tumor cells . Cells acutely exposed to adriamycin exhibited an increase in p53 activity , a decline in telomerase activity , and a dramatic increase in beta-galactosidase , a marker of senescence . Inactivation of wild-type p53 resulted in a transition of the cellular response to adriamycin treatment from replicative senescence to delayed apoptosis , demonstrating that p53 plays an integral role in the fate of breast tumor cells treated with DNA-damaging agents . Stable introduction of hTERT , the catalytic protein component of telomerase , into MCF-7 cells caused an increase in telomerase activity and telomere length . Treatment of MCF-7-hTERT cells with adriamycin produced an identical senescence response as controls without signs of telomere shortening , indicating that the senescence after treatment is telomere length-independent . However , we found that exposure to adriamycin resulted in an overrepresentation of cytogenetic changes involving telomeres , showing an altered telomere state induced by adriamycin is probably a causal factor leading to the senescence phenotype . To our knowledge , these data are the first to demonstrate that the mechanism of adriamycin-induced senescence is dependent on both functional p53 and telomere dysfunction rather than overall shortening .
The beneficial effect of yoghurt consumption on health and on the improvement of the mucosal immune system is well established , as is the diet-associated risk of colon cancer . In an experimental model in BALB/c mice we demonstrated that yoghurt added to the diet for 10 consecutive days , with the procedure repeated each 10 days for 6 months , inhibited the development of a colorectal carcinoma induced by 1,2 dimethylhydrazine ( DMH ) . The immunoregulatory mechanisms involved in the inhibition of tumour growth by yoghurt were also examined in these studies . We determined B lymphocytes IgA(+) and IgG(+) , as well as CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the large intestine . We measured cellular apoptosis and the cytokines TNF-alpha , IFN-gamma and IL-10 . An increase in the number of IgA(+) ( P<0.01 ) was observed , but not in IgG(+) ( P<0.01 ) , or in the CD4(+) population ( P<0.01 ) in the mice treated with DMH and yoghurt . While in the group with the carcinogen there was an enhancement in the IgG(+) B cells ( P<0.01 ) and CD8(+) T cells ( P<0.01 ) . Yoghurt increased the number of apoptotic cells and induced IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha cytokine release , their production being regulated by an increase in IL-10 ( P<0.001 ) . We demonstrated that yoghurt may exert antitumour activity by a decrease in the inflammatory immune response mediated by IgA(+) increase , apoptosis induction and IL-10 release .
We investigated the direct effects of LH-releasing hormone ( LH-RH ) antagonist , Cetrorelix , on the growth of HTOA human epithelial ovarian cancer cell line . RT-PCR revealed the expression of mRNA for LH-RH and its receptor in HTOA cells . Cetrorelix , at concentrations between 10(-9) and 10(-5) M , exerted a dose-dependent antiproliferative action on HTOA cells , as measured by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA . Flow cytometric analysis indicated that Cetrorelix , at 10(-5) M , arrested cell cycle in HTOA cells , at G1 phase , after 24 h of treatment . Western blot analysis of cell cycle-regulatory proteins demonstrated that treatment with Cetrorelix ( 10(-5) M ) for 24 h did not change the steady-state levels of cyclin D1 , cyclin E , and cyclin-dependent kinase ( Cdk)4 but decreased the levels of cyclin A and Cdk2 . The protein levels of p21 ( a Cdk inhibitor ) and p53 ( a suppressor of tumor cell growth and a positive regulator for p21 expression ) were increased by Cetrorelix , but the levels of p27 ( a Cdk inhibitor ) did not change significantly . Flow cytometric analysis and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5-triphosphate nick end labeling staining demonstrated that Cetrorelix ( 10(-5) M ) induced apoptosis in HTOA cells . In conclusion , Cetrorelix directly inhibits the proliferation of human epithelial ovarian cancer cells through mechanisms mediated by LH-RH receptor and involving multiple events in cell cycle progression , including G1 phase cell cycle arrest coupled with down-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 complex levels , presumably attributable to an up-regulation of p53 and p21 protein levels and apoptosis .
The aim of this study was to extend our previous observations on the soy modulation of biochemical parameters in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene ( DMBA)-induced rat mammary tumors , by simultaneously investigating the expression of estrogen receptor-alpha ( ERalpha ) , estrogen receptor-beta ( ERbeta ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , apoptosis , neu , and markers of cell proliferation , such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) by immunohistochemistry . The percentage of ERalpha positive tumors was 65.8% in masses from control animals , and significantly dropped to 36.8% in tumors from soy treated rats ( P=0.010 ) . The percentage of ERbeta positive tumors was 70.3% in masses from control animals vs. 50.0% in tumors from soy exposed animals ( P=0.066 ) . Moreover , the percentage of cases which were both ERalpha and ERbeta positive was significantly lower ( 17.6% ) in soy treated than in control animals ( 51.3% ) ( P=0.006 ) . The percentage of PR positive tumors was 34.2% in control animals vs. 2.6% in tumors from soy treated rats ( P=0.0006 ) . There were no statistically significant differences in the percentage of tumors positively stained for neu , apoptosis , or PCNA , in control vs. soy treated rats . However , when analyzing the reciprocal correlation among the different biochemical parameters we showed that , in treated animals , the majority of ERalpha positive tumors ( 91.7% ) were also PCNA positive ( P=0.036 ) . The median percentage of PCNA positivity was significantly higher in ERalpha positive than in ERalpha negative tumors ( 25 vs. 5% ) ( P=0.0031 ) . Moreover , an association was found between PCNA and neu status since all neu positive tumors were also PCNA positive ( P=0.011 ) .
When cells were incubated in the presence of both interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) and all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , the concentration of IFN-gamma required to induce apoptosis of B-cell lymphoma cells was much lower than that required for myeloid or erythroid cell lines . The concentration of IFN-gamma that effectively inhibited the proliferation of BALM-3 cells was 1/40 of that required for BALM-1 cells . STAT-1 phosphorylation , IRF-1 mRNA and protein expression and RAR-beta expression were enhanced to a greater degree in BALM-3 cells treated with IFN-gamma and ATRA than in BALM-1 cells treated with IFN-gamma and ATRA , suggesting that these IFN-gamma related genes were involved in the induction of apoptosis of BALM-3 cells .
The knowledge of alterations in regulation of autophagy during tumorigenesis may also help our understanding of its normal control . We established an experimental system and reported recently that autophagic capacity , measured as the cell's capability of increasing segregation ( formation of autophagosomes ) and subsequent degradation of cytoplasmic quanta were highly increased in premalignant nodule cells 6 months after initiation by azaserine in the rat pancreas in vivo . In the present study , we followed changes of these autophagic functions throughout the tumour progression . We carried out electron-microscopic morphometrical analysis of the expansion of autophagic vacuole compartment and subcompartments induced by vinblastine ( an in vivo segregation enhancer ) , as well as their regression upon segregation-inhibitor cycloheximide post-treatment . Premalignant tumour samples were taken at month 5 , month 8 ( nodules ) , month 10 and month 15 ( adenomas ) after initiation . In all these stages , a highly increased and varying autophagic capacity was found compared with the host tissue . The basal ( non-stimulated ) autophagic compartment was measurable only at month 5 and month 15 , and its regression upon cycloheximide was consistent with increased basal autophagic activity . Compared with the host tissue , autophagic capacity profoundly decreased in the differentiated and anaplastic adenocarcinomas at month 20 , when , surprisingly , cycloheximide was unable to inhibit segregation . Our conclusion is that down-regulation of the cycloheximide sensitive segregation and a partly compensatory up-regulation of an alternative pathway of segregation might occur along with malignant transformation .
We investigated the mode of cell death induced by the anthracyclines , aclarubicin , doxorubicin and daunorubicin in the human leukemia cell lines , HL60 and Jurkat . The cells were incubated with drug concentrations up to 500 nM for periods between 3 and 24 hours , followed by morphological and biochemical analyses . All three substances induced DNA fragmentation , evident as DNA laddering and appearance of cells with hypodiploid DNA content , externalization of phosphatidyl serine , activation of caspases and degradation of the apoptosis-specific endonuclease inhibitor DFF45 . However , concentrations and times necessary for these effects to occur were different , aclarubicin being the quickest acting drug with a lag phase of 3 h , followed by daunorubicin with 6 h and doxorubicin with 24 h . More importantly , aclarubicin induced these effects while the cell membrane was intact , whereas doxorubicin and daunorubicin led to immediate loss of membrane integrity . Programmed cell death is characterised by preservation of membrane integrity in order to allow removal of apoptotic bodies , whereas cell rupture is an early event in necrosis . We therefore suggest that , in our experimental settings , doxorubicin- and daunorubicin-induced cell death occurs by necrosis , while aclarubicin induces programmed cell death .
In human colorectal adenomas or polyps , cyclooxygenase-2 is expressed predominantly by stromal ( or interstitial ) macrophages . Therefore , we tested the hypothesis that macrophage cyclooxygenase-2 has paracrine pro-tumorigenic activity using in vitro models of macrophage-epithelial cell interactions . We report that macrophages can promote tumorigenic progression of intestinal epithelial cells ( evidenced by decreased cell-cell contact inhibition , increased proliferation and apoptosis , gain of anchorage-independent growth capability , decreased membranous E-cadherin expression , up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression , down-regulation of transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor expression and resistance to the anti-proliferative activity of transforming growth factor-beta(1) ) in a paracrine , cyclooxygenase-2-dependent manner . Pharmacologically relevant concentrations ( 1-2 microM ) of a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor had no detectable , direct effect on intestinal epithelial cells but inhibited the macrophage-epithelial cell signal mediating tumorigenic progression . Cyclooxygenase-2-mediated stromal-epithelial cell signalling during the early stages of intestinal tumorigenesis provides a novel target for chemoprevention of colorectal cancer ( and other gastro-intestinal epithelial malignancies , which arise on a background of chronic inflammation , such as gastric cancer ) and may explain the discrepancy between the concentrations of cyclooxygenase inhibitors required to produce anti-neoplastic effects in vitro and in vivo .
Nur77 is an orphan receptor . Although Nur77 affects cell proliferation and apoptosis through its capability of binding to a variety of response elements and regulating their transactivation activities , the intrinsic function of Nur77 is not yet fully understood ; in particular , its regulation of apoptosis and proliferation has been characterized as cell type-dependent and agent context-dependent . In this study , Nur77 can be seen to regulate apoptosis via its expression and translocation , rather than its transactivation activity in gastric cancer cells . Nur77 was constitutively expressed in BGC-823 cells . The tetradecanoylphorbol-1,3-acetate ( TPA ) treatment not only resulted in up-regulation of the Nur77 mRNA level , but also led to translocation of Nur77 protein from the nucleus to the mitochondria , and caused the release of cytochrome c . This TPA-induced translocation of Nur77 was in association with the initiation of apoptosis in gastric cancer cells . Although all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) could not induce apoptosis in BGC-823 cells due to failure of stimulating Nur77 translocation , expression of Nur77 in the nucleus was required for cell growth inhibition by ATRA . Transfection of antisense Nur77 receptor into BGC-823 cells resulted in resistance of cell growth against ATRA inhibition , and the cells were still arrested in the S phase . Furthermore , the action of Nur77 in TPA-induced apoptosis was mediated through a protein kinase C signaling pathway , while mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways were responsible for the regulation of Nur77 mRNA expression . Taken together , the data revealed the dual functioning mechanisms of Nur77 in gastric cancer cells in response to TPA and ATRA .
PURPOSE Osteosarcoma is an aggressive primary bone cancer characterized by expression of platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) and its cognate receptor . Coexpression of the growth factor and receptor suggests their role in autocrine or paracrine growth mechanisms . It has been reported previously that STI571 has specific activity in inhibiting select tyrosine kinase receptors , including PDGF and c-Kit . Osteosarcomas express low levels of c-Kit but abundant levels of PDGF receptor ( PDGFR ) . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN To investigate the potential of STI571 as therapy for osteosarcoma , we studied its effects on PDGF-mediated cell growth in vitro and in an in vivo mouse model . RESULTS PDGF acted as a potent mitogen in a dose-dependent manner in two osteosarcoma cell lines . STI571 ( 1.0 micro M ) inhibited both PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta phosphorylation and the downstream phosphorylation targets extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt . STI571 also inhibited PDGF-mediated growth and induced apoptosis in vitro as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling staining . To study the effect of STI571 alone or in combination with Taxol in an in vivo model , an osteosarcoma cell line ( KRIB ) was transplanted into the tibia of athymic nude mice . Mice were treated with STI571 ( 50 mg/kg p.o. q M-F ) , Taxol ( 8 mg/kg i.p. weekly ) , or STI571 plus Taxol for 6 weeks . There was no significant difference in tumor size between treatment and control mice . Aberrant signaling pathways downstream of the PDGFR in the v-Ki-ras oncogene-transformed KRIB cell line may in part explain this finding . CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrate that STI571 inhibits PDGF-mediated growth and leads to apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells in vitro by selective inhibition of the PDGFR tyrosine kinase . The effectiveness of STI571 in our studies suggests targeting of PDGFRs as a novel treatment for osteosarcoma .
Onconase ( Onc ) is an amphibian ribonuclease of the pancreatic RNase family that is cytostatic and cytotoxic to several tumor lines . It also shows anti-tumor activity in mouse tumor models and is currently in phase III clinical trials . In animal tests and clinical trials Onc shows lesser toxicity and fewer side effects compared to most chemotherapeutic drugs . Intriguingly , repeated infusions of this protein do not cause apparent immunological reactions in patients . The aim of the present study was to investigate sensitivity to Onc of human lymphocytes during their mitogenic stimulation in response to the polyvalent mitogen phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) , and in mixed allogeneic lymphocyte cultures . Unexpectedly , we observed that frequency of cells undergoing activation-induced apoptosis was markedly increased in all cultures containing Onc . Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using markers that detect activation of caspases , the in situ presence of DNA strand breaks , and loss of fragmented DNA ( 'sub-G1 ' cell subpopulation ) . The enhancement of frequency of activation-induced apoptosis ( up to 244% ) was observed at 4.2-83 nM Onc concentration , which is at least an order magnitude lower than its minimal concentration reported to affect proliferation or induce apoptosis of leukemic and solid tumor cell lines . The cell cycle progression of lymphocytes that responded to PHA mitogenically was not affected at 8.3 or 83 nM Onc concentration . Because activation-induced apoptosis is the key mechanism regulating several in vivo immunological functions including induction of tolerance , the observed effects of Onc may explain the apparent lack of immune reactions to this protein in treated patients . The propensity of Onc to potentiate the activation-induced apoptosis suggests that this drug may have clinical utility as immunomodulating agent , e.g. , to suppress transplant rejection or treat autoimmune diseases .
We studied whether feeding pregnant female rats different high fat diets affects structural zones in the spleen and lymph nodes , involved in production of T and B cells , as well as cell kinetics and apoptosis in some offspring with mammary glands tumors . Rat mothers were fed either a 7% or 15% corn-oil or a 7% or 15% olive-oil diet . At four weeks of age , female offspring ( n=10-15 per group ) were transferred to 7% corn oil diet . Five-week old offspring were exposed twice to the carcinogen , dimethylbenz(a)antracene ( 10 mg/rat/week ) . Three months later , tumors were counted and sized , and samples from the spleen , axillary lymph nodes and tumors collected for immunohistochemical analyses . Feeding the mothers with both the 7% and 15% olive-oil diets significantly increased the number of tumor-free rats in offspring . Tumors were characterized with active mitosis , intensive lymphoid infiltration inside a knot and high rates of apoptosis , particularly in tumors obtained from rats whose mothers were fed the 15% olive-oil diet . In the spleen , the 15% olive-oil diet significantly increased the areas of the follicles and germinal centers but only in tumor-free rats . In tumor-bearing rats , areas of germinal centers increased compared to the 7% olive-oil diet . The 15% olive-oil diet increased all areas of the lymph nodes in tumor-free rats , while in tumor-bearing rats , this diet increased the areas of the cortex and mantle layer . We conclude that exposure to various diets in utero and during lactation affects the immune system . In addition , the promotion of apoptosis may play a key role in the mechanisms involved in the transplacental effects on mammary tumor development as seen using a 15% olive-oil diet , similar to the high fat diets of Mediterranean countries .
Triggering tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 ( TNFR1 ) induces apoptosis in various cell lines . In contrast , stimulation of TNFR1 in L929sA leads to necrosis . Inhibition of HSP90 , a chaperone for many kinases , by geldanamycin or radicicol shifted the response of L929sA cells to TNF from necrosis to apoptosis . This shift was blocked by CrmA but not by BCL-2 overexpression , suggesting that it occurred through activation of procaspase-8 . Geldanamycin pretreatment led to a proteasome-dependent decrease in the levels of several TNFR1-interacting proteins including the kinases receptor-interacting protein , inhibitor of kappa B kinase-alpha , inhibitor of kappa B kinase-beta , and to a lesser extent the adaptors NF-kappaB essential modulator and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 . As a consequence , NF-kappa B , p38MAPK , and JNK activation were abolished . No significant decrease in the levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases , adaptor proteins TNFR-associated death domain and Fas-associated death domain , or caspase-3 , -8 , and -9 could be detected . These results suggest that HSP90 client proteins play a crucial role in necrotic signaling . We conclude that inhibition of HSP90 may alter the composition of the TNFR1 complex , favoring the caspase-8-dependent apoptotic pathway . In the absence of geldanamycin , certain HSP90 client proteins may be preferentially recruited to the TNFR1 complex , promoting necrosis . Thus , the availability of proteins such as receptor-interacting protein , Fas-associated death domain , and caspase-8 can determine whether TNFR1 activation will lead to apoptosis or to necrosis .
AIM The study was designed to explore the effects of antisense human telomerase RNA ( ahTR ) on the malignant phenotype of gastric carcinoma cell line SGC-7901 , and its potential role in gene therapy for tumors . METHODS An ahTR eukaryotic expression vector , including the sequence of template region of telomere repeats , was constructed by recombinant technology of molecules and then transfected into gastric carcinoma cell line SGC-7901 by liposome DOTAP . Subsequently , the expression of hTR RNA and ahTR RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction , telomerase activity by telomeric repeat amplification protocol-ELISA ( TRAP-ELISA ) , telomere length by Southern blotting , cell morphology under light microscope , cellular proliferation capacity by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2 thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay , cell-cycle distribution by flow cytometry , efficiency of clone formation in soft agar , and tumorigenecity in nude mice were examined and evaluated in ahTR-transfected cells , control plasmid pCI-neo transfected cells and their parental cells . RESULTS An ahTR eukaryotic expression vector was constructed and successfully transfected into SGC-7901 cells . The telomerase activity in ahTR-transfected SGC-7901 cells decreased from 100% to approximately 25% , and telomere length in the cells shortened to 3.35 from 4.08 Kb at 60 population doublings . Compared with the parental cells and pCI-neo transfected cells , ahTR-transfected cells displayed some morphological changes , such as decreased atypia , and recovery of contact inhibition and density inhibition under light microscope . Furthermore , ahTR-transfected cells displayed decreased invasive capacity in Borden's chamber invasive model , increased G0/G1 phase rate and apoptotic rate . Surprisingly , ahTR-transfected SGC-7901 cells lost their capacity for clone formation in soft agar and tumorigencity in nude mice . CONCLUSION Antisense-hTR transfection can inhibit the growth of SGC-7901 cells and partially reverse the malignant phenotypes . This study provides an exciting approach for cancer therapy by inhibiting telomerase activity using an antisense gene .
Estrogen affects apoptotic cell death in estrogen-responsive tissues . The purpose of the present study was to examine dynamic changes in apoptotic cell death in the anterior pituitary gland during the estrous cycle and to investigate neuroendocrine regulation of these changes in cycling female rats . Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling ( TUNEL ) for in situ detection of DNA strand breaks revealed that the number of TUNEL-positive anterior pituitary cells was changing during the estrous cycle , with a maximum in the morning of proestrus and a minimum in the morning of estrus . A similar pattern was observed with Bax immunostaining ; however , no difference was observed in Bcl-2 immunostaining . Most of Bax-immunoreactive cells were identified as a subpopulation of gonadotropes . Pentobarbital administered in the afternoon of proestrus attenuated the decrease in TUNEL-positive or Bax-immunoreactive cells in the morning of estrus , although estradiol treatment failed to affect it . This action of pentobarbital was reduced by simultaneous treatment with an ovulation-inducing dose of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) , but not with progesterone , an ovarian steroid also released after GnRH treatment . These results suggest that anterior pituitary cells , mostly gonadotropes , undergo a cyclic change in apoptotic cell death during the estrous cycle and that the inhibition of apoptosis on estrus is due , at least in part , to the proestrous surge of GnRH secretion .
The capacity to repair DNA damage is an important factor that affects the therapeutic outcome in cancer treatment . To clarify the cellular repair response , we investigated the kinetics of DNA excision repair initiated by 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea ( BCNU ) in human leukemia CCRF-CEM cells at an exponential growth phase in vitro . Using the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis ( comet ) assay , we quantitated the repair kinetics as the amount of DNA single-strand breaks that were generated from the incision and were diminished by the rejoining in the repair process . CEM cells could initiate DNA excision repair in response to BCNU by starting an incision reaction . However , the incision capacity came to a plateau at a concentration of 80 to 100 microM or after an incubation time of 90 to 120 minutes . When the cells were pulsed with 40 microM BCNU , the maximal incision occurred at the end of the incubation period , and the repair process was completed within 4 hours When cells were treated with 100 microM BCNU , the incised DNA was not rejoined at 4 hours , suggesting that the repair was not completed . Higher concentrations might surpass the cellular capacity for repair and would be associated with increased cell death . Evaluation of the repair process may provide a clue for therapeutic strategies to improve clinical efficacy if accelerated DNA repair is responsible for the drug resistance .
Our previous studies have shown that genistein inhibits the growth of PC3 prostate cancer cells and induces apoptosis by inhibiting nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and Akt signaling pathways . To better understand the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which genistein exerts its effects on PC3 cells , we utilized cDNA microarray to interrogate 12,558 known genes to determine the gene expression profiles altered by genistein treatment . We found a total of 832 genes that showed a greater than twofold change after genistein treatment from two independent experiments with a high degree of concordance . Among these genes , 774 genes were down-regulated and 58 genes were up-regulated with genistein treatment . Cluster analysis showed nine different types of expression alternations . These genes were also subjected to cluster analysis according to their biological functions . We found that genistein regulated the expression of genes that are critically involved in the regulation of cell growth , cell cycle , apoptosis , cell signaling transduction , angiogenesis , tumor cell invasion and metastasis . Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analysis was used to confirm the results of cDNA microarray , and the results of RT-PCR were consistent with the microarray data . We conclude that genistein affected the expression of a large number of genes that are related to the control of cell survival and physiologic behaviors . The gene expression profiles provide comprehensive molecular mechanism(s) by which genistein exerts its pleiotropic effects on cancer cells . Genistein-induced regulation of these genes may be further exploited for devising chemopreventive and/or therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer .
Properly regulated keratinocyte cell death is fundamentally important to maintain structural integrity and homeostatic function of epidermis . Moreover , from an oncological perspective , therapeutic approaches selectively targeting apoptosis of malignant cell types while sparing normal keratinocytes in surrounding skin is desirable . Apo2Ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( Apo2L/TRAIL ) has been observed to preferentially induce cytopathic effects on transformed/malignant cell types compared with their non-neoplastic counterparts . In this report , two different biologically active preparations of Apo2L/TRAIL , a non-tagged version , NT-Apo2L/TRAIL , and a leucine zipper fusion protein , LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL , were examined for their ability to trigger apoptosis in normal human keratinocytes , and in an immortalized cell line ( HaCaT cells ) . Differences between these preparations were observed , including : NT-Apo2L/TRAIL induced less keratinocyte apoptosis compared with LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL ; NT-Apo2L/TRAIL also induced less apoptosis of HaCaT cells compared with LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL ; LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL but not NT-Apo2L/TRAIL induced cytotoxic effects when keratinocytes became growth arrested due to undergoing spontaneous replicative senescence--a biological state previously observed to be resistant to UV-light-induced apoptosis . Similarities between preparations included : an enhanced ability for both Apo2L/TRAIL preparations to kill a greater relative percentage of HaCaT cells compared with keratinocytes ; enhanced cytotoxicity towards keratinocytes that had their NF-B activity inhibited ; a dependence of both Apo2L/TRAIL preparations on FADD and caspase activation ; triggering of the same caspase cascades including caspase 8 and 3 ; and an ability to induce apoptosis even when HaCaT cells and keratinocytes were transduced to overexpress either Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) ( survival factors that reduce susceptibility to UV-light-induced apoptosis ) . These results indicate that while both preparations of Apo2L/TRAIL possess biological activity , there are important differences as regards their ability to induce apoptosis in normal and immortalized keratinocytes . Moreover , the death receptor pathway triggered by LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL can overcome the apoptotic resistance normally observed in response to UV-light mediated by Bcl-2/Bcl-x(L) , as well as by the state of cellular senescence . Unraveling the molecular basis for these differential biological effects may reveal a new strategic role for these death receptor/ligands linked to apoptosis in maintaining the dynamic balance of keratinocyte proliferation , differentiation , and cell death necessary to achieve a homeostatic thickness and function of normal skin . In addition , it may be possible to utilize these Apo2L/TRAIL preparations for the treatment of various sun-induced skin cancers as they can differentially trigger apoptosis of transformed keratinocytes , or keratinocytes with abnormal NF-kappaB signaling , while sparing adjacent normal keratinocytes .
Several members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family play key roles in recognising and responding to damage in DNA , induced by a variety of chemicals and other agents . One of these , ATM , the product of the gene mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) , recognises double strand breaks in DNA caused by ionizing radiation and radiomimetic chemicals . In order to study DNA damage recognition and the abnormalities of genome instability and cancer predisposition that occur in A-T patients , we generated a mouse model expressing a mutant form of Atm corresponding to a common human mutation . In this model , a 9 nucleotide in-frame deletion was introduced into the Atm gene and has been designated Atm-Delta SRI . These animals had a longer lifespan than Atm gene disrupted mice ( Atm(-/-) ) and they developed less thymic lymphomas . A characteristic of the lymphomas appearing in Atm-Delta SRI mice was an increased rate of apoptosis compared to the corresponding tumours in Atm(-/-) mice . Increased expression of FasL in these tumours may account for the higher levels of apoptosis . These results demonstrate that expression of mutant Atm in mice gives rise to phenotypic differences compared to Atm(-/-) mice and has implications for heterogeneity described in the human syndrome .
It was proved that nuclear factor-kappa B play an important role in the activation of immune cell , anti-virus , various stress reaction , and regulation of apoptosis , etc . The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of NF-kappa B signal-transduction pathway on apoptosis of hepatic carcinoma cell line-7721 induced by TNF-alpha .
Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) may trigger apoptosis or necrosis in cancer cells . Several steps in the induction and execution of apoptosis require high amounts of adenosine-5'-triphosphate ( ATP ) . Because the mitochondrial membrane potential ( delta psi ) decreases early in apoptosis , we raised the question about the mechanisms of maintaining a sufficiently high ATP level . We therefore monitored delta psi and the intracellular ATP level of apoptotic human epidermoid carcinoma cells ( A431 ) after photodynamic treatment with aluminum ( III ) phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate . A maximum of caspase-3-like activity and nuclear fragmentation was found at fluences of about 4 J cm(-2) . Under these conditions apoptotic cells reduced delta psi rapidly , while the ATP level remained high for 4-6 h after treatment for cells supplied with glucose . To analyze the contribution of glycolysis to the energy supply during apoptosis , experiments were carried out with cells deprived of glucose . These cells showed a rapid drop of ATP content and neither caspase activation nor nuclear fragmentation could be detected . We conclude that the use of glucose as a source of ATP is obligatory for the execution of PDT-induced apoptosis .
To explore the possibility of a new therapeutic strategy for leukemia by intervening in the DNA methylation to re-express p15 suppressor gene , methylation inhibitors , 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5-Aza-CdR ) and cell differentiation agent ( CDAII ) were used to treat myelogenous leukemia cell line KG1a in which p15 gene expression was suppressed due to DNA hypermethylation . The biological characteristics of KG1a cells untreated or treated with the agents were investigated and analyzed using morphology , methylation specific-PCR ( MSP ) , ( 3)H-labeled microassay technique , restriction endonuclease reaction , flow cytometry and immunofluorescence methods . The results indicated that both agents showed concentration-dependent and time-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. 5-Aza-CdR and CDAII induced apoptosis and cell differentiation with G(2) and G(0)/G(1) arrest respectively . Furthermore , DNA methyltransferase activity and level of methylation in genomic DNA were decreased and p15 protein was re-expressed partially . It is concluded that it is possible to treat leukemia by intervening in the DNA methylation using methyltransferase inhibitors and it is worth to make a thorough study on mechanism of the new strategy .
The purpose of this investigation was to study the variation of p73 gene expression in the apoptotic process of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cell line U937 induced by methotrexate ( MTX ) . Morphological changes of apoptotic cells were observed with microscopy and Wright's + Giemsa staining . DNA ladder and cell cycle were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry respectively . Using semi-quantitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , the expression of p73 mRNA was examined . Results showed that MTX could induce U937 cell apoptosis effectively . Condensed nuclei , fragmentation of chromosome and DNA ladder were seen after 6 hour following treatment of MTX 5 micro mol/L . Sub-G(1) peak and S + G(2)/M arrest were also determined by FCM , but the quantity of p73 expression was generally constant . In conclusion , U937 cell apoptosis induced by MTX did not change p73 mRNA level .
IL-16 is a ligand and chemotactic factor for CD4+ T cells . IL-16 inhibits the CD3 mediated lymphocyte activation and proliferation . The effects of IL-16 on the target cells are dependent on the cell type , the presence of co-activators etc . To understand the regulation function and mechanism of IL-16 on target cells , we used a 130 a.a. recombinant IL-16 to study its effects on the growth of Jurkat T leukemia cells in vitro . We found that the rIL-16 stimulated the proliferation of Jurkat cells at low dose ( 10(-9)M ) , but inhibited the growth of the cells at higher concentration ( 10(-5)M ) . Results showed that 10(-5) M of rIL-16 treatment induced an enhanced apoptosis in Jurkat cells . The treatment blocked the expression of FasL , but up-regulated the c-myc and Bid expression in the cells . Pre-treatment of PKC inhibitor or MEK1 inhibitor markedly increased or decreased the rIL-16 induced growth-inhibiting effects on Jurkat cells , respectively . The results suggested that the rIL-16 might be a regulator for the growth or apoptosis of Jurkat cells at a dose-dependent manner . The growth-inhibiting effects of rIL-16 might be Fas/FasL independent , but , associated with the activation of PKC , up-regulated expression of c-Myc and Bid , and the participation of the ERK signal pathway in Jurkat cells .
The vinorelbine sensitivity of eight recently established head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) cell lines was tested using the 96-well plate clonogenic assay . The chemosensitivity of these head and neck SCC cell lines to vinorelbine expressed as IC50 , corresponding to the drug concentration causing 50% inhibition in clonogenic survival , varied between 0.6 and 1.0 nM . The dose-dependent growth inhibition caused by vinorelbine was measured in three of these cell lines . A clear growth inhibition was observed at a concentration of 3 nM . The same cell lines were studied with flow cytometry . When exposed to 3 nM and 5 nM vinorelbine , an accumulation of the cells in the G2/M-phase was observed in all cultures after 12 hours . The morphological changes induced by 3 nM and 5 nM vinorelbine to the UT-SCC-33 cell line were analysed with time-lapse video microscopy . In the cultures treated with 5 nM vinorelbine , the cells stayed mitotically arrested for 2-32 hours and thereafter died morphologically by apoptosis . These results indicate that , in vitro , the head and neck SCC is consistently sensitive to vinorelbine , which blocks the cell cycle in G2/M , the most radiosensitive phase . These encouraging results suggest that vinorelbine may potentially be used in conjunction with radiotherapy in the treatment of head and neck SCC .
Arsenic trioxide ( ATO ) is a novel agent to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . ATO can degrade chimeric PML-RAR proteins and induce apoptosis in various cancer cells . However , its effects on primary hematopoietic CD34+ have not been examined . In this study , we compared the effects of ATO on HL60 leukemic cells and primary umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) CD34+ cells . HL60 cells and UCB CD34+ cells were cultured with different concentrations of ATO for up to three weeks and examined for changes of cell cycle . We found that ATO ( < or = 5 microM ) caused prolongation of G1/S and G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner . The percentage of cells in G2/M increased significantly ( from 8.6 to 53.8% ) . High-dose ATO ( > or = 25 microM ) caused non-specific cell death in HL60 cells without any changes in cell cycle . In contrast to HL60 cells , UCB CD34+ cells were more resistant to high-dose ATO and most ATO-resistant CD34+ cells remained in G0/G1 phase . Primary cells that were resistant to ATO were rich in CD34+ cells . We further show that the ATO resistance was not related to the expression of P-glycoprotein ( MDR-1 ) . Our results suggest that the resistance to ATO in primitive UCB CD34+ cells is most likely related to its cell-cycle status . These results could be useful to design treatments for non-APL malignancies and to enrich hematopoietic stem cells in clinically applicable settings .
Chinese medicinal herbs are traditionally used to prevent and treat a variety of diseases , including cancer . These herbal preparations are purported to have many biological effects including direct antiproliferative effects on cancer cells , anti-mutagenic activity , and stimulatory or suppressive effects on immune responses . The present study investigates the effects of aqueous extracts from seventy-one Chinese medicinal herbs on the growth of five breast cancer cell lines ( SK-BR-3 , MCF7 , MDA-MB-231 , BT-474 and MCNeuA ) . Twenty-one percent ( 15 out of 71 ) of the extracts demonstrated greater than 50% growth inhibition on at least 4 of the 5 cell lines . Dose-response curves were obtained for several of the most potent crude extracts and demonstrated IC50 values ranging from < 10 micrograms/ml to > 1 mg/ml . Six of seven herbs tested induced high molecular weight DNA fragmentation , an early marker of apoptosis , while one of these also induced low molecular weight DNA fragmentation . Flow cytometric analysis of breast cancer cells exposed to one of these herbs ( Rheum palmatum ) suggested that it arrests cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle . These results indicate that many of the herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of cancer have significant growth inhibitory effects on breast cancer cells in vitro .
The effects of glucocorticoid ( GC ) on the proliferation of Dunn Osteosarcoma ( OS ) cells were examined under in vitro culture conditions . Dexamethasone ( Dex ) inhibited the proliferation of Dunn OS cells in a dose-dependent manner , while the addition of anti-GC , RU486 , to the culture medium in part recovered Dex-induced growth inhibition . The number of maximum binding sites ( Bmax ) and the dissociation constant ( Kd ) value of glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) in Dunn OS cells were 19,560 sites/cell and 5.2 +/- 0.8 nM , respectively . RU486 competed with labeled Dex against GR at a concentration of 10(-6) M. Western blot analysis of [ 3H]Dex-mesylate-labeled cell homogenate and immunohistochemical staining against GR further confirmed the presence of GR . Dex treatment of Dunn OS cells resulted in apoptosis with the characteristic internucleosomal DNA cleavage shown by the DNA ladder pattern in agarose gel electrophoresis . These data demonstrate that GC inhibits the proliferation of Dunn OS cells via GR , for which one possible mechanism in vitro is induction of apoptosis .
We studied the effect of oxidative stress induced by hyperoxia , hydrogen peroxide , or menadione on mouse leukemia P388 cells at early ( 4 days ) and late ( 7 days ) stages of tumor growth . Oxidative stress proved to inhibit cell division and to induce apoptosis . Seven-day leukemia cells feature lower proliferative potential and higher sensitivity to oxidative stress and platidiam .
A clinicopathological study of 41 cases of pituitary apoplexy in a series of 324 surgically treated pituitary adenomas is presented . In 23 patients , the predominant operative finding was hemorrhage with or without necrosis . However , there were 15 ( 37.7% ) cases where pale , necrotic tissue with no evidence of hemorrhage was found at surgery . Pale , necrotic material was particularly found when there was a long interval between the acute clinical event and surgery . It is concluded that the pale , necrotic debris represents one stage in the resorption process of blood after hemorrhagic necrosis of pituitary adenomas . This entity needs to be kept in mind especially since the material closely resemble the pultaceous material seen in craniopharyngiomas and epidermoid cysts .
ZBP-89 ( ZNF148 ) is a Zinc finger Binding Protein of 89 kDa that binds GC-rich DNA elements . Originally , it was expression cloned using a DNA element mediating EGF regulation of the gastrin promoter . ZBP-89 functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor . A variety of extracellular regulators including TGFbeta , retinoic acid and butyrate stimulate ZBP-89 gene expression . Butyrate activation of p21WAF1 is potentiated by ZBP-89 through the recruitment of the co-activator p300 , while chronic stimulation by butyrate increases ZBP-89 gene expression correlating with cell differentiation . ZBP-89 stimulates growth arrest and apoptosis through its ability to bind the p21WAF1 promoter or its ability to form protein-protein interactions with p53 . ZBP-89 protein is elevated in a variety of gastrointestinal cancers as well as the pancreas . In particular , ZBP-89 is normally expressed in pancreatic islets and ducts and in about 30% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas .
To investigate the significance of sialylation and sulfation of lactosylceramide in transformed cells , we established ganglioside GM3- and lactosylsulfatide ( SM3)-reconstituted cells by transfecting cDNAs of GM3 synthase and cerebroside sulfotransferase into the J5 subclone of 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma cells . The J5 clone was selected for the transfection of these genes because it lacks GM3 and SM3 but accumulates lactosylceramide . The anchorage-dependent growth of both GM3- and SM3-reconstituted cells was similar . However , anchorage-independent growth ( as measured by colony-forming ability in soft agar ) of the SM3- reconstituted cells was almost completely lost , which supports our previous observation showing the suppression of tumorigenic potential in vivo and beta1 integrin gene expression induced by the introduction of cerebroside sulfotransferase gene ( Kabayama et al. [ 2001 ] J. Biol . Chem. , 276 , 26777-26783 ) . The GM3-reconstituted cells formed a significantly higher number of colonies in soft agar compared to mock-transfected cells and began to proliferate and become resistant to apoptosis when serum was depleted , indicating that endogenous GM3 is essential for maintaining these fundamental properties of malignant cells . We also found that serum-induced ERK1/2 activation was suppressed in the GM3-reconstituted cells , suggesting that anchorage-independent cell cycle initiation by endogenous GM3 is elicited through pathway(s) independent of ERK1/2 activation . The selective down-regulation of platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF)-dependent ERK1/2 activation in the GM3-reconstituted cells was due to the substantial decreases of PDGF alpha receptor mRNA and protein , but in the SM3-reconstituted cells PDGF alpha receptor expression was similar to mock cells . Thus , endogenously produced GM3 and SM3 differentially and distinctly regulate tumor-progression ability , that is , GM3 leads the transformed phenotype of J5 cells to promotion and SM3 to abrogation .
Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in humans . However , poor response to conventional therapeutic approaches , including chemotherapy , leads invariably to disease recurrence and progression . The organo-tin derivative triethyltin(IV)lupinylsulfide hydrochloride ( IST-FS 29 ) was identified and developed as potential antiproliferative agent in human cancer cell lines . However , for its peculiar chemical structure and good lipophilicity , this compound also appeared an eligible candidate for the treatment of gliobastoma cells . The present experiments were designed to explore the in vitro effects of IST-FS 29 on four human glioblastoma cell lines : A-172 , DBTRG.05MG , U-87MG and CAS-1 . The average IC50 values were obtained by MTT assay and ranged between 3 and 10 microM . Time-course assays with cell recovery after drug withdrawal , demonstrated marked cytotoxicity following exposure to IST-FS 29 for 8 , 24 and 72 h . Cultures treated for 8 h were able to partially re-grow by 144 h ; on the contrary , longer times of exposure did not allow surviving cells to recover from the damage and actively proliferate . Cell morphology of cultures exposed to IST-FS 29 was assessed by inverted light microscopy after 24 and 72 h and was more consistent with cell death by necrosis which included cell size reduction , vacuolation of cytoplasm , round dying cells . The present results and our previous data , in vitro and in vivo , indicate the relevant cytotoxic activity of this organo-tin compound and suggest that IST-FS 29 might be a promising novel agent to be developed for the treatment of malignant brain neoplasms .
The cellular mechanisms of anti-androgen-induced tumor regression have not been investigated in great detail . We have compared the induction of cell death in the androgen-dependent , non-invasive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line by Casodex and TNF-alpha . Both agents induce a dose and time-dependent decrease in cell viability in vitro . However , Casodex does not induce classical DNA fragmentation to oligonucleosomes typically induced by TNF-alpha , but rather induces cleavage to form intermediate 60 kb DNA fragments . RT-PCR based analysis demonstrates that in LNCaP cells Casodex coordinately alters the expression of steady-state level of mRNAs of several matrix metalloproteases and their cognate inhibitors ( most notably MMP2 and TIMP1 ) . Zymography and reverse zymography confirm that the ratio of metalloprotease(s) to inhibitor(s) is altered in favor of activation of the proteases . In a small percentage of the treated LNCaP cells , the activation of the extracellular matrix ( ECM)-proteases by Casodex also induces an invasive phenotype . The acquisition of an invasive phenotype is not seen when LNCaP cells are treated with TNF-alpha , and is not seen when the LNCaP cells are treated with both compounds simultaneously , suggesting that the phenomenon may be specific to particular classes of compounds . These observations have significant implications in the treatment of prostate cancer , since the appearance of a more aggressive phenotype following treatment is clearly undesirable .
Tea ( Camellia sinensis ) is one of the most popular beverages , consumed worldwide . The health promoting properties of tea have been attributed to its antioxidative polyphenolic constituents and their oxidative products . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy of a black tea infusion on azoxymethane induced colonic preneoplastic lesions , the aberrant crypt foci in Sprague-Dawley rats . Rats were injected with azoxymethane ( 15mg/kg.b.w. ) and received oral administration of 1% and 2% ( w/v ) tea infusions from the 1(st)day of carcinogen application . The treatment was continued for 12 weeks . The colons were then assessed for aberrant crypt foci and compared with the untreated carcinogen control group . In situ cell proliferation and in situ apoptosis were also estimated using Brdu incorporation and the TUNEL method , respectively . Aberrant crypt foci were reduced significantly ( by 44% in the 1% tea-treated and by about 40% in 2% tea-treated group ) . Significant decrease in proliferation and increase in apoptosis suggest a possible interplay between the two processes resulting in inhibition of colon carcinogenesis by black tea .
In the present study we examined the effects of menadione , a redox cycling agent , on structural changes of human osteosarcoma line 143B cells . It has been previously reported that menadione can cause necrotic or apoptotic cell death in a concentration- depending manner . In our experimental model , cells were treated with 100 microM menadione for 24 hours . Using electron microscopy technique cells carrying three kinds of morphological changes were detected : necrotic cells , apoptotic cells and those demonstrating a co-existence of apoptotic and necrotic features in one single cell .
Resveratrol , a phytoalexin found in grapes and wine , has been shown to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological properties and is believed to play a role in the chemoprevention of human cancer . Resveratrol has also been shown to induce antiproliferation and apoptosis of several leukemia cell lines . In the present study , we investigated the effect of resveratrol in adult T cell leukemia . Our present observations showed that resveratrol induced growth inhibition in all five human T cell lymphotrophic virus-1-infected cell lines examined , with 50% effective dose of 10.4-85.6 mM . In the resveratrol-treated cells , induction of apoptosis was confirmed by annexin V-based analyses and morphological changes . The most surprising observation was that resveratrol treatment resulted in a gradual decrease in the expression of survivin , an antiapoptotic protein , during cell apoptosis . These findings indicate that resveratrol inhibits the growth of human T cell lymphotrophic virus-1-infected cell lines , at least in part , by inducing apoptosis mediated by downregulation in survivin expression . In view of the accumulating evidence that survivin may be an important determinant of a clinical response in adult T cell leukemia , our present findings have led to the suggestion that resveratrol , a common constituent of the human diet , merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for this incurable disease .
This article describes evaluation of plasma membrane fluidity and intracellular SOD with relation to apoptotic death of cervical carcinoma cells after radiation therapy . Cells from biopsies of cancer patients ( stage IIIB ) prior to and 24 h after radiation dose of 2 Gy were examined . Plasma membrane fluidity , measured by fluorescence polarization of DPH incorporated into lipid bilayer and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activity , determined by epinephrine method , showed significant decrease but per cent apoptotic cells , as determined by annexin-V and TUNEL methods , were found increased by two folds after radiotherapy . It is suggested that decrease in DPH polarization in membrane , reduction in SOD activity and increased apoptosis in cervical cells of cancer patients treated with radiation may be consequent to oxidative damage induced by reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which may have implications in developing predictive protocol in cancer radiotherapy .
There is increasing evidence for the implication of tumor-derived angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors in controlling tumor growth in vivo . In this study , we documented the production of inhibitors of angiogenesis by pancreatic cancer cells and examined how changes in the balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors regulate tumor growth in vivo . The human pancreatic cancer cell line Hs-776T ( HS-W ) produces slow-growing tumors in SCID mice . Cells of a variant form ( HS-R ) of Hs-776T produced faster-growing tumors compared to HS-W . Characterization of HS-W and HS-R cells in vitro showed similar proliferation rates and production of the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) . Analyzes of anti-angiogenic factors showed comparable levels of angiostatin and thrombospondin 1 and 2 , but endostatin was only detected in conditioned media of HS-W cells and was absent in HS-R . Cell proliferation was similar in both tumor types in vivo , whereas HS-W tumors demonstrated increased apoptosis with a high percentage of apoptotic endothelial cells ( EC ) . Subsequently , VEGF was over-expressed in Hs-776T cells ( HS-VF ) , resulting in rapidly growing tumors and lowering tumor and EC apoptosis . Collectively , our study confirms that tumor growth is dependent on its ability to increase the angiogenic stimulus or to reduce the amounts of endogenous anti-angiogenic factors .
Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been implicated in cellular senescence , apoptosis , aging and aging-associated pathologies . Telomere shortening and genomic instability have also been associated with replicative senescence , aging and cancer . Here we show that mitochondrial dysfunction leads to telomere attrition , telomere loss , and chromosome fusion and breakage , accompanied by apoptosis . An antioxidant prevented telomere loss and genomic instability in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria , suggesting that reactive oxygen species are mediators linking mitochondrial dysfunction and genomic instability . Further , nuclear transfer protected genomes from telomere dysfunction and promoted cell survival by reconstitution with functional mitochondria . This work links mitochondrial dysfunction and genomic instability and may provide new therapeutic strategies to combat certain mitochondrial and aging-associated pathologies .
In our study we investigated the level of apoptosis in PBMCs and the serological level of sFas ( CD95/APO-1 ) in 22 patients with malignant melanoma ( 12 patients with unique cutaneous primary tumour and 10 patients with unique brain metastasis ) . The first determination was performed before tumour excision and the second at 6-7 months after excision . Results in patients with primary tumour in the first determination : 6 patients with over normal values in PBMCs apoptosis and 5 patients with increased values of sFas . In the second determination : apoptosis was increased in 5 patients and sFas level was increased in 4 cases . In patients with metastases in the first determination apoptosis of PBMC was increased in 7 cases and sFas in 5 cases . In the second determination apoptosis was increased in 4 cases and sFas was increased in 4 cases . Our results show that half of the investigated patients presented elevated values of PBMCs apoptosis and Fas receptor both before and 6-7 months after tumour excision . Apoptosis values for PBMCs and sFas values were with 1/4 higher than normals . There was no difference in clinical evolution of the patients with normal or increased values for studied parameters . Clinical evolution was performed for 1 year . The presence of increased values for PBMCs and sFas after tumour excision , primary or metastasis is surprising and hard to explain . It is possible that tumoral evolution induces a disregulation at PBMCs level or other cells level that persists unexpectedly , after tumour excision or apoptotic processes , in a certain level to be independent and anterior to tumour development .
Limited options for the treatment of prostate cancer have spurred the search for new therapies . One innovative approach is the use of targeted alpha therapy ( TAT ) to inhibit cancer growth , using an alpha particle emitting radioisotope such as ( 213)Bi . Because of its short range and high linear energy transfer ( LET ) , alpha-particles may be particularly effective in the treatment of cancer , especially in inhibiting the development of metastatic tumors from micro-metastases . Prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) is expressed in prostate cancer cells and the neovasculature of a wide variety of malignant neoplasms including lung , colon , breast and others , but not in normal vascular endothelium . The expression is further increased in higher-grade cancers , metastatic disease and hormone-refractory prostate cancer ( PCA ) . J591 is one of several monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) to the extracellular domain of PSMA . Chelation of J591 mab with ( 213)Bi forms the alpha-radioimmunoconjugate ( AIC ) . The objective of this preclinical study was to design an injectable AIC to treat human prostate tumors growing subcutaneously in mice . The anti-proliferative effects of AIC against prostate cancer were tested in vitro using the MTS assay and in vivo with the nude mice model . Apoptosis was documented using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase [ TdT]-mediated deoxyuridinetriphosphate [ dUTP ] nick end-labeling ( TUNEL ) assay , while proliferative index was assessed using the Ki-67 marker . We show that a very high density of PSMA is expressed in an androgen-dependent human PCA cell line ( LNCaP-LN3 ) and in tumor xenografts from nude mice . We also demonstrate that the AIC extensively inhibits the growth of LN3 cells in vitro in a concentration-dependent fashion , causing the cells to undergo apoptosis . Our in vivo studies showed that a local AIC injection of 50 microCi at 2 days post-cell inoculation gave complete inhibition of tumor growth , whereas results for a non-specific AIC were similar to those for untreated mice . Further , after 1 and 3 weeks post-tumor appearance , a single ( 100 microCi/100 microl ) intra-lesional injection of AIC can inhibit the growth of LN3 tumor xenografts ( volume<100 mm(3) ) in nude mice . Tumors treated with AIC decreased in volume from a mean 46+/-14 mm(3) in the first week or 71+/-15 mm(3) in the third week to non-palpable , while in control mice treated with a non-specific AIC using the same dose , tumor volume increased from 42 to 590 mm(3) . There were no observed side effects of the treatment . Because of its in vitro cytotoxicity and these anti-proliferative properties in vivo , the ( 213)Bi-J591 conjugate has considerable potential as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of prostate cancer .
Novel photosensitizers Hypocrellin A ( HA ) and Hypocrellin B ( HB ) , lipid soluble perylquinone derivatives of the genus Hypericum have a strong photodynamic effect on tumors and viruses . However , the mechanisms of tumor cell death induced by HA and HB are still unclear . In this study , we attempt to elucidate the photodynamic effects of HA and HB compounds in poorly differentiated ( CNE2 ) and moderately differentiated ( TW0-1 ) human nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) cells as well as human mucosal colon ( CCL-220.1 ) and bladder ( SD ) cells . Using these cell lines we investigated few hall marks of apoptotic commitments in a drug and light dose dependent manner . Tumor cells photoactivated with HA and HB showed cell size shrinkage and an increase in the sub-diploid DNA content . A loss of membrane phospholipid asymmetry associated with apoptosis was induced by all tumor cell lines as evidenced by the externalization of phosphatidylserine . Western blot analysis of poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase , a caspases substrate , showed the classical cleavage pattern ( 116 to 85kDa ) associated with apoptosis in HA and HB-treated cell lysates . In addition , PARP cleavage was blocked by using tetrapepdide caspases inhibitors such as DEVD or z-VAD . These results demonstrate that tumor cell death induced by HB and HA is mediated by caspase proteases . This study also identifies both colon and bladder cells were more sensitive cell lines than NPC ( CNE2 and TWO-1 ) cell lines .
We have investigated the cytotoxic activity , the induction of apoptosis , and the interstrand cross-linking efficiency in the A2780cisR ovarian tumor cell line , after replacement of the two NH3 nonleaving groups in trans-[PtCl2(NH3)2] ( trans-DDP ) by dimethylamine and isopropylamine . The data show that trans-[PtCl2(NH(CH)2)(NHCH(CH3)2)] is able to circumvent resistance to cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2] ( cis-DDP , cisplatin ) in A2780cisR cells . In fact , trans-[PtCl2(NH(CH3)2)(NHCH(CH3)2)] shows a cytotoxic potency higher than that of cis-DDP and trans-DDP , with the mean IC50 values being 11 , 58 , and 300 microM , respectively . In addition , at equitoxic doses ( concentrations of the platinum drugs equal to their IC50 values ) and after 24 hours of drug treatment , the level of induction of apoptosis by trans-[PtCl2(NH(CH3)2)(NHCH(CH3)2)] is twice that produced by cis-DDP . Under the same experimental conditions , trans-DDP does not induce significant levels of apoptosis in A2780cisR cells . After 24 hours of incubation of A2780cisR cells at concentrations equal to the IC0o value of the platinum drugs , the level of DNA interstrand cross-links ( ICLs ) induced by trans-[PtCI2(NH(CH)2)(NHCH(CH3)] is two and three times higher , respectively , than those induced by cis-DDP and trans-DDP . We also found that trans-[PtCl2(NH(CH3)2)(NHCH(CH3)2)] formed DNA ICLs between guanine and complementary cytosine . We propose that , in A2780cisR cells , the induction of apoptosis by trans-[PtCl2(NH(CH3)2)(NHCH(CH3)2)] is related to its greater ability ( relative to cis-DDP and trans-DDP ) to form DNA ICLs .
An aqueous extract of Kefir , fermented milk originally produced in the Caucasus mountains , suppressed morphological changes of human melanoma HMV-1 and SK-MEL cells and human normal fibroblastTIG-1 cells caused by UVC-irradiation , suggesting that UV damage can be suppressed by the Kefir extract . The addition of the Kefir extract after UVC-irradiation of HVM-1 cells resulted in a remarkable decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) which had been increased by UVC irradiation . The Kefir extract also stimulated unscheduled DNA synthesis and suppressed UVC-induced apoptosis of HMV-1 cells . A colony formation assay revealed that the Kefir extract rescued HMV-1 cells from cell death caused by UVC irradiation . The Kefir extract , as well as methyl methanethiosulfonate which is known to enhance the nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) activity , exhibited strong thymine dimer repair-enhancing activity . Epigalocatechin exhibited a weak NER activity but vitamins A , C , and E and catechin showed no NER activity . The thymine dimer repair-enhancing factors in the Kefir extract were heat-stable and assumed to be molecules with a molecular weight of less than 5000 . The treatment of HMV-1 cells with the Kefir extract during or before UVC- irradiation also prevented the generation of ROS and thymine dimmer , and suppressed the apoptosis of HMV-1 cells , suggesting that application of Kefir can prevent UV damage .
The glycolytic phenotype is a widespread phenomenon in solid cancer forms , including breast cancer . Dichloroacetate ( DCA ) has recently been proposed as a novel and relatively non-toxic anti-cancer agent that can reverse the glycolytic phenotype in cancer cells through the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase . We have examined the effect of DCA against breast cancer cells , including in a highly metastatic in vivo model . The growth of several breast cancer cell lines was found to be inhibited by DCA in vitro . Further examination of 13762 MAT rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells found that reversal of the glycolytic phenotype by DCA correlated with the inhibition of proliferation without any increase in cell death . This was despite a small but significant increase in caspase 3/7 activity , which may sensitize cancer cells to other apoptotic triggers . In vivo , DCA caused a 58% reduction in the number of lung metastases observed macroscopically after injection of 13762 MAT cells into the tail vein of rats ( P = 0.0001 , n > or = 9 per group ) . These results demonstrate that DCA has anti-proliferative properties in addition to pro-apoptotic properties , and can be effective against highly metastatic disease in vivo , highlighting its potential for clinical use .
Manganese , an essential trace nutrient in human beings , has been widely used in the steel industry to improve hardness , stiffness , and strength . With the increased applications of manganese compounds , discharge into the environment has rapidly increased and may exert adverse effects on human health . In this study , manganese toxicity was investigated using cultured T98G cells , which are derived from human glioblasts with the ability to differentiate into several different types of neuroglia . Cytotoxicity was shown in manganese-treated groups ( 100 , 200 , 400 , and 800microM of MnCl(2) ) , and cell viability was decreased to 58.8% of the control group at 2days after treatment with 800microM of MnCl(2) . When cells were treated with manganese for 24h , ROS dose-dependently increased while antioxidant intracellular GSH decreased . With the generation of ROS , the increased activity of caspase-3 was shown , and was followed by chromatin condensation and breakage , which is an indication of the cellular apoptotic process . ROS also triggered pro-inflammatory responses in cultured T98G cells , which were demonstrated by the increased gene expression and protein levels of IL-6 and IL-8 .
Most cancer cells exhibit increased glycolysis for generation of their energy supply . This specificity could be used to preferentially kill these cells . In this study , we identified the signaling pathway initiated by glycolysis inhibition that results in sensitization to death receptor ( DR)-induced apoptosis . We showed , in several human cancer cell lines ( such as Jurkat , HeLa , U937 ) , that glucose removal or the use of nonmetabolizable form of glucose ( 2-deoxyglucose ) dramatically enhances apoptosis induced by Fas or by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand . This sensitization is controlled through the adenosine monophosphate ( AMP)-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , which is the central energy-sensing system of the cell . We established the fact that AMPK is activated upon glycolysis block resulting in mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibition leading to Mcl-1 decrease , but no other Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic members . Interestingly , we determined that , upon glycolysis inhibition , the AMPK-mTOR pathway controlled Mcl-1 levels neither through transcriptional nor through posttranslational mechanism but rather by controlling its translation . Therefore , our results show a novel mechanism for the sensitization to DR-induced apoptosis linking glucose metabolism to Mcl-1 downexpression . In addition , this study provides a rationale for the combined use of DR ligands with AMPK activators or mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of human cancers .
The present study was designed to investigate the protective efficacy of eugenol against skin cancer and probe into the mechanistic aspects . Skin tumors were initiated by applying 160 nmol DMBA and promoted by twice weekly applications of 8.5 nmol TPA for 28 wk . All mice developed tumors by 13 wk of promotion . However , in mice pretreated with 30 microL eugenol , no tumors were detected until 8 wk ( following anti-initiation protocol ) and until 14 wk ( following antipromotion protocol ) of tumor promotion . PCNA and TUNEL immunohistochemistry of tumors revealed eugenol to ameliorate cell proliferation and elevate apoptosis respectively . The effect of eugenol was assessed on specific stages of carcinogenesis . Initiation with DMBA led to a significant upregulation of p53 expression with a concomitant increase in p21(WAF1) levels in epidermal cells indicating induction of damage to the DNA . However , pretreatment with eugenol led to overexpression of these genes , which probably helped stimulate apoptosis of the initiated cells . To ascertain the molecular mechanisms implicated in the antitumor promoting activity of eugenol , its effect was investigated on markers of tumor promotion and inflammation : ODC activity and iNOS and COX-2 expression , and on levels of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-6 , TNF-alpha , and PGE(2) ) . Eugenol markedly inhibited all . Eugenol also inhibited the upstream signaling molecule : NF-kappaB , which regulates the expression of these genes . TPA-induced depletion of cutaneous GSH and antioxidant enzymes armory was also precluded by eugenol . From these results , it could be concluded that eugenol markedly protects against chemically induced skin cancer and acts possibly by virtue of its antiproliferative , anti-inflammatory , and antioxidant activities .
PURPOSE Monoclonal anti-CD33 antibodies conjugated with toxic calicheamicin derivative ( gemtuzumab ozogamicin , GO ) are a novel therapy option for acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) . Key prognostic factors for patients with AML are high CD33 expression on the leukaemic cells and the ability to overcome mechanisms of resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapies , including drug efflux or other mechanisms decreasing apoptosis . Alpha particle-emitting radionuclides overwhelm such anti-apoptotic mechanisms by producing numerous DNA double-stranded breaks ( DSBs ) accompanied by decreased DNA repair . METHODS We labelled anti-CD33 antibodies with the alpha-emitter ( 211)At and compared survival of leukaemic HL-60 and K-562 cells treated with the ( 211)At-labelled antibodies , GO or unlabelled antibodies as controls . We also measured caspase-3/7 activity , DNA fragmentation and necrosis in HL-60 cells after treatment with the different antibodies or with free ( 211)At . RESULTS The mean labelling ratio of ( 211)At-labelled antibodies was 1:1,090 +/- 364 ( range : 1:738-1:1,722 ) in comparison to 2-3:1 for GO . Tumour cell binding of ( 211)At-anti-CD33 was high in the presence of abundant CD33 expression and could be specifically blocked by unlabelled anti-CD33 . ( 211)At-anti-CD33 decreased survival significantly more than did GO at comparable dilution ( 1:1,000 ) . No significant differences in induction of apoptosis or necrosis or DNA DSB or in decreased survival were observed after ( 211)At-anti-CD33 ( 1:1,090 ) versus GO ( 1:1 ) treatment . CONCLUSION Our results suggest that ( 211)At is a promising , highly cytotoxic radioimmunotherapy in CD33-positive leukaemia and kills tumour cells more efficiently than does calicheamicin-conjugated antibody . Labelling techniques leading to higher chemical yield and specific activities must be developed to increase ( 211)At-anti-CD33 therapeutic effects .
PURPOSE Anthracyclines have been widely used as antitumor agents , playing a crucial role in the successful treatment of many types of cancer , despite some side effects related to cardiotoxicity . New anthracyclines have been designed and tested , but the first ones discovered , doxorubicin and daunorubicin , continue to be the drugs of choice . Despite their extensive use in chemotherapy , little is known about the DNA repair mechanisms involved in the removal of lesions caused by anthracyclines . The anthracycline cosmomycin D is the main product isolated from Streptomyces olindensis , characterized by a peculiar pattern of glycosylation with two trisaccharide rings attached to the A ring of the tetrahydrotetracene . METHODS We assessed the induction of apoptosis ( Sub-G1 ) by cosmomycin D in nucleotide excision repair-deficient fibroblasts ( XP-A and XP-C ) as well as the levels of DNA damage ( alkaline comet assay ) . RESULTS Treatment of XP-A and XP-C cells with cosmomycin D resulted in apoptosis in a time-dependent manner , with highest apoptosis levels observed 96 h after treatment . The effects of cosmomycin D were equivalent to those obtained with doxorubicin . The broad caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK strongly inhibited apoptosis in these cells , and DNA damage induced by cosmomycin D was confirmed by alkaline comet assay . CONCLUSIONS Cosmomycin D induced time-dependent apoptosis in nucleotide excision repair-deficient fibroblasts . Despite similar apoptosis levels , cosmomycin D caused considerably lower levels of DNA damage compared to doxorubicin . This may be related to differences in structure between cosmomycin D and doxorubicin .
The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K)/Akt oncogenic pathway is critical in glioblastomas . Loss of PTEN , a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway or activated PI3K/Akt pathway that drive increased proliferation , survival , neovascularization , glycolysis , and invasion is found in 70%-80% of malignant gliomas . Thus , PI3K is an attractive therapeutic target for malignant glioma . We report that a new irreversible PI3K inhibitor , PX-866 , shows potent inhibitory effects on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in glioblastoma . PX-866 did not induce any apoptosis in glioma cells ; however , an increase in autophagy was observed . PX-866 inhibited the invasive and angiogenic capabilities of cultured glioblastoma cells . In vivo , PX-866 inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth and increased the median survival time of animals with intracranial tumors . We also assessed the potential of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) as a noninvasive method to monitor response to PX-866 . Our findings show that PX-866 treatment causes a drop in the MRS-detectable choline-to-NAA , ratio and identify this partial normalization of the tumor metabolic profile as a biomarker of molecular drug action . Our studies affirm that the PI3K pathway is a highly specific molecular target for therapies for glioblastoma and other cancers with aberrant PI3K/PTEN expression .
Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) is a cellular damage sensor that coordinates the cell cycle with damage-response checkpoints and DNA repair to preserve genomic integrity . However , ATM also has been implicated in metabolic regulation , and ATM deficiency is associated with elevated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . ROS has a central role in many physiological and pathophysiological processes including inflammation and chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis and cancer , underscoring the importance of cellular pathways involved in redox homeostasis . We have identified a cytoplasmic function for ATM that participates in the cellular damage response to ROS . We show that in response to elevated ROS , ATM activates the TSC2 tumor suppressor via the LKB1/AMPK metabolic pathway in the cytoplasm to repress mTORC1 and induce autophagy . Importantly , elevated ROS and dysregulation of mTORC1 in ATM-deficient cells is inhibited by rapamycin , which also rescues lymphomagenesis in Atm-deficient mice . Our results identify a cytoplasmic pathway for ROS-induced ATM activation of TSC2 to regulate mTORC1 signaling and autophagy , identifying an integration node for the cellular damage response with key pathways involved in metabolism , protein synthesis , and cell survival .
AIM Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer in the industrial countries . Due to advances regarding the treatments , primarily development of improved surgical methods and the ability to make the earlier diagnosis , the mortality has remained constant during the past decades even though the incidence in fact has increased . To improve chemotherapy and enable personalised treatment , the need of biomarkers is of great significance . In this study , we evaluated the gene expression profiles of the colon cancer cell lines treated with SN-38 , the active metabolite of topoisomerase-1 inhibitor irinotecan which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis . MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 3 colon cancer cell lines : KM12C , KM12SM and KM12l4a . The 3 cell lines were treated with SN-38 , and samples were obtained after 24 and 48 hour treatments . The gene expression analyses were performed using oligonucleotide microarrays comprising of approximately 27,000 spots where the untreated controls were compared to the SN-38-treated samples . RESULTS Unsupervised clustering clearly distinguished the treated cell lines from the untreated . Supervised analysis identified 3,974 significant genes ( p = 0.05 ) differentiating the treated samples from the untreated , majority of which were down-regulated after treatment . The top-ranked down-regulated genes in the treated cell lines included those related to receptor and kinase activity , signal transduction , apoptosis , RNA processing , protein metabolism and transport , cell cycle and transcription . A smaller number of genes were up-regulated in the cell lines after treatment and included genes involved in apoptosis , transcription , development and differentiation . CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that the expression of the genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as RNA , DNA and protein metabolism were affected by SN-38 . The impact of certain genes on colorectal cancer development needs to be further evaluated ; however , these results could serve as a basis for further studies in order to find targets for irinotecan treatment .
Hypoxia is widespread in solid tumors as a consequence of poorly structured tumor-derived neovasculature , which is recognized to play a role in the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy . Etoposide ( VP-16 ) , a drug commonly used in chemotherapy , leads to enhanced accumulation of cell populations in G2/M phase and increases levels of apoptosis as a topoisomerase II inhibitor . We evaluated the effects of hypoxia on the response of the neuroblastoma cell line CHP126 to VP-16 , in order to delineate the mechanisms responsible for the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance of this clinically conventional anti-cancer agent , with an insight to determining potential indications in neuroblastoma therapy . In this study , physiological hypoxia was shown to attenuate G2/M arrest and apoptosis induced in CHP126 cells by VP-16 . It suppressed drug-related Cdk1 activity with a less elevation of regulator proteins such as cyclin B1 , Cdk7 and reduced caspase activation and PARP cleavage compared to the efficiency observed in normoxic condition , which were significantly relative with hypoxia-driven inhibition of p53 and p-ERK1/2 activation . These results clearly demonstrated that hypoxia had a protective effect against VP-16-induced cytotoxicity , which is likely to provide a further therapeutic knowledge in neuroblastomas .
Although anticancer effect of gambogic acid ( GA ) and its potential mechanisms were well documented in past decades , limited information is available on the anticancer effect of gambogenic acid ( GNA ) , another major active component of Gamboge . Here we performed a study to determine whether GNA possesses anticancer effect and find its potential mechanisms . The results suggested that GNA significantly inhibited the proliferation of several tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo . Treatment with GNA dose and time dependently induced A549 cells apoptosis , arrested the cells to G0/G1 phase in vitro and down-regulated the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclooxygenase ( COX)-2 in mRNA level . In addition , anticancer effect was further demonstrated by applying xenografts in nude mice coupled with the characteristic of apoptosis in the GNA treated group . Taken together , these observations might suggest that GNA inhibits tumor cell proliferation via apoptosis-induction and cell cycle arrest .
BACKGROUND The pTalpha/preTCR regulates the beta-selection , a crucial T-cell developmental checkpoint , providing a most potent survival advantage to thymocytes mediated by the src-kinase p56(Lck) . METHODS To define the relevance of pTalpha in human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) , we analyzed in T-ALL cell lines ( n=14 ) pTalpha and p56(Lck) mRNA and protein expression as also the tyrosine-phosphorylation . The p56(Lck) specific src-protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( PTK-I ) PP1 was used in growth inhibition assays . IC(50) value determination , cell cycle- and apoptosis analyses were performed in T-ALL- , non-T-ALL- and murine transgenic cell lines . RESULTS pTalpha expression patterns were markedly different in T-ALL cell lines as compared to those reported for normal lymphoid counterparts . PP1 induced in 6/11 T-ALL cell lines a survival disadvantage resulting from a cell cycle arrest in the G(1/0) phase in thymic lymphoblastic cells and apoptosis induction in the immature cell line HSB-2 , respectively . PP1 sensitive cell lines expressed the target protein p56(Lck) and showed a corresponding P-Tyr signal . CONCLUSION Sensitivity of thymic T-ALLs to PP1 clearly underlines the impact of pTalpha mediated proliferation in this leukemic sub-type . In addition , p56(Lck) represents also independently of pTalpha a promising therapeutical target for the src-kinase inhibitors in neoplastic lymphoid diseases .
Prostate cancer ( PCA ) is the most common invasive malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in males . The present study investigated the effects of fangchinoline ( Fan ) , an important compound in Stephania Tetradra S. Moore ( Fenfangji ) with pain-relieving , blood pressure-depressing , and antibiotic activities , on human PCA . It was found that Fan inhibited human prostate cancer cell lines ( PC3 ) cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner . Studies of cell-cycle progression showed that the anti-proliferative effect of Fan was associated with an increase in the G1/S phase of PC3 cells . Western blot results indicated that Fan-induced G1/S phase arrest was mediated through inhibition of cyclin-regulated signaling pathways . Fan induced p27 expression and inhibited cyclin D and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) expression in PC3 cells . Increased exposure time to Fan caused apoptosis of PC3 cells , which was associated with up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and caspase 3 , and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 . Furthermore , Fan had anti-tumorigenic activity in vivo , including reduction of tumor volume and pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects in a PC3 nude mouse xenograft . Taking all this together , it can be concluded that Fan is an effective anti-proliferative agent that modulates cell growth regulators in prostate cancer cells .
OBJECTIVE To study the effects of genistein on the proliferation , apoptosis induction and expression of related gene proteins of human colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo , and its mechanisms of action . METHODS MTT colorimetric assay was used to detect the effects of genistein on the proliferation of human colon adenocarcinoma SW480 cells . Light and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the histological and ultrastructural changes . Flow cytometry was used to determine the effects of genistein on cell cycle and apoptosis . Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the effects of genistein on apoptosis induction and expression of related gene proteins of colon cancer cells . RESULTS The MTT colorimetric assay showed that genistein inhibited the proliferation of SW480 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner , and the highest inhibition rate was 60.2% after 80 microg/ml genistein treatment for 72 h . The light microscopy revealed that many genistein-treated cancer cells were shrunken , disrupted , or showing cytoplasmic vacuolization . The electron microscopic examination showed cell shrinkage , nuclear fragmentation and pronounced chromatin condensation , sometimes formed crescent chromatin condensation attached to the nuclear membrane . The results of flow cytometry showed that : after SW480 cells were treated with 0 , 20 , 40 , 80 microg/ml genistein for 48 h , the FI values of PCNA were 1.49 +/- 0.02 , 1.28 +/- 0.04 , 1.14 +/- 0.03 , and 0.93 +/- 0.08 ; the FI values of VEGF were 1.75 +/- 0.02 , 1.34 +/- 0.06 , 1.32 +/- 0.04 , and 1.23 +/- 0.04 ; the fluorescence index ( FI ) values of p21 were 1.26 +/- 0.05 , 1.36 +/- 0.06 , 1.61 +/- 0.03 , and 1.73 +/- 0.03 , respectively . There were statistically significant differences between the control group and each treatment group ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) . The scores of immunohistochemical staining of PCNA and VEGF proteins were decreased , while p21 increased . There were statistically significant differences between the control group and each treatment group ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSION Genistein can inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells via apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase . The anti-tumor mechanisms of genistein may be related with the down-regulation of expression of VEGF and PCNA , and up-regulation of the expression of p21 .
Targeting cancer cell metabolism is a new promising strategy to fight cancer . Metformin , a widely used antidiabetic agent , exerts antitumoral and antiproliferative action . In this study , the addition of metformin to 2-deoxyglucose ( 2DG ) inhibited mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in prostate cancer cells leading to a severe depletion in ATP . The combination of the two drugs was much more harmful for cancer cells than the treatment with metformin or 2DG alone , leading to 96% inhibition of cell viability in LNCaP prostate cancer cells . In contrast , a moderate effect on cell viability was observed in normal prostate epithelial cells . At the cellular level , the combination of metformin and 2DG induced p53-dependent apoptosis via the energy sensor pathway AMP kinase , and the reexpression of a functional p53 in p53-deficient prostate cancer cells restored caspase-3 activity . In addition to apoptosis , the combination of metformin and 2DG arrested prostate cancer cells in G(2)-M . This G(2)-M arrest was independent of p53 and correlated with a stronger decrease in cell viability than obtained with either drug . Finally , metformin inhibited 2DG-induced autophagy , decreased beclin 1 expression , and triggered a switch from a survival process to cell death . Our study reinforces the growing interest of metabolic perturbators in cancer therapy and highlights the potential use of the combination of metformin and 2DG as an anticancerous treatment .
1-(3-C-ethynyl-beta-d-ribo-pentofuranosyl)cytosine ( ECyd ) is a ribose-modified nucleoside analog of cytidine with potent anticancer activity in several cancers . The main antitumor mechanism of this promising RNA-directed nucleoside anti-metabolite is efficient blockade of RNA synthesis in cancer cells . Here , we examined the therapeutic potential of this RNA-directed anti-metabolite in in vitro models of nasopharyngeal cancer ( NPC ) . In a panel of 6 NPC cell lines , ECyd effectively inhibited cellular proliferation at nM concentrations ( IC(50) : approximately 13-44nM ) . Moreover , cisplatin-resistant NPC cells were highly sensitive to ECyd ( at nM concentration ) . The ECyd-mediated growth inhibition was associated with G(2)/M cell cycle arrest , PARP cleavage ( a hallmark of apoptosis ) and Bcl-2 downregulation , indicating induction of apoptosis by ECyd in NPC cells . Unexpectedly , ECyd-induced significant downregulation of TIGAR , a newly described dual regulator of apoptosis and glycolysis . More importantly , this novel action of ECyd on TIGAR was accompanied by marked depletion of NADPH , the major reducing power critically required for cell proliferation and survival . We hypothesized that ECyd-induced TIGAR downregulation was crucially involved in the antitumor activity of ECyd . Indeed , overexpression of TIGAR was able to rescue NPC cells from ECyd-induced growth inhibition , demonstrating a novel mechanistic action of ECyd on TIGAR . We demonstrated for the first time that an RNA-directed nucleoside analog , ECyd , exerts its antitumor activity via downregulation of a novel regulator of apoptosis , TIGAR . Moreover , ECyd may represent a novel therapy for NPC .
OBJECTIVE To analyze histological factors not routinely assessed as potential prognostic factors in renal cell carcinoma , such as tumor necrosis , microscopic vascular invasion , and sinus fat invasion . MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective , analytical study was conducted of surgical specimens from 139 patients with localized renal cell carcinoma who underwent nephrectomy from 1993 to 2005 . Tumor necrosis , microscopic vascular invasion , and sinus fat invasion were analyzed and compared to the classical factors : TNM classification , Fuhrman grade , and tumor size . For statistical analysis , variables analyzed were categorized as pT1 , 2 vs pT3 , 4 ; Fuhrman grade 1 , 2 vs 3 , 4 ; tumor size < 7 cm vs >or= 7cm ; tumor necrosis vs no tumor necrosis ; microvascular invasion of sinus fat vs no invasion . Cancer-specific survival probability and disease-free survival were calculated . A descriptive and analytical statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression for univariate and multivariate analyses . Dependent variables were used to analyze cancer-specific survival rates . Disease-free survival was estimated using a Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves . RESULTS In the univariate analysis , all variables analyzed had a significant influence on death for renal cell carcinoma . In the multivariate analysis , the variable having the greatest influence was Fuhrman grade ( p = 0,032 ) . The variables significantly influencing disease-free survival , estimated by the Cox method , were the pT stage ( p = 0.038 ) and Fuhrman grade ( p = 0.048 ) . CONCLUSIONS In patients with clinically localized renal cell carcinoma undergoing nephrectomy , pT stage and Fuhrman grade are the most important prognostic factors for survival and disease-free survival . Tumor necrosis , microscopic vascular invasion , and sinus fat invasion are prognostic factors for death from renal carcinoma which are associated to TNM classification , Fuhrman grade , and tumor size .
BACKGROUND Adenoid cystic carcinoma ( ACC ) of the Breast is a rare tumour ( less than 1 % of all breast carcinomas ) . The aim of this study was to determine the clinical , histological and immunohistochemical characteristics of these tumours . METHODS From the database of the Bergonie Institute of Bordeaux , 30 cases of ACC were identified . The clinical and histological features of these carcinomas were characterized . An immunohistochemical study was performed with the following antibodies : ER , PR , HER-2-neu , Vimentin , EGFR , P63 , SMA , CK5/6 , CK8/18 , CK14 , cKIT , MIB1 , CD44 and CD24 . RESULTS Thirty patients were included ( median age 60.7 years ) . The 10 axillary lymph node dissections and two sentinel lymph procedures were negative . The architecture was frequently of a mixed type ( 26/30 ) and less often solid ( 4/30 ) . Among the 23 patients for whom follow up was available ( median follow-up : 84 months [ 2-288] ) , there were three local recurrences and three metastatic events . The tumors with recurrence and metastasis showed more necrosis , a mitotic count greater than 4/10hpf , and in one case perineural infiltration . All the tumours were ER , PR and Her-2-neu negative . Morphological and immunophenotypical analysis disclosed in each tumor , a basaloid and a luminal cell population with divergent immunophenotypical patterns . CONCLUSIONS The mammary ACC is made of two cell types and is of good prognosis despite its triple negative phenotype , similar to the basal-like infiltrating carcinoma NOS . Axillary lymph node dissection is not recommended . Good local control by at least large lumpectomy with long-term follow-up is necessary .
OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of the category of unclassified renal cell carcinoma ( URCC ) on survival following nephrectomy . METHODS Patients with clear cell RCC ( ccRCC , n = 3048 ) and URCC ( n = 38 ) were identified . Patients with URCC were matched 4:1 with ccRCC patients based on year of surgery , symptoms at presentation , tumor size , stage , regional lymph node involvement , metastases , grade , coagulative tumor necrosis , and sarcomatoid differentiation . Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between ccRCC and URCC patients using log-rank tests . RESULTS Patients with URCC were more likely to have regional lymph node involvement ( P <.001 ) , higher grade ( P <.001 ) , tumor necrosis ( P <.001 ) , and sarcomatoid differentiation ( P <.001 ) as compared to patients with ccRCC . Overall survival was not significantly different between URCC and ccRCC patients in either the unmatched ( P = .337 ) or matched ( P = .345 ) cohorts . Cancer-specific survival was significantly worse for URCC patients compared with unmatched ccRCC patients ( P = .020 ) . However , this difference was not statistically significant when the URCC patients were compared with the matched cohort ( P = .688 ) . Distant metastases-free survival was somewhat worse for M0 URCC patients compared with unmatched M0 ccRCC patients ( P = .063 ) , but not in the matched cohort ( P = .788 ) . CONCLUSIONS Although URCC is more likely to present with advanced clinicopathologic features compared with ccRCC , no statistically significant differences in outcome were noted after adjusting for these features in a matched analysis .
Pilocytic astrocytoma is commonly viewed as a benign lesion . However , disease onset is most prevalent in the first two decades of life , and children are often left with residual or recurrent disease and significant morbidity . The Hedgehog ( Hh ) pathway regulates the growth of higher WHO grade gliomas , and in this study , we have evaluated the activation and operational status of this regulatory pathway in pilocytic astrocytomas . Expression levels of the Hh pathway transcriptional target PTCH were elevated in 45% of tumor specimens analyzed ( ages 1-22 years ) and correlated inversely with patient age . Evaluation of a tissue array revealed oligodendroglioma-like features , pilomyxoid features , infiltration , and necrosis more commonly in specimens from younger patients ( below the median patient age of 10 years ) . Immunohistochemical staining for the Hh pathway components PTCH and GLI1 and the proliferation marker Ki67 demonstrated that patients diagnosed before the age of 10 had higher staining indices than those diagnosed after the age of 10 . A significant correlation between Ki67 and PTCH and GLI1 staining indices was measured , and 86% of Ki67-positive cells also expressed PTCH . The operational status of the Hh pathway was confirmed in primary cell culture and could be modulated in a manner consistent with a ligand-dependent mechanism . Taken together , these findings suggest that Hh pathway activation is common in pediatric pilocytic astrocytomas and may be associated with younger age at diagnosis and tumor growth .
OBJECTIVES To investigate the effects of serotonin and melatonin ( MLT ) on the regulation of malignant growth and the activity of serotonin receptors ( 5HTR1a/-1b ) in prostate cancer ( PCa ) cell lines . MATERIALS AND METHODS In four PCa cell lines ( LNCaP , 22RV1 , PC3 , DU145 ) and two reference cell lines 5HTR1a and -1b , relative mRNA expression levels were assessed . Different serotonin and MLT receptor agonists and antagonists were used in stimulation and inhibition experiments . RESULTS mRNA expression of 5HTR1b was higher than that of 5HTR1a in all PCa cell lines . Serotonin showed a significant growth stimulatory effect in all PCa lines . The 5HTR1a and -1b agonists/antagonists did not significantly affect viability . MLT inhibited viability only in PC3 cells . Similarly , the 5HTR1a antagonist induced apoptotic changes in PC3 cells only at 10(-4)M , while the 5HTR1b antagonist induced necrosis at 10(-4)M in all cell lines . Cell cycle alterations were seen in PC3 and DU145 cells under the influence of the 5HTR1a antagonist . CONCLUSIONS Serotonin receptor antagonists and agonists as well as MLT influence viability and apoptosis of PCa cell lines at supraphysiologic concentrations . In contrast to other reports , our results do not support a regulatory role of serotonin or MLT receptor activation or inhibition in PCa growth .
Paragangliomas are relatively uncommon neoplasms that arise in adrenal and extra-adrenal paraganglia of the autonomic nervous system . Parasympathetic paraganglioma develop predominantly in the head and neck . It is exceedingly uncommon to develop a primary intraparathyroid paraganglioma . There is only a single case report in the English literature . The information from the single previous case report ( Medline 1960-2009 ) was combined with this case report . Our patient was a 69 year old woman who presented with a thyroid gland mass , with extension into the substernal space . The patient had a history of renal cell carcinoma removed 18 months before . At surgery , a thyroid lobectomy and a parathyroidectomy were performed . The parathyroid tissue showed a very well defined zellballen arrangement of paraganglion cells within the parenchyma of the parathyroid gland . The cells had ample basophilic , granular cytoplasm . The nuclei were generally round to oval with ' salt-and-pepper ' nuclear chromatin distribution . There was a richly vascularized stroma . Mitotic figures , necrosis , invasive growth , and profound nuclear pleomorphism were absent . The neoplastic cells were strongly and diffusely immunoreactive with chromogranin , synaptophysin , CD56 , and focally with cyclin-D1 . The paraganglioma showed a delicate S-100 protein positive supporting sustentacular framework . Keratin , CD10 , PTH , calcitonin and RCC markers were negative . The patient showed no stigmata of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia ( MEN ) and has no paraganglioma in any other anatomic site . She is alive without any additional findings 12 months after surgery . Isolated paraganglioma within the parathyroid is rare , and should be separated from parathyroid adenoma , hyperplasia or metastatic disease to assure appropriate management .
Ovarian smooth muscle tumors are a very rare type of ovarian tumor . In this paper , we report the case of a 62-year-old woman who had a huge smooth muscle tumor of the right ovary . The values of all the serum tumor markers were within normal limit . The tumor measured 25 cm in diameter and weighed 6,200 g . Histological examination revealed that coagulative cellular atypia was moderate to severe , necrosis was not present and mitotic index was low . According to the criteria for the evaluation of the uterine smooth muscle tumors , this huge tumor was diagnosed as atypical leiomyoma . However , we finally made a diagnosis of this tumor as a smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malignant potential ( STUMP ) because of its huge size . Further information is required regarding the characteristics of ovarian smooth muscle tumor and the propriety to introduce uterine tumor histological criteria to ovarian tumors .
OBJECTIVE Ovarian carcinomas mostly appear as large cystic masses . However , the exact prevalence of cysts in epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC ) has never been documented as well as the tumor factors that are related to the presence of cysts . Demonstrating the prevalence of cysts in EOC is essential for research focused on predictive and prognostic biomarkers in ovarian cyst fluid . STUDY DESIGN From 233 patients with primary EOC who underwent surgery , pathological data were collected from pathology reports . Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the relationship between the presence of cysts and other tumor characteristics . RESULTS Cysts in EOC were present in 83.7% of the patients and were mostly ( 61% ) multilocular . The most common histological subtypes ( serous , mucinous , endometrioid , clear cell ) contained cysts in more than 85% of the cases . In univariate regression analysis , early FIGO stage , low tumor grade and a large tumor size were significantly associated with the presence of cysts ( OR ( 95% CI)=5.312 ( 1.81-15.57 ) , 6.906 ( 2.31-20.66 ) and 1.169 ( 1.08-1.27 ) , respectively ) . In multivariate regression analysis , apart from tumor size , only tumor grade was independently associated with the presence of cysts ( adjusted OR ( 95% CI)=4.234 ( 1.36-13.22) ) . CONCLUSIONS The large majority of all EOCs contained cysts . Histological subtype , FIGO stage , tumor necrosis and age were not associated with the presence of cystic EOC . In contrast , tumor grade and tumor size were independently related to the presence of cystic EOC . This means that cystic EOCs represent a subgroup of larger and more well-differentiated tumors . The evident relationship between the presence of cysts and differentiation grade is interesting from a clinical point of view as grading is especially important for the prognosis and treatment of patients with stage I EOC .
PURPOSE Tamoxifen , a selective oestrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) , and brivanib alaninate , a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR-2 ) inhibitor , are two target specific agents that result in a substantial decrease in tumour growth when given alone . Tamoxifen activates SERM stimulated breast and endometrial tumour growth . Tamoxifen and brivanib alaninate have side-effects that can affect therapeutic outcomes . The primary goal of the current study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of lower doses of both agents when given in combination to mice with SERM sensitive , oestrogen stimulated tumour xenografts ( MCF-7 E2 tumours ) . Experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of SERM stimulated breast ( MCF-7 Tam , MCF-7 Ral ) and endometrial tumours ( EnCa 101 ) to demonstrate the activity of brivanib alaninate in SERM resistant models . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In the current study , tumour xenografts were minced and bi-transplanted into the mammary fat pads of athymic , ovariectomised mice . Preliminary experiments were conducted to determine an effective oral dose of tamoxifen and brivanib alaninate that had minimal effect on tumour growth . Doses of 125 microg of tamoxifen and 0.05 mg/g of brivanib alaninate were evaluated . An experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of the two agents together when started at the time of tumour implantation . An additional experiment was done in which tumours were already established and then treated , to obtain enough tumour tissue for molecular analysis . RESULTS Brivanib alaninate was effective at inhibiting tumour growth in SERM sensitive ( MCF-7 E2 ) and SERM stimulated ( EnCa 101 , MCF-7 Ral , MCF-7 Tam ) models . The effect of the low dose drug combination as an anti-tumour strategy for SERM sensitive ( MCF-7 E2 ) in early treatment was as effective as higher doses of either drug used alone . In established tumours , the combination is successful at decreasing tumour growth , while neither agent alone is effective . Molecular analysis revealed a decreased phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in tumours that were treated with brivanib alaninate and an increase in VEGFA transcription to compensate for the blockade of VEGFR-2 by increasing the transcription of VEGFA . Tamoxifen increases the phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and this effect is abrogated by brivanib alaninate . There was also increased necrosis in tumours treated with brivanib alaninate . CONCLUSION Historically , tamoxifen has a role in blocking angiogenesis as well as the blockade of the ER . Tamoxifen and a low dose of an angiogenesis inhibitor , brivanib alaninate , can potentially be combined not only to maximise therapeutic efficacy but also to retard SERM resistant tumour growth .
It has been shown that injecting a suspension of IFN-gamma-secreting tumor cells results in their rejection . This effect has been attributed to IFN-gamma preventing tumor stroma formation but not to a direct effect on the cancer cells . However , it is not known , which influence IFN-gamma has on tumors with an established stroma . To address this question , the plasmacytoma cell line J558L was transduced with a vector allowing doxycycline-inducible IFN-gamma gene expression . After the injection of the tumor cells into mice , IFN-gamma was induced at different time points . Tumors did not grow when inducing IFN-gamma immediately after tumor cell inoculation , while approximately half of the tumors were rejected when IFN-gamma was induced in early established tumors within 2 weeks . Induction of IFN-gamma 2-3 weeks after tumor cell inoculation was less efficient ( 0-17% rejection ) . IFN-gamma induction in established tumors led to a reduction of CD146(+) endothelial cells and massive necrosis . Together , we show that vascularized tumors can be rejected by local IFN-gamma expression , but that rejection of established tumors was less efficient over time . This suggests that transplanted tumors became less susceptible to local IFN-gamma treatment the better they are established .
Certain hexavalent chromium ( Cr(VI) ) compounds are well established occupational respiratory tract carcinogens . However , despite extensive studies , the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Cr(VI)-induced lung cancer remain poorly understood . In fact , the models used were often suboptimal and yielded conflicting results that were heavily dependent upon the system and experimental conditions employed . Here , we investigated the effects of chronic subcytotoxic and mildly cytotoxic ( 0.1-2 microM ) Cr(VI) exposures on cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells , the main targets of Cr(VI) carcinogenicity . Our studies with the nontumorigenic BEAS-2B cell line suggest that relatively short exposures ( h ) to sublethal Cr(VI) doses ( 0.1-1 microM ) may render these cells less sensitive to contact inhibition . We have also observed a reduced sensitivity to Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis shortly after the beginning of exposure to a mildly cytotoxic Cr(VI) dose ( 2 microM ) . Further studies are needed to determine whether these two phenotypes are involved in the Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenic process . Additionally , evidence gathered in this study strongly points to a Cr(VI) interference with cell adhesion to the substratum and with cell-cell interactions . Finally , by chronically exposing BEAS-2B cells to mildly cytotoxic Cr(VI) doses ( 1 and 2 microM ) , we were able to induce changes in cell morphology and pattern of growth characteristic of an early phase of pre-malignant progression .
We report that all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) in combination with zoledronic acid has strong synergistic cytotoxic and apoptotic effects against human hormone- and drug-refractory prostate cancer cells , PC-3 and DU-145 , in a time- and dose-dependent manner . We further investigated the effect of the combination treatment on the apoptotic process by both oligoarray and protein array analysis in DU-145 cells , in which the drug combination shows much more strong synergistic effects , as compared to PC-3 cells . Moreover , we have also performed real time-PCR array analysis to validate oligoarray results . We demonstrated that the combination of ATRA and zoledronic acid is a strong inducer of apoptotic related cell death in human androgen-and drug refractory prostate cancer cells DU-145 , at either transcriptional or translational levels . While expression of proapoptotic genes such as tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily ( TNFRSF ) , Bad , Bax , Fas , FADD are induced with the exposure of the combination , expression of antiapoptotic genes or proteins such as members of inhibitor apoptosis family ( IAPs ) , MCL-1 , LTBR , p53 and bcl-2 are reduced . Because this novel combination treatment has fewer side effects than is generally the case with conventional cytotoxic agents , this regimen may be a good option for treatment of elderly prostate cancer patients .
We have investigated the possibility that photoexcited titanium dioxide ( TiO2 ) could inhibit the growth of malignant cells . We studied the anti-glioma effects of nano-TiO2 excited with ultraviolet A ( UVA ) irradiation both in vitro and in vivo . Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that glioma cells take up TiO2 by phagocytosis , and vital staining revealed that TiO2 alone has no effect on glioma cell proliferation . However , if TiO2 was combined with UVA irradiation the proliferation rate was decreased significantly compared to controls ( P<0.05 ) . RT-PCR suggested that TiO2 induction of glioma cell apoptosis is associated with changes in the expression of genes encoding Bcl-2 family members . We then investigated the in vivo antitumor effects of combined TiO2 plus UVA treatment of established glioma tumors . TiO2 plus UVA led to pronounced areas of necrosis , elevated indices of apoptosis , delayed tumor growth , and increased survival compared with the TiO2-alone control group ( P<0.001 ) . Log-rank survival analysis showed that median survival duration was prolonged ( P<0.001 ) . These findings suggest that nano-TiO2 based photodynamic therapy has potential in the treatment of glioma .
OBJECTIVE To study the effect of Zilongjin ( ZLJ , a composite Chinese drug ) on proliferation and apoptosis of human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 . METHODS MCF-7 cells were randomly divided into four groups depending on the culture solution used , the control group , cultured with 1640 medium not contained ZLJ ; and the three ZJL groups cultured with medium contained low ( 1.5 mg/mL ) , moderate ( 3 mg/mL ) and high ( 6 mg/mL ) dosage of ZLJ crude drug respectively . The changes of cell proliferation were assessed by cell growth curve assay and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT ) assay . And the cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry , Hoechst 33342 staining and DNA ladder assay . RESULTS Compared with that in the normal control , the counts of cells in the three ZLJ groups were decreased significantly ( P<0.05 ) at such time point as 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 , 120 , and 144 h . Furthermore , apart from the comparison of the growth inhibition rate between the low and moderate dosage group at 24 and 72 h which were found to be no significant difference ( P>0.05 ) , the comparison f that among the three ZLJ groups appeared to be significant difference ( P<0.05 ) . The inhibitory effect of ZLJ on cell proliferation of MCF-7 was time- and dose-dependent ; it could retard cells in G0/G1 cell phase ; apoptosis of MCF-7 cell was induced by moderate and high dosage of ZLJ with revealing of apoptotic body and DNA ladder formation . CONCLUSION ZLJ shows cell proliferation inhibitory and apoptosis inducing effects on human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 , and thus to realize its anti-tumor action .
BACKGROUND Paclitaxel and pirarubicin exhibit cytotoxic and antitumor activities . However , little is known about the apoptosis-inducing effects of paclitaxel and pirarubicin on human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells . METHODS The effects of paclitaxel and pirarubicin on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were studied in MG-63 cells using flow cytometry . PCNA , Bcl-2 , Bax , cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression was assessed by Western blotting . RESULTS Paclitaxel and pirarubicin caused G2/M and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in MG-63 cells , respectively . Apoptosis of MG-63 cells mediated by paclitaxel was dependent on treatment duration . Interestingly , in cells treated with pirarubicin , apoptosis was related to treatment duration at concentrations of 10(2)-10(3) nM , whereas the effect of treatment duration was less marked at concentrations >10(4)-10(5) nM . Furthermore , paclitaxel and pirarubicin suppressed the expression of PCNA , cyclin D1 , cyclin E and Bcl-2 , and increased Bax expression . CONCLUSION These results suggest that the G2/M or G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by paclitaxel and pirarubicin are Bcl-2/Bax dependent , suggesting favorable effects of combination therapy with paclitaxel and pirarubicin in the treatment of osteosarcoma .
INTRODUCTION Astrocytic gliomas are the most common intracranial central nervous system neoplasias , accounting for about 60% of all primary central nervous system tumors . Despite advances in the treatment of gliomas , no effective therapeutic approach is yet available ; hence , the search for a more realistic model to generate more effective therapies is essential . OBJECTIVE To develop an experimental malignant astrocytoma model with the characteristics of the human tumor . METHOD Primary cells from subcutaneous xenograft tumors produced with malignant astrocytoma U87MG cells were inoculated intracerebrally by stereotaxis into immunosuppressed ( athymic ) Rowett rats . RESULTS All four injected animals developed non-infiltrative tumors , although other glioblastoma characteristics , such as necrosis , pseudopalisading cells and intense mitotic activity , were observed . CONCLUSION A malignant astrocytoma intracerebral xenograft model with poorly invasive behavior was achieved in athymic Rowett rats . Tumor invasiveness in an experimental animal model may depend on a combination of several factors , including the cell line used to induce tumor formation , the rat strains and the status of the animal's immune system .
OBJECTIVE As we previously demonstrated , the inhibitory effect of iodine on thyroid cell growth is mediated by iodolactones , especially 6-iodo-5-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid ( delta-iodolactone ) . In this communication we compare the effect of iodide , molecular iodine and delta-iodolactone on growth inhibition and apoptosis on three human thyroid carcinoma cell lines ( B-CPAP cells , FTC-133 cells and 8505C cells ) as well as on human breast cancer cells ( MCF 7 ) . METHODS Thyroid carcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium ( DMEM ) and MCF 7 cells in Rowswell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) culture medium , both containing 10% ( v/v ) Fetal Calf Serum ( FCS ) , until they were confluent . Around 2000 cells were then distributed in 12-well plates and grown for 48 h in either DMEM ( thyroid cancer cells ) or in RPMI medium ( MCF 7 cells ) both containing 5% FCS . Thereafter , different concentrations of iodide , iodine or delta-iodolactone were added for 24 h . Growth rate was estimated by cell counting in a Coulter Counter adapted for epithelial cells . Apoptosis was determined by a mitochondrial potential assay . RESULTS The growth rate of B-CPAP cells was unaffected by iodide , but was reduced by high concentreations of molecular iodine ( 100 and 500 microM ) . However , delta-iodolactone significantly reduced cell proliferation already with low concentrations ( 5 microM and 10 microM ) and further in a dose-dependent manner up to 82% . FTC-133 and 8505C cells were unaffected by iodide , iodine or delta-iodolactone . In contrast , in MCF 7 cells , molecular iodine ( 100 microM ) inhibited growth from 100% to 83% but delta-iodolactone ( 1 , 5 and 10 microM ) dose-dependently decreased growth rate from 100% to 82% and 62% , respectively . The inhibition of growth was through apoptosis , and not necrosis , as the amount of apoptotic cells corresponded to the growth inhibition . CONCLUSION delta-Iotaodolactone seems to be the main iodocompound which can inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in B-CPAP cells as well as in MCF 7 breast cancer cells .
The development and progression of esophageal cancer is associated with multiple alterations in the genome , including loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from the chromosome 10 ( PTEN ) gene . The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of adenovirus-mediated MMAC/PTEN expression on the growth and survival of human esophageal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo . We found that compared to control cells , overexpression of PTEN significantly suppressed growth and induced apoptosis in esophageal cancer cell lines Eca-109 and TE-1 via downregulation of Bcl-2 expression and changes in cell-cycle progression . Adenovirus PTEN also inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumor xenografts by significantly reducing tumor size in vivo . Thus our results confirm the proposed functional role of MMAC/PTEN as a regulator of esophageal cancer progression in vivo and in vitro . PTEN might be an important biological marker and potential therapeutic target in the treatment of human esophageal cancer .
OBJECTIVE To study the effect of anandamide ( AEA ) on necrosis in HepG2 cells and to explore the role of AEA in progression of liver cancer . METHODS Localization of the fatty acid hydrolytic enzyme ( FAAH ) , cannabinoid receptors 1(CB1) and cannabinoid receptors 2 ( CB2 ) proteins was detected in L02 and HepG2 cells using immunofluorescence . L02 and HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations of AEA and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin , and the rates of cells necrosis were examined by PI stain . Meanwhile , the expression levels of FAAH , CB1 and CB2 receptor proteins , as well as P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p-P38 MAPK ) and c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase ( p-JNK ) proteins , were analyzed by Western blot . RESULTS The FAAH , CB1 and CB2 receptor proteins were observed both in cytoplasm and on membrane in L02 and HepG2 cells . The expression level of FAAH protein was higher in HepG2 than in L02 cells . The expression level of CB1 receptor protein was very low in both L02 and HepG2 cells . The expression level of CB2 receptor protein was high in both L02 and HepG2 cells . AEA treatment induced necrosis in HepG2 cells but not in L02 cells . Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin treatment prevented necrosis in HepG2 cells ( t = 3.702 ; 5.274 ; 3.503 , P less than 0.05 ) . The expression patterns of FAAH , CB1 and CB2 receptor protein in L02 and HepG2 cells were confirmed by western blot , which were consistent with the immunofluorescence results . AEA treatment increased the levels of p-P38MAPK and p-JNK proteins in a dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells ( F = 11.908 ; 26.054 , P less than 0.05 ) and the increase can be partially by prevented by MCD ( t = 2.801 ; t = 12.829 , P less than 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION AEA treatment induces necrosis in HepG2 cells via CB1 and CB2 receptors and lipid rafts .
Thyroid-like low-grade nasopharyngeal papillary adenocarcinoma ( LGNPPA ) is extremely rare ; only four cases have been reported . Herein are presented the case reports of two Japanese male patients with thyroid-like LGNPPA . Macroscopically , these tumors were pedunculated polypoid masses on the roof of the nasopharynx . Microscopically , they were characterized by papillary and glandular epithelial proliferation . The papillae were complex and tightly packed with hyalinized fibrovascular cores and lined by columnar and pseudostratified cells with intervening spindle-shaped cells . Both cell types had round to oval vesicular nuclei with tiny nucleoli and mildly eosinophilic cytoplasm . Mitotic figures were not evident and necrosis was not observed . Psammoma bodies were seen focally in one of the patients . Transition from normal surface epithelium to tumor cells was identified in both cases . On immunohistochemistry the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin ( CK)7 , CK19 , thyroid transcription factor-1 ( TTF-1 ) and vimentin . They were negative for CK5/6 , CK20 , thyroglobulin , S-100 protein and CD15 . In situ hybridization for EBV was negative . Nasopharyngeal tumors with similar morphological appearance should be examined for TTF-1 immunoreactivity , and patients should be clinically followed to determine the course of this unusual disease and the significance of TTF-1 expression .
Principal components analysis ( PCA ) combined to Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) microspectroscopic imaging was used to screen biochemical changes associated to C6 glioma tumor from 7 to 19 days growth . Normal brain and tumor obtained at 7 , 12 , 19 days after C6 cell injection were used to develop a diagnostic model of brain glioma based on PCA analysis . This classification model was validated using extra-measurements on normal and tumor at 9 and 15 days post-implantation . The spatial and biochemical information obtained from FTIR/PCA maps can be used to improve the discrimination between normal and grading human glioma . The first 4 PCs which account for more than 93.6% of total spectral variance were used to construct pseudo-color scores maps and compared each map to the corresponding hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) staining . Our results reported that by correlating pseudocolor map scores with H&E staining it was possible to screen histological changes associated with tissue transformation . In fact , PC1 and PC4 were associated to the tumor , surrounding tumor and necrosis . Indeed , at day 7 after tumor implantation , FTIR investigations displayed a very small abnormal zone associated with the proliferation of C6 cells in the caudate putamen ( CP ) . PC2 and PC3 described normal brain structures such as white matter ( corpus callosum ( CC ) and commissura anterior ( CA) ) and some cortex layers ( grey matter ) . After delipidation of the tissues , we were still able to differentiate between different tissue features based on nucleic acid and protein content . By comparing the patterns of the PC loads with the spectra of lipids extracted from white and gray matters , and DNA , we have identified some biochemical changes associated with tissue transformation . This work demonstrated that our classification model provides a successful histological classification of different brain structures .
OBJECTIVE To study the clinicopathologic features , immunophenotype and ultrastructural features of sinonasal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors ( IMT ) . METHODS The clinical and histologic features of 5 cases of sinonasal IMT were reviewed . Immunohistochemical study for vimentin , MSA , SMA , calponin , h-caldesmon , desmin , ALK , fibronectin , CK , S-100 and Ki-67 was carried out . Ultrastructural examination was also performed in two of the cases . RESULTS The patients age ranged from 28 to 62 years ( mean = 43 years ) . The male-to-female ratio was 2:3 . The clinical presentation included nasal obstruction , nasal discharge , nasal bleeding , facial pain , facial swelling , toothache and tear overflow . All of the 5 patients suffered from disease relapses ; and 4 of them had recurrences for more than 5 times . One patient had lymph node metastasis and 3 patients died of the disease . Histologically , the tumor cells were arranged in interlacing fascicles and sometimes haphazard in fashion . They were spindly in shape , cytoplasm eosinophilic with mild nuclear atypia and a low mitotic activity . The intervening stroma was myxoid in appearance accompanied by lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration , abundant blood vessels and focal collagenized areas . In 3 of the recurrent cases , the tumor cells displayed increased nuclear atypia and mitotic activity ( average about 5 to 6 per 10 high-power fields ) , accompanied by patchy necrosis , less inflammatory cell infiltration and focal sarcomatous changes . Immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for vimentin . SMA , MSA , calponin and fibronectin were variably expressed . Desmin was weakly positive in 1 case . The staining for h-caldesmon , ALK , S-100 and CK was negative . The Ki-67 proliferation index increased with tumor recurrences . Electron microscopy revealed abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and dense body formation in the cytoplasm . There were an increased amount of collagen fibers in the stroma . CONCLUSIONS IMT rarely occurs in nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses . The tumor is prone to local invasion and recurrences , with subsequent progression to frank malignancy and distant metastasis , resulting in high mortality and poor prognosis . Complete surgical resection remains the main modality of treatment .
Abstract The use of immunotherapeutics in melanoma has received much attention , and recent advances to further characterize the regulatory components of the immune system and the importance of co-stimulatory molecules have opened a new area for clinical investigation . Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 ( CTLA-4 ) serves as a negative regulator of immunity . Recent trials administering fully human anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies to melanoma patients have demonstrated clinically meaningful responses . Treatment with CTLA-4 blocking antibodies , however , is not without potential toxicities . Autoimmune side-effects , the most common being colitis-associated diarrhea , are frequently associated with clinical responses . In efforts to build upon prior vaccination efforts as well as attempt to offer patients clinically meaningful immune responses with a CTLA-4 blockade but without significant toxicities , we conducted a clinical trial in patients who previously received autologous tumor cells engineered to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor ( GVAX ; Cell Genesys , South San Francisco , CA , USA ) with periodic infusions of CTLA-4 blocking antibodies . This sequential treatment resulted in clinically significant anti-tumor immunity without grade 3 or 4 toxicity in most patients . Pathological analyses following treatment of pre-existing tumors revealed a linear correlation between tumor necrosis and the ratio of intra-tumoral CD8+ effector cells to FoxP3+ regulatory cells ( T(regs) ) . Effective anti-tumor immunity and serious autoimmunity can be disassociated . Further targeting of anti-tumor T(regs)in combinatorial therapy approaches may be a rich avenue of future investigation .
Pam3CSK4 , a synthetic TLR2 ligand , has been shown to expand CD4+ regulatory T cells ( Treg cells ) . Less is known about the function of CD8+ Treg cells than about the function of CD4+ Treg cells generated during allergen-specific immunotherapy ( IT ) . This study investigated whether Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-specific IT could expand the CD8+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg population and whether Pam3CSK4 could enhance the Treg population . PBMCs were isolated from healthy control subjects and from mite-sensitive asthmatic patients during IT at three specific times : before IT and 6 mo and 1 y after the maximum-tolerated dose . This study was performed without a placebo-controlled group . D. pteronyssinus-specific IT induced a significant increase in CD8+Foxp3+ Treg cells expressing intracellular IL-10 and granzyme B. Costimulation of PBMCs with Pam3CSK4 and D. pteronyssinus 2 expanded the CD8+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg population and inhibited D. pteronyssinus 2-induced IL-4 production . Pam3CSK4-treated CD8+CD25+ Treg cells directly suppressed CD4+ T cell proliferation by cell-contact inhibition . TUNEL revealed that CD8+CD25+ Treg cells , but not CD4+CD25+ Treg cells , directly induced CD4+CD45ROhi+ apoptosis . Our results provide direct evidence that Pam3CSK4 induces an immunomodulatory effect by inducing CD8+ Treg cells ; therefore , it may be a good adjuvant for the treatment of mite allergies .
OBJECTIVES Toxicity caused by pharmacological and chemical substances , including carbon tetrachloride ( CCl(4) ) , is a major pathological factor for liver injury . Therefore , strategies to prevent toxicity are needed for maintaining a healthy liver . This study was designed to determine whether recombinant bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor ( rBPTI ) , a non-specific serine protease inhibitor , prevents CCl(4)-induced liver injury in mice . METHODS Mice were treated with CCl(4) in the presence or absence of co-treatment with rBPTI . Liver sections were prepared for histopathological assessment . Liver function was evaluated by detecting serum levels of alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and liver index . Liver oxidative stress and inflammation were examined by detecting the liver malondialdehyde level and glutathione and superoxide dismutase activity , and serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha level , respectively . KEY FINDINGS CCl(4) induced hepatocyte necrosis , inflammatory cell infiltration and fatty degeneration , which were ameliorated by co-treatment with rBPTI in a concentration-dependent manner . Furthermore , rBPTI prevented CCl(4)-induced disruption of liver function . Importantly , rBPTI reduced CCl(4)-induced liver oxidative stress response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production . CONCLUSIONS These results indicated that rBPTI exerted a protective effect on CCl(4)-induced liver injury in mice . Thus , rBPTI may have potential application for prevention of liver injury induced by metabolism of drugs and toxic substances .
In order to increase the permeability of cell membranes for low doses of cytostatic drugs , two bioelectrochemical methods have been compared : ( a ) electric pore formation in the plasma membranes by single electric impulses ( electroporation ) , and ( b ) reordering of membrane structure by alternating currents ( capacitively coupled ) . These treatments were applied to human leukemic K-562 cells and human lymphoma U-937 cells , yielding apoptotic and necrotic effects , determined by flow cytometry . Additional cell death occurs after exposure to light irradiation at wavelengths lambda > 600 nm , of cells which were electroporated and had incorporated actinomycin-C or daunomycin ( daunorubicin ) . It is observed that drug uptake after an exponentially decaying electroporation pulse of the initial field strength Eo=1.4 kV/cm and pulse time constants in the time range 0.5-3 ms is faster than during PEMF-treatment , i.e. , application of an alternating current of 16 kHz , voltage U<100 V , I=55 mA , and exposure time 20 min . However , at the low a.c. voltage of this treatment , more apoptotic and necrotic cells are produced as compared to the electroporation treatment with one exponentially decaying voltage pulse . Thus , additional photodynamic action appears to be more effective than solely drugs and electroporation as applied in clinical electrochemotherapy , and more effective than the noninvasive pulsed electromagnetic fields ( PEMFs ) , for cancer cells in general and animals bearing tumors in particular .
INTRODUCTION Necrosis at the tumor center is a common feature of aggressive breast cancers and has been associated with poor prognosis . It is commonly identified by means of invasive histopathology , which often correlates with morbidity and potential tumor cell dissemination , and limits the reconstruction of the whole necrotic domain . In this study we hypothesized that non covalent association to serum albumin ( SA ) and covalent binding to ligands for tumor-abundant cell receptors should synergistically drive selective accumulation and prolonged retention of imaging and therapeutic agents in breast tumor necrotic domains enabling in vivo identification , imaging and possibly treatment of such tumors . METHODS Cyclo-Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys ( c(RGDfK) ) were conjugated to bacteriochlorophyll-derivatives ( Bchl-Ds ) , previously developed as photodynamic agents , fluorescent probes and metal chelators in our lab . The c(RGDfK) component drives ligation to alphaVbeta3 integrin receptors over-expressed by tumor cells and neo-vessels , and the Bchl-D component associates to SA in a non-covalent manner . STL-6014 , a c(RGDfK)-Bchl-D representative , was i.v. injected to CD-1 , nude female mice bearing necrotic and non-necrotic human MDA-MB-231-RFP breast cancer tumors . The fluorescence signals of the Bchl-Ds and RFP were monitored over days after treatment , by quantitative whole body imaging and excised tumor/tissue samples derived thereof . Complementary experiments included competitive inhibition of STL-6014 uptake by free c(RGDfK) , comparative pharmacokinetics of nonconjugated c(RGDfK) Bchl-D ( STL-7012 ) and of two human serum albumin ( HSA ) conjugates : HSA-STL-7012 and HSA-STL-6014 . RESULTS STL-6014 and STL-7012 formed complexes with HSA ( HSA/STL-6014 , HSA/STL-7012 ) . STL-6014 , HSA-STL-7012 and HSA-STL-6014 , selectively accumulated at similar rates , in tumor viable regions over the first 8 h post administration . They then migrated into the necrotic tumor domain and presented tumor half lifetimes ( T1/2 ) in the range of days where T1/2 for HSA-STL-6014 > STL-6014 > HSA-STL-7012 . No accumulation of STL-7012 was observed . Pre-injection of c(RGDfK) excess , prevented the uptake of STL-6014 in the small , but not in the large tumors . CONCLUSIONS Non-covalent association to SA and covalent binding to c(RGDfK) , synergistically enable the accumulation and prolonged retention of Bchl-Ds in the necrotic regions of tumors . These findings provide novel guidelines and strategy for imaging and treatment of necrotic tumors .
Overexpression/amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER)2/neu ( erbB-2 ) oncogene plays a causal role in carcinogenesis and correlates with a poor clinical prognosis . However , little is known about HER2 in gastric cancer . In this study , we explored the pharmacological activities of natural triterpenoid corosolic acid ( CRA ) in HER2 signaling and its role in gastric cancer development and progression . In this study , CRA dramatically inhibited HER2 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner , effectively inhibited cell proliferation , and induced G(0)/G(1) arrest through the induction of p27(kip1) and cyclin D(1) down-regulation . CRA exposure enhanced apoptotic cell death , as confirmed by caspase-3 and poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase cleavage activities . CRA inhibited signaling pathways downstream of HER2 , including phospho-proteins such as Akt and Erk . In addition , CRA combined with adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil enhanced this growth inhibition , but not with docetaxel and paclitaxel . These findings demonstrate that CRA suppresses HER2 expression , which in turn promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death of gastric cancer cells , providing a rationale for future clinical trials of CRA in the treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancers .
Autophagy is activated in response to cellular stressors and mediates lysosomal degradation and recycling of cytoplasmic material and organelles as a temporary cell survival mechanism . Defective autophagy is implicated in human pathology , as disruption of protein and organelle homeostasis enables disease-promoting mechanisms such as toxic protein aggregation , oxidative stress , genomic damage , and inflammation . We previously showed that autophagy-defective immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cells are susceptible to metabolic stress , DNA damage , and genomic instability . We now report that autophagy deficiency is associated with endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and oxidative stress , and with deregulation of p62-mediated keratin homeostasis in mammary cells , allograft tumors , and mammary tissues from genetically engineered mice . In human breast tumors , high phospho(Ser73)-K8 levels are inversely correlated with Beclin 1 expression . Thus , autophagy preserves cellular fitness by limiting ER and oxidative stress , a function potentially important in autophagy-mediated suppression of mammary tumorigenesis . Furthermore , autophagy regulates keratin homeostasis in the mammary gland via a p62-dependent mechanism . High phospho(Ser73)-K8 expression may be a marker of autophagy functional status in breast tumors and , as such , could have therapeutic implications for breast cancer patients .
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive cancer with a greater than 95% mortality rate and short survival after diagnosis . Chemotherapeutic resistance hinders successful treatment . This resistance is often associated with mutations in codon 12 of the K-Ras gene ( K-Ras 12 ) , which is present in over 90% of all pancreatic adenocarcinomas . Codon 12 mutations maintain Ras in a constitutively active state leading to continuous cellular proliferation . Our study determined if TRAIL resistance in pancreatic adenocarcinomas with K-Ras 12 mutations could be overcome by first sensitizing the cells with Benzyl isothiocyanate ( BITC ) . BITC is a component of cruciferous vegetables and a cell cycle inhibitor . BxPC3 , MiaPaCa2 and Panc-1 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were examined for TRAIL resistance . Our studies show BITC induced TRAIL sensitization by dual activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways .
Recent studies have demonstrated that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) are able to suppress cell proliferation and inhibit tumor growth . The objective of our study was to investigate the influence of a high dose EPA on the development of the tumor phenotype in ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( Atm)-deficient mice , a genetic cancer model that is associated with increased levels of oxidative stress . We analyzed toxicity , proliferation , cell-cycle progression , and apoptosis of EPA in vitro and latency to tumorigenesis in vivo . Because of the impact of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) on the tumor incidence in ataxia telangiectasia ( AT ) , we further analyzed the effect of EPA on the generation of ROS and oxidative DNA damage ( ODD ) . EPA effectively inhibited proliferation , altered cell-cycle progression , and induced apoptosis of tumor cells ( AT-4 ) . EPA showed no effect on the latency to tumorigenesis in Atm-deficient mice . EPA treatment was accompanied by a significant increase of ROS and ODD . Our results demonstrate the antiproliferative effect of EPA on tumor cells by alteration of cell-cycle progression and induction of apoptosis in vitro . On the other hand , EPA treatment of Atm-deficient mice led to the formation of ROS and accumulation of ODD that might have abrogated the anticarcinogenic effect caused by EPA .
Medicinal mushroom Ganoderma lucidum is one of the most esteemed natural products that have been used in the traditional Chinese medicine . In this article , we demonstrate that G. lucidum triterpene extract ( GLT ) suppresses proliferation of human colon cancer cells HT-29 and inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft model of colon cancer . These effects of GLT are associated with the cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and the induction of the programmed cell death Type II-autophagy in colon cancer cells . Here , we show that GLT induces formation of autophagic vacuoles and upregulates expression of Beclin-1 ( 1.3-fold increase ) and LC-3 ( 7.3-fold increase ) proteins in colon cancer cells and in tumors in a xenograft model ( Beclin-1 , 3.9-fold increase ; LC-3 , 1.9-fold increase ) . Autophagy is mediated through the inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38 MAPK ) because p38 MAPK inhibitor , SB202190 , induces autophagy and expression of Beclin-1 ( 1.2-fold increase ) and LC-3 ( 7.4-fold increase ) , and GLT suppresses phosphorylation of p38 MAPK ( approximately 60% inhibition ) in colon cancer cells . Taken together , our data demonstrate a novel mechanism responsible for the inhibition of colon cancer cells by G. lucidum and suggest GLT as natural product for the treatment of colon cancer .
OBJECTIVES To evaluate and compare the incidence , TNM staging and the current strate- gy for the surgical treatment of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) in two European urologic institutions , situated in Varna , Bulgaria and in Bari , Italy . Both clinics have sound experience of RCC surgery , and modern laparoscopic equipment . A retrospective chart review of all patients with RCC diagnosed and treated in the last year was conducted at the two sites . MATERIALS AND METHODS In total , 88 patients ( 66 males and 22 females , mean age 58 years , range 24-81 years ) were enrolled in the study . Comparisons were made between some clinical and pathologic parameters with an established prognostic and therapeutic impact . The type of surgery perormed at both sites was analyzed as well . All these comparative studies were performed in relation to the 2008 EAU guidelines on the current management of RCC . Commercially available statistical software was used for the purpose . RESULTS The results showed no difference between the two sites regarding the RCC incidence and the patients ' age and gender . Significant differences ( p value < 0.0001 ) emerged in terms of : the median size of the tumors at surgery ( 8.5 cm in Varna , SD + 4.04 vs. 4.4 cm in Bari , SD _ 2.02 ) ; T-stage of the tumor ( Varna T T2-30% , T3-22% , T4-15% vs. Bari T1-64% , T2-12% , T3-24% , T4-0% ) ; N-positive disese ( 24% vs. 2% ) ; distant metastases ( 20% vs. 2% ) and presence of necrosis in the renal masses ( 37% vs. 19% ) . Thus , 85% of Varna patients underwent open radical nephrectomy , 11% nephron-sparing surgery and 4% explorative laparotomy , due to inoperability of the renal mass . Only 29% of Bari patients were treated by open radical nephrectomy , 12% underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy , 57% open partial nephrectomy and 2% laparoscopic partial tumor resection . Conclusions : These numbers demonstrate more advantageous tumour features at the Italian clinic in terms of organ-sparing surgical options ( open and laparoscopic ) , whereas in the Bulgarian clinic the tumour features pose certain limitations to the application of modern surgical techniques . This difference is due to early diagnosis of RCC in Italy , allowing treatment of smaller volume tumors .
OBJECTIVE To study the effect of necrostatin ( Nec-1 ) on apoptosis induced by aluminum ( Al ) , and approach the mechanism . METHODS Neural cell death model was made by 4 mmol/L Al treated neuroblastoma cells ( SH-SY5Y ) . Cell viabilities were detected at different concentrations of Al and/or Nec-1 . Hoechst 33342/PI double staining was used to observe apoptosis and ( or ) necrosis that were quantified by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI double staining . Apoptotic pathway was tested by activities of Caspase-3 , Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 . In addition , the expression of NF-kappa B and Cyt-c was measured by immunocytochemistry . RESULTS Cell viabilities were significantly decreased with the increasing concentrations of Al ( P < 0.05 ) , which could be significantly upregulated by 60 micromol/L Nec-1 ( P < 0.05 ) and were correlated with the concentrations of Nec-1 ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 ) . Apoptosis and necrosis were observed under fluorescent microscope and quantified by flow cytometry , which suggested an increasing trend of apoptotic and necrotic rates ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 ) . Whereas , Nec-1 could not only decrease the necrotic rate but also apoptotic rate as well ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 ) . Data of Nec-1 on caspases activities showed that Nec-1 could not affect Caspase-9 activity ( P > 0.05 ) and Cty-c protein expression as well ( P > 0.05 ) . However , Nec-1 could reduce Caspase-8 activity significantly ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 ) and increase NF-kappa B protein expression ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.01 ) and finally decrease Caspase-3 activity ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION Nec-1 could reduce cell apoptosis induced by Al , through Caspase-8 pathway , and up-regulate the expression of NF-kappa B protein .
Cellular senescence is a mechanism to inhibit the growth of mammalian cells after oncogenic activation , or in response to damage or stress . We describe here the identification of a novel gene , SENEX , that regulates stress induced premature senescence pathways in endothelial cells ( ECs ) involving p16(INK4a) and retinoblastoma protein activation . Endogenous levels of SENEX remain unchanged during replicative senescence but are regulated by H(2)O(2)-mediated stress . In contrast to that previously described for senescence in other cell types , the SENEX induced senescent ECs are profoundly anti-inflammatory . The cells are resistant to tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)alpha-induced apoptosis , adhesion of neutrophils and mononuclear cells , and the surface ( but not cytoplasmic ) expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 . Furthermore they are resistant to thrombin induced vascular leak . Senescent ECs such as those lining atherosclerotic lesions may therefore function to limit the inflammatory response . SENEX is also essential for EC survival since depletion either ectopically by siRNA or by high- dose H(2)O(2) treatment causes apoptosis . Together , these findings expand our understanding of the role of senescence in the vasculature and identify SENEX as a fulcrum for driving the resultant phenotype of the endothelium after activation .
A novel compound 2-arylidene-4,7-dimethyl indan-1-one synthesized was screened for anticancer effect against the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line , MCF-7 . An IC50 value of > or = 80 microM , nontoxic to the normal breast cell line HBL-100 , showed complete inhibition of the MCF-7 cells . Analysis of mechanisms showed nuclear fragmentation and DNA laddering in gel electrophoresis . GSH and GR levels were found to be reduced after the compound treatment . Cell cycle analysis using fluorescent cytometry revealed G2/M phase arrest , which indicates the compound deserves consideration for further studies against cancer .
INTRODUCTION The homeobox-containing transcription factor muscle segment homeobox 2 ( Msx2 ) plays an important role in mammary gland development . However , the clinical implications of Msx2 expression in breast cancer are unclear . The aims of this study were to investigate the potential clinical value of Msx2 as a breast cancer biomarker and to clarify its functional role in vitro . METHODS Msx2 gene expression was first examined in a well-validated breast cancer transcriptomic dataset of 295 patients . Msx2 protein expression was then evaluated by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray ( TMA ) containing 281 invasive breast tumours . Finally , to assess the functional role of Msx2 in vitro , Msx2 was ectopically expressed in a highly invasive breast tumour cell line ( MDA-MB-231 ) and an immortalised breast cell line ( MCF10a ) , and these cell lines were examined for changes in growth rate , cell death and cell signalling . RESULTS Examination of Msx2 mRNA expression in a breast cancer transcriptomic dataset demonstrated that increased levels of Msx2 were associated with good prognosis ( P = 0.011 ) . Evaluation of Msx2 protein expression on a TMA revealed that Msx2 was detectable in both tumour cell nuclei and cytoplasm . Cytoplasmic Msx2 expression was associated with low grade tumours ( P = 0.012 ) and Ki67 negativity ( P = 0.018 ) . Nuclear Msx2 correlated with low-grade tumours ( P = 0.015 ) , estrogen receptor positivity ( P = 0.038 ) , low Ki67 ( P = 0.005 ) and high cyclin D1 expression ( P = 0.037 ) . Increased cytoplasmic Msx2 expression was associated with a prolonged breast cancer-specific survival ( P = 0.049 ) , recurrence-free survival ( P = 0.029 ) and overall survival ( P = 0.019 ) . Ectopic expression of Msx2 in breast cell lines resulted in radically decreased cell viability mediated by induction of cell death via apoptosis . Further analysis of Msx2-expressing cells revealed increased levels of p21 and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) and decreased levels of Survivin and the ' split ends ' ( SPEN ) protein family member RBM15 . CONCLUSIONS We conclude that increased Msx2 expression results in improved outcome for breast cancer patients , possibly by increasing the likelihood of tumour cell death by apoptosis .
The expression of " growth arrest and DNA damage inducible genes 45 and 153 " is related to apoptotic induction of cells . GADD45 is an effector gene of the tumor suppressor p53 , and GADD153 is associated with cellular function of cancer prevention . Curcumin , isolated from the plant Curcuma longa ( LINN ) , has been investigated as a promising cancer preventive in food because curcumin , a phenolic and coloring compound , is widely ingested in the Indian subcontinent . However , the exact mechanisms of action of curcumin have not yet been clearly elucidated . Based on our successful results with green tea catechins as cancer preventive , we studied the relationship between the expression of GADD45 and 153 and apoptotic induction in human lung cancer cell line PC-9 . In our study curcumin increased the expression of GADD45 and 153 in a p53-independent manner . Curcumin also inhibited the growth of PC-9 cells and induced G(1)/S arrest of the cell-cycle followed by strong induction of apoptosis . Treatment with GADD45 and 153 small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) inhibited the apoptotic induction in PC-9 cells by curcumin . Moreover , curcumin induced the expression of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor genes p21 and p27 , while it inhibited the expression of numerous genes , including Bcl-2 , cyclin D1 , CDK2 , CDK4 and CDK6 . All the results with PC-9 cells suggest that the up-regulation of GADD45 and 153 by curcumin is a prime mechanism in the anticancer activity of curcumin .
Genipin is a metabolite of geniposide isolated from an extract of Gardenia fructus . Some observations suggested that genipin could induce cell apoptosis in hepatoma cells and PC3 human prostate cancer cells . However , the effects of genipin on HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells are still unknown . In this study , we provided evidences that genipin induced the death of HeLa cells through apoptotic pathway in a dose-dependent manner . Genipin could remarkably induce cytotoxicity in HeLa cells and inhibit its proliferation . Induction of the apoptosis by genipin was confirmed by analysis of DNA fragmentation and induction of sub-G(1) peak through flow cytometry . The results also showed that genipin-treated HeLa cells cycle was arrested at G(1) phase . Western blot analysis revealed that the phosphorylated c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase ( JNK ) protein , phospho-Jun protein , p53 protein and bax protein significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner after treatment of genipin for 24 h , and to our knowledge , the activation of JNK maybe result in the increase of the p53 protein level , and the increase of the p53 protein led to the accumulation of bax protein , bax protein further induced cell apoptotic death eventually . Taken all these together , it is possible to develop genipin as an anti-cancer drug .
INTRODUCTION HER2 and estrogen receptor ( ER ) are important in breast cancer and are therapeutic targets of trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) and tamoxifen , respectively . Retinoids inhibit breast cancer growth , and modulate signaling by HER2 and ER . We hypothesized that treatment with retinoids and simultaneous targeting of HER2 and/or ER may have enhanced anti-tumor effects . METHODS The effects of retinoids combined with trastuzumab or tamoxifen were examined in two human breast cancer cell lines in culture , BT474 and SKBR3 . Assays of proliferation , apoptosis , differentiation , cell cycle distribution , and receptor signaling were performed . RESULTS In HER2-overexpressing/ER-positive BT474 cells , combining all-trans retinoic acid ( atRA ) with tamoxifen or trastuzumab synergistically inhibited cell growth , and altered cell differentiation and cell cycle . Only atRA/trastuzumab-containing combinations induced apoptosis . BT474 and HER2-overexpressing/ER-negative SKBR3 cells were treated with a panel of retinoids ( atRA , 9-cis-retinoic acid , 13-cis-retinoic acid , or N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide ( fenretinide ) ( 4-HPR) ) combined with trastuzumab . In BT474 cells , none of the single agents except 4-HPR induced apoptosis , but again combinations of each retinoid with trastuzumab did induce apoptosis . In contrast , the single retinoid agents did cause apoptosis in SKBR3 cells ; this was only modestly enhanced by addition of trastuzumab . The retinoid drug combinations altered signaling by HER2 and ER . Retinoids were inactive in trastuzumab-resistant BT474 cells . CONCLUSIONS Combining retinoids with trastuzumab maximally inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in trastuzumab-sensitive cells . Treatment with such combinations may have benefit for breast cancer patients .
Taxol ( Paclitaxel ) is an important natural product for the treatment of solid tumors such as ovarian , breast , non-small-cell lung tumors , and some head and neck carcinomas . Different concentrations of taxol trigger distinct effects on cell death forms . In present study , cell counting kit ( CCK-8 ) assay , confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging , flow cytometry ( FCM ) and western blotting ( WB ) analysis were used to analyze the characteristics of cell death induced by low ( 35 nM ) and high ( 70 microM ) concentration of taxol respectively in human lung adenocarcinoma ( ASTC-a-1 ) cells . Our results showed that low concentration of taxol induced cell death dominantly in apoptotic fashion associated with nuclear fragmentation , protein synthesis , phosphatidylserine ( PS ) externalization , G2/M cell cycle arrest , Bax translocation into mitochondria and caspase-3 activation , whereas high concentration of this drug induced significant cytoplasm vacuolization , mitochondria swelling and paraptosis-like cell death form without protein synthesis that is necessary for paraptosis . Although the mechanism of high concentration of taxol-induced paraptosis-like cell death has not been clear , this finding might have a potential implication for cancer therapy , especially for apoptosis-resistant cancer .
BACKGROUND Current treatments have a modest impact on survival of pancreatic cancer patients and this study investigates the interaction between sorafenib and gemcitabine and the molecular pharmacodynamics of this combination . METHODS The pancreatic cancer cells were treated with sorafenib and gemcitabine , alone or in combination . The effects of treatments were evaluated on cell proliferation , cell cycle , apoptosis , phosphorylation of Akt , c-Kit , ERK and VEGFR2 , and expression of genes related to drug activity . RESULTS Gemcitabine and sorafenib synergistically interacted on the inhibition of cell proliferation , and assessment of apoptosis demonstrated that drug associations increased the apoptotic index . Sorafenib reduced c-Kit , ERK and VEGFR2 activation and on the other hand , gemcitabine inhibited Akt phosphorylation . Moreover , quantitative PCR showed that sorafenib modulated the expression of genes related to gemcitabine activity , while gemcitabine induced the expression of RKIP . CONCLUSION These data demonstrate that gemcitabine and sorafenib combination displays a synergistic effect in pancreatic cancer cells .
Evidence suggests that stem-like cells are responsible for initiation , maintenance and recurrence of solid tumors , including Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM ) . GBM is an intractable , highly lethal tumor of the central nervous system . Although epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is highly expressed in many GBMs , anti-EGFR therapies have been unsuccessful as treatment . Few studies have examined EGFR activation in GBM stem cells ( GSCs ) to determine if patient-specific GSCs are amenable to anti-EGFR therapy pre-clinically . We hypothesized that EGFR activation in GSCs varied between patients and was an important determinant of responsiveness to anti-EGFR therapy . Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis was performed on tumor-spheres by immuncytochemistry in the presence and absence of the AG1478 . Second messenger pathways operative in these processes were elucidated by immunoblotting . EGFR activated AKT and inactivated GSK3beta in EGFR+/PTEN+ GSCs . AG1478 and erlotinib significantly decreased the total number of tumor-spheres that EGFR+/ PTEN+ GSCs generated and the rate of sphere formation . Inhibition of EGFR signaling by AG1478 increased GSC senescence and apoptosis , likely via inhibition of AKT and activation of GSK3beta . Sphere formation by EGFR-/ PTEN- GSCs was independent of EGF stimulation , but dependant on B27 growth supplement . Our data suggest that EGFR+/PTEN+ GSCs are susceptible to anti-EGFR therapy in vitro .
In spite of numerous advances , the 5-year survival rate for head and neck squamous cell cancer has remained largely stagnant and few new anti-tumor drugs have been developed . PCH4 , a derivative of n-butylidenephthalide , has been investigated for its anti-tumor effects on oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) . The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-tumor mechanism of a potential target gene , Nur77 , in OSCC cells , which can be induced by PCH4 treatment . Data show that PCH4 promoted Nur77 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and induced cell apoptosis in OSCC cells . When Nur77 translocation was blocked , the degree of tumor apoptosis caused by PCH4 was significantly inhibited ( p < 0.05 ) . Within the MAPK pathway , PCH4 only induced JNK phosphorylation . Furthermore , treatment with a JNK inhibitor significantly reduced PCH4-induced apoptosis ( p < 0.05 ) and decreased PCH4-induced Nur77 expression ( p < 0.05 ) . In a xenograft animal model , administration of PCH4 also showed anti-tumor effects . We have demonstrated that OSCC cells are sensitive to PCH4 and that Nur77 protein translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm might be associated with the induction of apoptosis by PCH4 . These results indicate that PCH4 may serve as a potential anti-tumor drug for OSCC therapy .
A 51-year-old previously healthy man , an ex-smoker , was admitted to the authors ' medical department with a 3-month history of dry cough ; intermittent fever ; painless , ulcerated cutaneous lesions over the trunk and limbs ( Figure 1 ) ; and progressive weight loss . He was of Greek descent . His medical history was remarkable for nasal polyps , which were surgically removed 15 years earlier . Initially , he had been treated with antibiotics , without improvement . Several days before admission , chest radiography revealed pulmonary infiltrates in the left lower lobe . On admission , physical examination revealed a well-orientated man in mild distress , with inspiratory rhonchi at the lower part of the left lung and scattered erythematous nodules of variable size , some of which were ulcerated . Laboratory values were notable for leukopenia , 3.3 x 10(9)/L ; total protein , 5.9 g/dL ; globulin , 2.2 g/dL ; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase , 86 IU/L ; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase , 71 IU/L ; and lactate dehydrogenase , 519 U/L . Computed tomograph ( CT ) of the chest showed multiple alveolar opacities bilaterally ( Figure 2 ) . Fiberoptic bronchoscopy did not reveal any important pathologic findings . Results of bronchial biopsy , cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage , washing , brushing , and sputum following bronchoscopy were negative . CT of the brai and sinonasal area revealed an abnormal low-density mass in the left nasal area . CT findings of the abdomen were negative , as were results of a bone marrow biopsy . There was no evidence of immunosuppression . The differential diagnosis , considering the evidence described , included granulomatous or infectious diseases , angiocentric lymphoproliferative lesions , and lymphomas . Biopsy of a skin lesion showed lymphoproliferative infiltration of the dermis with a follicular and angiocentric growth pattern and regional epidermal necrosis . Immunohistochemical stains showed that the tumor cell were positive for CD56 and CD3 ( cytoplasmic positivity ) and expressed the cytotoxic proteins T-cell intracellular antigen and granzyme B ( Figure 3 ) They lacked TdT , CD34 , CD7 , CD8 , TCL-1 , and CD123 . Findings from an in situ hybridization study for Epstein-Barr virus were negative . Give this result , molecular analysis ofT-cell receptor ( TCR ) gene rearrangements was performed using polymerase chain reaction-based TCR-gamma gene , wit negative results . The morphology and the immunophenotype were consistent with natural killer/T-cell lymphoma , nasal-type . Nasal involvement must be first excluded to proceed to the diagnosis of nasal-type natural killer-cell lymphoma . Indeed , histologic examination of the nasal mass revealed its polypoid nature . Thus , the authors were led to the diagnosis of extranodal extranasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma , nasal-type , CD56-positive , Ep stein-Barr virus-negative , TCR-negative . The patient received combination chemotherapy and completed 4 cycles of cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin vincristine , and prednisone every 14 days for 2 months . Skin lesions improved , and there was no fever soon after the initiation of therapy . Reevaluatio after the fourth cycle , however , disclosed pulmonary infiltrations as well as leukemic infiltration of the central nervous system . The patient had receive systemic salvage chemotherapy and intrathecal infusions of methotrexate . Although the lung lesions had diminished at that time , the patient develope paraplegia , his clinical course rapidly deteriorated , and he eventually died .
INTRODUCTION IkappaB Kinase epsilon ( IKKepsilon ) is a member of the IKK family which plays an important role in the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) . Overexpressed in over 30% of breast cancers , IKKepsilon has been recently identified as a potential breast cancer oncogene . The purpose of this study is to examine the therapeutic potential of IKKepsilon siRNA on human breast cancer cells . METHODS Eight siRNAs targeting different regions of the IKKepsilon mRNA were designed , and the silencing effect was screened by quantitative real time RT-PCR . The biological effects of synthetic siRNAs on human breast cancer cells were investigated by examining the cell proliferation , migration , invasion , focus formation , anchorage-independent growth(via soft agar assay ) , cell cycle arrest , apoptosis ( via annexing binding ) , NF-kappaB basal level , and NF-kappaB related gene expressions upon the IKKepsilon silencing . RESULTS Silencing of IKKepsilon in human breast cancer cells resulted in decrease of focus formation potential and clonogenicity as well as in vitro cell migration/invasion capabilities . Moreover , knockdown of IKKepsilon suppressed cell proliferation . Cell cycle assay showed that the anti-proliferation effect of IKKepsilon siRNA was mediated by arresting cells in G(0)/G(1) phase , which was caused by down-regulation of cyclin D(1) . Furthermore , we demonstrated that silencing of IKKepsilon inhibited the NF-kappaB basal activity as well as the Bcl-2 expression . Significant apoptosis was not observed in breast cancer cells upon the silencing of IKKepsilon . The present study provided the first evidence that silencing IKKepsilon using synthetic siRNA could inhibit the invasiveness properties and proliferation of breast cancer cells . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggested that silencing IKKepsilon using synthetic siRNA may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for breast cancer .
Myxoid leiomyosarcoma is an extremely rare variant of leiomyosarcoma , masquerading almost to perfection as a benign lesion . For , indeed , the tumor lacks the defining features of high mitotic activity , cellular atypia or necrosis , and the microscopic picture is dominated by abundant myxoid stroma containing sparse spindle cells . We report here such a case occurring in the uterus and discuss the differential diagnosis . The relevant literature is reviewed .
Spindle cell oncocytoma ( SCO ) of the pituitary gland is a relatively recently established , very rare subtype of adenohypophysis tumours that was introduced as a distinct clinicopathological entity in the fourth edition of WHO classification of the central nervous system tumours ( 2007 ) . It is non-endocrine neoplasm of the anterior pituitary that occurs in adults and usually follows a benign clinical course , corresponding to WHO grade I. Up to now , pituitary SCO have been reported occasionally and only 14 cases of SCO have been documented in the literature . Because of their rarity , the pathogenesis and natural history of these tumours have not been fully characterized . We report two additional cases of SCO occurring in females aged 63 years ( Case 1 ) and 65 years ( Case 2 ) , who presented with pan-hypopituitarism , headache and visual field defect . In both cases , the magnetic resonance imaging showed solid sellar mass of moderate size with suprasellar extension . The clinical and radiological features suggested non-functioning pituitary macroadenomas without evidence of invasive growth . One patient presented with tumour recurrence 3 years after undergoing the previous surgical removal of tumour , which was initially misdiagnosed as schwannoma . The first tumour was removed by transsphenoidal surgery and the second one by frontal craniotomy . Histologically and immunohistochemically , both tumours displayed the features typical for SCO of the pituitary . They were composed of interwoven fascicles of spindle cells exhibiting abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm of oncocytic or granular appearance . Mitoses were rarely observed and necrosis was absent . In one case , the advanced lymphocytic infliltration was observed within neoplastic tissue . The tumour cells exhibited immunoreactivity for S-100 protein , galectin-3 , vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen but they were negative for GFAP , anterior pituitary neuroendocrine markers ( prolactin , growth hormone , TSH , ACTH , FSH , LH ) , chromogranin , synaptophysin , cytokeratin CK ( AE1/AE3 ) , smooth muscle actin , desmin , CD34 and CD68 . MIB1 labeling index did not exceed 10% . Ultrastructurally , the tumour cells were rich in mitochondria with lamellar cristae . Moreover , in Case 2 some tumour cells showed a number of giant mitochondria with severely destructed internal matrix . Spindle cell oncocytoma of the anterior pituitary is often misdiagnosed entity of uncertain histogenesis . It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of various sellar-region lesions of oncocytic morphology .
Autophagy is one of the survival processes of cancer cells , especially in stressful conditions such as starvation , hypoxia and chemotherapeutic agents . However , its roles in tumor survival have not yet been fully elucidated . Here , we found for the first time that JAK2/STAT3 was activated in HeLa cells when they were starved or treated with rapamycin . STAT3 activation was associated with autophagic processes , because it was completely inhibited by 3-methyladenine , partially inhibited by knockdown of molecules associated with autophagic processes and blocked by antioxidants , DPI , a Nox inhibitor and knockdown of p22 phox , indicating that ROS generated by Nox that was activated during autophagic processes activated JAK2/STAT3 pathway . Activated STAT3 directly bound to IL6 promoter and increased IL6 mRNA and protein secretion . Finally , the conditioned media , which included IL6 , from starved HeLa cells promoted cancer cell survival in both normal and starved conditions , confirmed by clonogenic , proliferation and cell death assays . These data together indicate that the autophagic process in cancer cells can contribute to their survival by JAk2/STAT3 activation and subsequent secretion of growth factors .
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of high-resolution MRI ( HR-MRI ) and proton MR spectroscopy ( (1)H-MRS ) for monitoring the early therapeutic response to radiotherapy . Twenty rabbits with VX2 carcinoma were divided into control ( n = 8 ) and irradiation ( n = 12 ) groups . The irradiation group underwent HR-MRI and ( 1)H-MRS using a microscopy coil at 1 , 3 , 7 or 14 days after irradiation . Rabbits in the control group were subjected to HR-MRI and ( 1)H-MRS at the same time intervals . All rabbits were killed after imaging and subjected to histopathologic examinations . The diameter of necrosis by HR-MRI was then compared to that on the gross specimens . The ratios of choline/creatine ( Cho/Cr ) and lactate/creatine ( Lac/Cr ) on the tumor and necrotic area detected by in vivo ( 1)H-MRS were compared between the control and irradiation groups , respectively . In addition , the ratios of Cho/Cr and Lac/Cr were compared between the tumor and necrotic area in each irradiation group . A significant correlation was found between the diameter of necrosis in each sequence of HR-MRI and that in the gross specimens ( r = 0.84-0.91 , p = 0.03- < 0.003 ) . The ratios of Lac/Cr in the tumors of the irradiation groups were significantly higher than those in the control groups after 1 day and 3 days of irradiation ( p = 0.04 , and p = 0.02 ) . Histological analysis showed necrosis and swelling of the endothelia of capillaries and arterioles at 1 day and 3 days after irradiation . It was suggested that HR-MRI and ( 1)H-MRS are useful methods for monitoring the early therapeutic response to radiotherapy .
BACKGROUND Apoptosis , a widely important mechanism that contributes to cell growth reduction , is reported to be induced by Crocus sativus in different cancer types . The present study was designed to elucidate apoptosis induction by crocin , a main component of Crocus sativus in a human pancreatic cancer cell line ( BxPC-3 ) . METHODS Cell viability was measured by MTT assay , Hoechest33258 staining was used to detect the chromatin condensation characteristic of apoptosis , and DNA fragmentation was assessed by gel electrophoresis and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry . RESULTS Crocin induced apoptosis and G1-phase cell cycle arrest of BxPC-3 cells , while decreasing cell viability in a dose dependent and time dependent manner . Cells treated with 10mug/L crocin exhibited apoptotic morphology ( brightly blue-fluorescent condensed nuclei on Hoechst 33258 staining ) and reduction of volume . DNA analysis revealed typical ladders as early as 12 hours after treatment indicative of apoptosis . CONCLUSION Our preclinical study demonstrated a pancreatic cancer cell line to be highly sensitive to crocin-mediated growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death . Although the molecular mechanisms of crocin action are not yet clearly understood , it appears to have potential as a therapeutic agent .
Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinomas of the kidney are rare neoplasms constituting about 1-5% of all renal malignant neoplasms . These are aggressive tumors and are commonly associated with conventional ( clear cell ) renal cell carcinomas , but cases associated with chromophobe renal cell carcinomas are sparse . Cytological features of such lesions have rarely been reported . Here , we report a unique case of a 48-year-old male patient who presented with right flank lump and pain . A fine needle aspiration was performed from the lesion under ultrasound guidance and a cytological diagnosis of pleomorphic sarcoma was made . A right-sided radical nephrectomy was carried out and subsequent histopathology revealed a sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma with wide areas of necrosis coexisting with chromophobe renal cell carcinoma with calcification . Differentiation of pleomorphic sarcoma from a sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma is , thus , challenging from cytopathology smears and the differential diagnoses should always be borne in mind while giving a cytopathological opinion .
BACKGROUND AND AIMS breast reconstruction with silicone prosthesis following nipple-sparing mastectomy has become widely accepted as a reconstruction option in women requiring mastectomy for cancer . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and some factors influencing early local complications in patients undergoing NSM with immediate implant reconstruction . MATERIAL AND METHODS prospective study was performed on a consecutive series of 214 breast reconstructions in 205 patients . All complications during the six weeks after surgery were recorded. 42 prostheses were implanted after neoadjuvant chemotherapy , 27 patients previously had radiotherapy due to breast conserving surgery and in all other cases surgery was the pri-mary treatment for cancer . RESULTS the overall six-week complication rate was 16% ( 35 ) and included : major skin flap necrosis ( 4% , 9 procedures ) , minor skin necrosis ( 3% , 7 ) , major infection ( 2% , 5 ) , minor infection ( 3% , 7 ) , prolonged seroma formation ( 3% , 6 ) , haematoma ( 1% , 2 ) and epidermolysis ( 1% , 2 ) . In 6% ( 12 ) reconstruction procedures explantation of prosthesis was done . Neoadjuvant chemo-therapy and radiotherapy were not associated with higher rate of complications . CONCLUSION nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction has acceptable morbidity rate in the hand of experienced oncoplastic surgeon and therefore should be considered as treatment option to women requiring mastectomy .
Over the past two decades , bioactive natural compounds have been shown to be a plausible adjunct to the treatment of breast cancer , the second leading cause of cancer death among American women . This study was designed to investigate the effects of ursolic acid ( UA ) , a pentacyclic triterpene found in many foods and herbs , in a model of postmenopausal breast cancer . Ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice ( n = 40 ) were randomized to receive control diet ( AIN-93G ) or diet supplemented with UA at 1 of 3 doses ( wt/wt ) : 0.05% , 0.10% , or 0.25% ( =~54 , 106 , or 266 mg/kg body weight/day , respectively ) . After 3 wk , syngeneic MMTV-Wnt-1 mammary tumor cells were injected in the mammary fat pad , and mice continued on their respective diets for 5 more wk . All UA doses decreased tumor cell proliferation , as assessed by Ki67 immunostaining ; nevertheless , UA at 0.10% was most effective in inhibiting tumor take and decreasing tumor final tumor size . Modulation of Akt/mTOR signaling and induction of apoptosis appeared to mediate these effects on tumor growth . UA potently disrupted cell cycle progression and induced necrosis in a clonal MMTV-Wnt-1 mammary tumor cell line in vitro . This study supports the potential of UA as an antitumorigenic agent .
Periplocin is one of cardenolides isolated from cortex periplocae which is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and reinforcement of bones and tendons in traditional medicine . Here , we investigated the anti-tumor activity of periplocin against lung cancer cells bothin vitro and in vivo , and explored its anti-cancer mechanism . Periplocin inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells and induced their apoptosis in time- and dose-dependent manners by cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase . Periplocin exhibited anti-tumor activity both in human ( A549 ) and mouse ( LL/2 ) lung cancer xenograft models . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that intratumoral angiogenesis was significantly suppressed . Furthermore , anti-cancer activity mediated by periplocin was associated with decreased level of phosphorylated AKT and ERK both in vitro and in vivo , which were important for cell growth and survival . Moreover , periplocin induced apoptosis by downregulating Bcl-2 and upregulating Bax , leading to activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 . These findings suggested that periplocin could inhibit the growth of lung cancer both in vitro and in vivo , which could be attributed to the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis signaling pathway , such as AKT and ERK . These observations provide further evidence on the anti-tumor effect of periplocin , and it may be of importance to further explore its potential role as a therapeutic agent for cancer .
Deregulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) is closely associated with malignant transformation and tumor cell survival in various cancers . We found that IGF-1R expression level in leukemia cells positively correlated with the percentage of blast in bone marrow from de novo acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patients . Moreover , we showed that NVP-ADW742 , a novel small weight molecular inhibitor of IGF-IR , could induce apoptosis in both HL-60 cell line and primary AML blasts . However , no significant alteration of cell cycle was observed in HL-60 cells . Further studies revealed that NVP-ADW742 induced Akt dephosphorylation , which might subsequently induce p38 phosphorylation and decrease antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression in HL-60 cells . Finally , we demonstrated that NVP-ADW742 could synergize with Ara-C to induce the kill in a subset of drug-resistant AML specimens . We suggested that IGF-lR targeting might be therapeutically beneficial for some AML patients .
NK1 is a tachykinin receptor highly relevant to tumorigenesis and metastasis development in breast cancer and other carcinomas . Despite the substantial efforts done to develop potent NK1 receptor antagonists , none of these antagonists had shown good antitumor activity in clinical trials . Now , we have tested the effect of inhibition of the neuropeptide Substance P ( SP ) , a NK1 ligand , as a potential therapeutic approach in cancer . We found that the inhibition of SP with antibodies strongly inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in breast , colon , and prostate cancer cell lines . These effects were accompained by a decrease in the mitogen-activated kinase singaling pathway . Interestingly , in some cell lines SP abrogation decreased the steady state of Her2 and EGFR , suggesting that SP-mediated signaling is important for the basal activity of these ErbB receptors . In consequence , we observed a blockade of the cell cycle progression and the inhibition of several cell cycle-related proteins including mTOR . SP inhibition also induced cell death in cell lines resistant to Lapatinib and Trastuzumab that have increased levels of active Her2 , suggesting that this therapeutic approach could be also effective for those cancers resistant to current anti-ErbB therapies . Thus , we propose a new therapeutic strategy for those cancers that express NK1 receptor and/or other tachykinin receptors , based in the immuno-blockade of the neuropeptide SP .
The androgen receptor ( AR ) plays a central role in prostate cancer progression to the castration-resistant ( CR ) lethal state . L-Dopa decarboxylase ( DDC ) is an AR coactivator that increases in expression with disease progression and is coexpressed with the receptor in prostate adenocarcinoma cells , where it may enhance AR activity . Here , we hypothesize that the DDC enzymatic inhibitor , carbidopa , can suppress DDC-coactivation of AR and retard prostate tumor growth . Treating LNCaP prostate cancer cells with carbidopa in transcriptional assays suppressed the enhanced AR transactivation seen with DDC overexpression and decreased prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) mRNA levels . Carbidopa dose-dependently inhibited cell growth and decreased survival in LNCaP cell proliferation and apoptosis assays . The inhibitory effect of carbidopa on DDC-coactivation of AR and cell growth/survival was also observed in PC3 prostate cancer cells ( stably expressing AR ) . In vivo studies demonstrated that serum PSA velocity and tumor growth rates elevated ~2-fold in LNCaP xenografts , inducibly overexpressing DDC , were reverted to control levels with carbidopa administration . In castrated mice , treating LNCaP tumors , expressing endogenous DDC , with carbidopa delayed progression to the CR state from 6 to 10 weeks , while serum PSA and tumor growth decreased 4.3-fold and 5.4-fold , respectively . Our study is a first time demonstration that carbidopa can abrogate DDC-coactivation of AR in prostate cancer cells and tumors , decrease serum PSA , reduce tumor growth and delay CR progression . Since carbidopa is clinically approved , it may be readily used as a novel therapeutic strategy to suppress aberrant AR activity and delay prostate cancer progression .
Ruthenium(II) methylimidazole complexes , with the general formula [ Ru(MeIm)(4)(NN)](2+) ( NN=tip ( RMC1 ) , iip ( RMC2 ) , dppz ( RMC3 ) , dpq ( RMC4 ) ; MeIm=1-methylimidazole , tip=2-(thiophene-2-yl)-1H-imidazo [ 4,5-f ] [ 1,10]phenanthroline , iip=2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)-1H-imidazo [ 4,5-f ] [ 1,10]phenanthroline , dppz=dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine , dpq=pyrazino [ 2,3-f ] [ 1,10]phenanthroline ) , were synthesized and characterized . As determined by MTT ( 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ) assay , these complexes displayed potent anti-proliferation activity against various cancer cells . RMC1 inhibited the growth of A549 ( human lung adenocarcinoma ) lung cells through induction of apoptotic cell death , as evidenced by the accumulation of cell population in sub-G1 phase . RMC1 also induced the depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential in A549 cells by regulating the expression of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members . Another experiment showed that Bid protein was also activated by RMC1 , which implied that RMC1 could existed two pathways crosstalk , namely , have exogenous death receptor signaling pathway . These results demonstrated that RMC1 induced cancer cell death by acting on both mitochondrial and death receptor apoptotic pathways , suggesting that RMC1 could be a candidate for further evaluation as a chemotherapeutic agent against human cancers .
The type I insulin-like growth factor receptor ( IGF1R ) contributes to cancer cell biology . Disruption of IGF1R signaling alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents has emerged as a new therapeutic strategy . Our laboratory has shown that sequential treatment with doxorubicin ( DOX ) and anti-IGF1R antibodies significantly enhanced the response to chemotherapy . In this study , we examined whether inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of this receptor family would also enhance chemotherapy response . Cis-3-[3-(4-methyl-piperazin-l-yl)-cyclobutyl]-1-(2-phenyl-quinolin-7-yl)-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazin-8-ylamine ( PQIP ) inhibited IGF1R and insulin receptor ( InsR ) kinase activity and downstream activation of ERK1/2 and Akt in MCF-7 and LCC6 cancer cells . PQIP inhibited both monolayer growth and anchorage-independent growth in a dose-dependent manner . PQIP did not induce apoptosis , but rather , PQIP treatment was associated with an increase in autophagy . We examined whether sequential or combination therapy of PQIP with DOX could enhance growth inhibition . PQIP treatment together with DOX or DOX followed by PQIP significantly inhibited anchorage-independent growth in MCF-7 and LCC6 cells compared to single agent alone . In contrast , pre-treatment with PQIP followed by DOX did not enhance the cytotoxicity of DOX in vitro . Furthermore , OSI-906 , a PQIP derivative , inhibited IGF-I signaling in LCC6 xenograft tumors in vivo . When given once a week , simultaneous administration of OSI-906 and DOX significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of DOX . In summary , these results suggest that timing and duration of the IGF1R/InsR tyrosine kinase inhibitors with chemotherapeutic agents should be evaluated in clinical trials . Long-term disruption of IGF1R/InsR may not be necessary when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy .
We recently isolated an exon-4-deleted epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) variant , termed de4 EGFR . Because the extracellular domain alteration of receptors often influences the antitumor effect of therapeutic antibodies , it is essential to test the sensitivity of de4 EGFR(+) tumors to anti-EGFR antibodies . Therefore , in this study , the antitumor activities of mAb CH12 , an anti-EGFRvIII antibody developed in our laboratory , as well as a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-EGFR antibody , cetuximab ( C225 ) , were characterized on de4 EGFR(+) models . The results of FACS assays showed that CH12 bound to de4 EGFR with a higher avidity than did C225 . Interestingly , CH12 , but not C225 , significantly inhibited the metastasis and growth of U87MG-de4 EGFR xenografts , with a growth-inhibition ratio of 46.48% in vivo , and prolonged the survival of the tumor-bearing mice by 37.2% . Treatment with CH12 significantly suppressed tumor proliferation and angiogenesis with increased tumor apoptosis . Mechanistically , de4 EGFR protein expression was virtually undetectable in the U87MG-de4 EGFR xenografts treated with CH12 . This may account for the observed reduction of Akt and Erk phosphorylation , cyclin D1 , Bcl-2 , and Bcl-x(L) expression and the increase of p27 and E-cadherin expression . Intriguingly , LAMP-1 , a major component of the lysosome , was significantly up-regulated in the CH12-treated group but not in the C225-treated group , suggesting its contribution to the degradation of de4 EGFR . Taken together , our data demonstrated that mAb CH12 is a promising therapeutic agent for treating de4 EGFR(+) gliomas .
BACKGROUND As a highly conserved system , the activation of the Notch pathway has been implicated in the tumorigenesis of various hematologic diseases , including leukemias , lymphomas , and multiple myeloma . The Notch3 receptor is frequently expressed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) . METHODS To explore its possibility as a therapeutic target for T-ALL , we investigated the effect of Notch3 silencing on Jurkat and SupT1 cells using a novel tumor-specific short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) driven by survivin promoters . RESULTS We found that downregulated expression of Notch3 correlated with significant apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation . CONCLUSION These facts suggest that downregulating expression of Notch3 could attenuate the Notch signaling activity in T-ALL . All these results indicate that inhibition of Notch3 expression can result in potent antitumor activity in T-ALL .
Insulin-like growth factor ( IGF)-I receptor ( IGF-IR ) signaling is required for carcinogenicity and progression of several cancers but the function of this pathway and its utility as a therapeutic target have not been studied comprehensively in biliary tract carcinomas ( BTC ) . We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of elements of the IGF axis , matrilysin , overexpression of p53 and the methylation status of the IGFBP-3 promoter in 80 surgically resected BTC . We also assessed the effect of IGF-IR blockade on signal transduction , proliferation and survival in three BTC cell lines using a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor , BMS-536924 , and dominant negative IGF-IR ( IGF-IR/dn ) . The effects of IGF-IR blockade was also studied in nude mouse xenograft models . IGF-I was expressed in 60% and IGF-II in 50% of tumors . High expression was associated with tumor size . IGF-IR was expressed in 69% of the cases and was associated with advanced stage and matrilysin expression . Hypermethylation of the IGFBP-3 promoter was detected in 41% of BTC and was inversely correlated with p53 expression . BMS-536924 blocked autophosphorylation of IGF-IR and both Akt and ERK activation by both IGF-I and insulin . BMS-536924 suppressed proliferation and tumorigenicity in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion . This inhibitor upregulated chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion . Moreover , IGF-IR blockade was effective against tumors in mice . IGF-IR might identify a subset of BTC with a particularly aggressive phenotype and is a candidate therapeutic target in this disease . BMS-536924 might have significant therapeutic utility .
Pancreatic cancer remains the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States . Potent therapeutic strategies are urgently needed for pancreatic cancer . Cucurmosin is a novel type1 ribosome-inactivating protein ( RIP ) isolated from the sarcocarp of Cucurbita moschata ( pumpkin ) . Due to its cytotoxicity , cucurmosin can inhibit tumor cell proliferation through induction of apoptosis on tumor cells , but the specific mechanism is still unclear . We explored the function of cucurmosin in BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells using multiple cellular and molecular approaches such as 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay , flow cytometry , reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , Western blotting and transmission electron microscopy for observing typical changes and formation of apoptotic bodies . We found that cucurmosin inhibited the proliferation of BxPC-3 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner , and increased the cell population in the G0-G1 phase . With increasing concentration of cucurmosin , the expression of EGFR , p-PI3K , Akt , p-Akt , mTOR , p-mTOR , P70S6K-alpha , p-P70S6K-alpha , 4E-BP1 and p-4E-BP1 at the protein level was decreased , whereas the expression of p-Bad and caspase-9 was elevated . However , the mRNA expression of EGFR did not change . These findings suggest that cucurmosin can down-regulate the expression of EGFR by targeting . Cucurmosin induces the apoptosis of BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway .
The aim of the present study was to investigate the apoptosis of human ovarian cancer cell lines , A2780 and CP70 , induced by a novel curcumin analogue , B19 . The proliferation of cells was detected with methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT ) assay and apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry . Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) were assessed by the fluorescent indicator DCF-DA . The protein expression of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress pathways , GRP78 , XBP-1 , ATF-4 and CHOP , was examined with Western blotting . A growth inhibitory effect was observed after treatment with B19 in a dose-dependent manner and with more potential than curcumin . At 20 <FFFD>M , B19 induced significant apoptosis in CP70 cells . Furthermore , B19 induced the ER stress response , while curcumin had no effect on ER stress . These results suggest that B19 has more effective antitumor properties than curcumin , and is associated with the activation of ER stress and ROS in ovarian cancer cells .
A distinct group of breast cancers , called " basal " or " triple-negative " ( TN ) cancers express both basal cytokeratins and the epidermal growth factor receptor , but fail to express estrogen receptors , progesterone receptors or HER2 and have stem-like or mesenchymal features . They are particularly aggressive , are frequently chemo-resistant , with p53 mutation , up-regulation of IL-6 and Stat3 . Because TN cells are particularly sensitive to the anti-diabetic agent metformin , we hypothesized that it may target JAK2/Stat3 signaling . The effects of metformin upon Stat3 expression and activation were examined in four human TN cell lines . Metformin's effects were also studied in sublines with forced over-expression of constitutively active ( CA ) Stat3 , as well as lines with stable knockdown of Stat3 . Metformin inhibited Stat3 activation ( P-Stat3 ) at Tyr705 and Ser727 and downstream signaling in each of the four parental cell lines . CA-Stat3 transfection attenuated , whereas Stat3 knockdown enhanced , the effects of metformin upon growth inhibition and apoptosis induction . A Stat3 specific inhibitor acted synergistically with metformin in reducing cell growth and inducing apoptosis . An mTOR inhibitor showed no significant interaction with metformin . In summary , Stat3 is a critical regulator of metformin action in TN cancer cells , providing the potential for enhancing metformin's efficacy in the clinical setting .
Transcriptional coactivator amplified in breast cancer 1 ( AIB1 ) plays important roles in the progression of several cancers such as prostate cancer , breast cancer , and hepatocellular carcinoma . However , its role in cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) , a chemoresistant bile duct carcinoma with a poor prognosis , remains unclear . In this study we found that AIB1 protein was frequently overexpressed in human CCA specimens and CCA cell lines . Down-regulation of AIB1 induced the G2/M arrest and decreased the expression of mitosis-promoting factors including Cyclin A , Cyclin B , and Cdk1 through suppressing the Akt pathway , which resulted in inhibiting CCA cell proliferation . In addition , AIB1 enhanced the chemoresistance of CCA cells at least in part through up-regulating the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 . AIB1 regulated the expression of Bcl-2 in CCA cells through activating the Akt pathway as well as suppressing intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . AIB1 suppressed ROS by up-regulating antioxidants such as glutathione synthetase and glutathione peroxidase , which are targets of the NF-E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) , a critical transcription factor that regulates antioxidants , detoxification enzymes , and drug efflux proteins . AIB1 also increased the expression of another two Nrf2 targets , ABCC2 and ABCG2 , to enhance drug efflux . AIB1 served as an essential coactivator for Nrf2 activation by physically interacting with Nrf2 to enhance its transcriptional activity . Conclusion : AIB1 plays an important role in proliferation and chemoresistance of CCA through simultaneous activation of Akt and Nrf2 pathways , suggesting that AIB1 is a potential molecular target for CCA treatment .
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women , and many breast cancer patients fail conventional treatment strategies of chemotherapy , radiation , and antiestrogen therapy . Research into the molecular pathways and biomarkers involved in the development of breast cancer should yield information that will guide therapeutic decisions . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) are involved in the carcinogenesis of breast cancer and exist tight crosstalk with estrogen receptor ( ER ) pathway . Combination of EGFR and COX-2 inhibitors , therefore , could be an effective strategy for reducing cell growth in estrogen-dependent breast cancer . In order to verify the effects of EGFR and COX-2 inhibitors , breast cancer cells MCF-7 and SKBR-3 were characterized for receptors status and then treated with respective inhibitors ( nimotuzumab and celecoxib ) alone and in combination . Both cell lines were sensitive to celecoxib , but not to nimotuzumab . However , combination of two drugs demonstrated synergistic effects on cell killing . Moreover , association of two drugs resulted in SKBR-3 cells , a further G0/G1 phase arrest than one drug alone . Downregulation of p-EGFR , p-Akt , p-mTOR , and amplified in breast cancer 1 ( AIB1 ) were observed in both cell lines , and upregulation of E-cadherin was only found in MCF-7 , after treatment with single agent or in combination . These studies suggest that nimotuzumab and celecoxib exert synergistic antiproliferation effects in breast cancer , which partly correlates with ER status . Due to Akt/mTOR , EMT and AIB1 pathways participate in this process , therefore , E-cadherin and AIB1 may be considered as possible biomarkers to predict response in ER-positive breast cancer cells treated with EGFR and COX-2 inhibitors .
BACKGROUND Luteolin is a 3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone found in various fruits and vegetables . We have shown previously that luteolin reduces HT-29 cell growth by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest . The objective of this study was to examine whether luteolin downregulates the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor ( IGF-IR ) signaling pathway in HT-29 cells . METHODS In order to assess the effects of luteolin and/or IGF-I on the IGF-IR signaling pathway , cells were cultured with or without 60 mumol/L luteolin and/or 10 nmol/L IGF-I . Cell proliferation , DNA synthesis , and IGF-IR mRNA levels were evaluated by a cell viability assay , [ 3H]thymidine incorporation assays , and real-time polymerase chain reaction , respectively . Western blot analyses , immunoprecipitation , and in vitro kinase assays were conducted to evaluate the secretion of IGF-II , the protein expression and activation of IGF-IR , and the association of the p85 subunit of phophatidylinositol-3 kinase ( PI3K ) with IGF-IR , the phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK)1/2 , and cell division cycle 25c ( CDC25c ) , and PI3K activity . RESULTS Luteolin ( 0 - 60 mumol/L ) dose-dependently reduced the IGF-II secretion of HT-29 cells . IGF-I stimulated HT-29 cell growth but did not abrogate luteolin-induced growth inhibition . Luteolin reduced the levels of the IGF-IR precursor protein and IGF-IR transcripts . Luteolin reduced the IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-IR and the association of p85 with IGF-IR . Additionally , luteolin inhibited the activity of PI3K activity as well as the phosphorylation of Akt , ERK1/2 , and CDC25c in the presence and absence of IGF-I stimulation . CONCLUSIONS The present results demonstrate that luteolin downregulates the activation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways via a reduction in IGF-IR signaling in HT-29 cells ; this may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the observed luteolin-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest .
Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) amplification occurs in over 30% of esophageal carcinomas . Combination therapies with EGFR and HER2-targeting agents and cytotoxic agents are considered a potential therapeutic option for esophageal cancer . We evaluated the antitumor effects of lapatinib , a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor which simultaneously inhibits EGFR and HER2 , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-Fu ) alone and in combination on esophageal cancer cells . The antiproliferative activity of lapatinib , 5-Fu and lapatinib plus 5-Fu was measured by MTT assay and the combination index ( CI ) values were calculated . Additionally , cell cycle distribution of lapatinib alone and the combination with 5-Fu were detected by flow cytometry analysis . AnnexinV-FITC and propidium iodide stain were used for analyzing the apoptotic cells after cells were treated with either agent alone or in combination . The EGFR and HER2 activated signaling pathways were monitored by western blotting . The combination of lapatinib and 5-Fu synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect on esophageal cancer cells . The potentiation effect of combined treatment was associated with downregulation of EGFR and HER2 signaling pathways because data from western blot analysis showed that lapatinib in combination with 5-Fu markedly reduced the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2 , and inhibited the activation of downstream signaling molecules , such as AKT and ERK . A significant G1 arrest was also observed in cell cycle analysis after exposing cells to lapatinib , however , combination with 5-Fu did not enhance G1 arrest . These results indicate that the combination of the lapatinib and 5-Fu is a promising treatment option for esophageal carcinoma with HER2 amplification .
Mast cells ( MC ) are key effector cells in allergic reactions but also involved in host defence , tissue remodeling , angiogenesis , and fibrogenesis . Here , we show that human intestinal fibroblasts ( FB ) suppress apoptosis in human intestinal MC dependent on IL-6 . Intestinal FB produced IL-6 upon direct stimulation by intestinal MC in co-culture or by MC mediators such as TNF-alpha , IL-1beta , tryptase or histamine . MC incubated with IL-6 survived for up to 3 weeks similar to MC co-cultured with FB and MC survival could be blocked by neutralizing anti-IL-6 Abs . Moreover , FB stimulated by MC mediators upregulated their expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 ( MMP-1 ) , a key fibrolytic enzyme . Noteworthy , FB co-cultured with MC or treated with MMP-1 lost confluence and showed increased numbers of apoptotic cells . Our data indicate an intimate cross talk between mucosal MC and FB resulting in MC survival and induction of a fibrolytic rather than a profibrotic state in FB .
Epidemiological studies have indicated that obesity is associated with colorectal cancer . The obesity hormone leptin is considered as a key mediator for cancer development and progression . The present study aims to investigate regulatory effects of leptin on colorectal carcinoma . The expression of leptin and its receptor Ob-R was examined by immunohistochemistry in 108 Chinese patients with colorectal carcinoma . The results showed that leptin/Ob-R expression was significantly associated with T stage , TNM stage , lymph node metastasis , distant metastasis , differentiation and expression of p-mTOR , p-70S6 kinase , and p-Akt . Furthermore , the effects of leptin on proliferation and apoptosis of HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells were determined . The results showed that leptin could stimulate the proliferation and inhibit the apoptosis of HCT-116 colon cells through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway . Ly294002 ( a PI3K inhibitor ) and rapamycin ( an mTOR inhibitor ) could prevent the regulatory effects of leptin on the proliferation and apoptosis of HCT-116 cells via abrogating leptin-mediated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway . All these results indicated that leptin could regulate proliferation and apoptosis of colorectal carcinoma through the PI3K/Akt/ mTOR signalling pathway .
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) is the most common pathological subtype of kidney cancer . Here , we integrated an unbiased genome-wide RNA interference screen for ccRCC survival regulators with an analysis of recurrently overexpressed genes in ccRCC to identify new therapeutic targets in this disease . One of the most potent survival regulators , the monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 ( SLC16A3 ) , impaired ccRCC viability in all eight ccRCC lines tested and was the seventh most overexpressed gene in a meta-analysis of five ccRCC expression datasets . MCT4 silencing impaired secretion of lactate generated through glycolysis and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis . Silencing MCT4 resulted in intracellular acidosis , and reduction in intracellular ATP production together with partial reversion of the Warburg effect in ccRCC cell lines . Intra-tumoural heterogeneity in the intensity of MCT4 protein expression was observed in primary ccRCCs . MCT4 protein expression analysis based on the highest intensity of expression in primary ccRCCs was associated with poorer relapse-free survival , whereas modal intensity correlated with Fuhrman nuclear grade . Consistent with the potential selection of subclones enriched for MCT4 expression during disease progression , MCT4 expression was greater at sites of metastatic disease . These data suggest that MCT4 may serve as a novel metabolic target to reverse the Warburg effect and limit disease progression in ccRCC .
An acquired mutation ( T790M ) in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) accounts for half of all relapses in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients who initially respond to EGFR kinase inhibitors . In this study , we demonstrated for the first time that EGFR-T790M interacts with the cytoskeletal components , myosin heavy chain 9 ( MYH9 ) and beta-actin , in the nucleus of H1975 cells carrying the T790M-mutant EGFR . The interactions of EGFR with MYH9 and beta-actin were reduced in the presence of blebbistatin , a specific inhibitor for the MYH9-beta-actin interaction , suggesting that the EGFR interaction with MYH9 and beta-actin is affected by the integrity of the cytoskeleton . These physical interactions among MYH9 , beta-actin , and EGFR were also impaired by CL-387,785 , a kinase inhibitor for EGFR-T790M . Furthermore , CL-387,785 and blebbistatin interacted in a synergistic fashion to suppress cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in H1975 cells . The combination of CL-387,785 and blebbistatin enhanced the down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) , a transcriptional target of nuclear EGFR . Overall , our findings demonstrate that disrupting EGFR interactions with the cytoskeletal components enhanced the anti-cancer effects of CL-387,785 against H1975 cells , suggesting a novel therapeutic approach for NSCLC cells that express the drug-resistant EGFR-T790M .
The progression of prostate cancers ( PCs ) to locally invasive , androgen-independent and metastatic disease states is generally associated with treatment resistance and disease relapse . The present study was undertaken to establish the possibility of using a combination of specific oncogenic products , including epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , pAkt , nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 ( MIC-1 ) as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for optimizing the management of patients with localized PC at earlier disease stages . The immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence data have revealed that the expression levels of EGFR , Ser(473)-pAkt , NF-kappaB p65 and MIC-1 proteins were significantly enhanced in the same subset of 76 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma specimens during the disease progression and these biomarkers were expressed in a small subpopulation of CD133(+) PC cells and the bulk tumor mass of CD133(-) PC cells . Importantly , all of these biomarkers were also overexpressed in 80-100% of 30 PC metastasis bone tissue specimens . Moreover , the results have indicated that the EGF-EGFR signaling pathway can provide critical functions for the self-renewal of side population ( SP ) cells endowed with stem cell-like features from highly invasive WPE1-NB26 cells . Of therapeutic interest , the targeting of EGFR , pAkt , NF-kappaB or MIC-1 was also effective at suppressing the basal and EGF-promoted prostasphere formation by SP WPE1-NB26 cells , inducing disintegration of SP cell-derived prostaspheres and decreasing the viability of SP and non-SP WPE1-NB26 cell fractions . Also , the targeting of these oncogenic products induced the caspase-dependent apoptosis in chemoresistant SP WPE1-NB26 cells and enhanced their sensibility to the cytotoxic effects induced by docetaxel . These findings suggest that the combined use of EGFR , pAkt , NF-kappaB and/or MIC-1 may represent promising strategies for improving the accuracy of current diagnostic and prognostic methods and efficacy of treatments of PC patients in considering the disease heterogeneity , thereby preventing PC progression to metastatic and lethal disease states .
BACKGROUND Estrogen receptor beta ( ERbeta ) is the predominant ER in the colorectal epithelium , whose expression is greatly reduced in colorectal cancer compared with normal colon tissue . Recent in vitro studies suggested that ERbeta may suppress tumor growth . No research was reported whether ERbeta can be used as therapeutic agent for colon cancer . METHODS In this study , ERbeta gene constructed into adenoviral ( Ad ) vectors was used to treat colon cancer HCT-116 cells alone or in combination with raloxifene . In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to investigate the therapeutic effects of ERbeta and raloxifene in HCT-116 cells . RESULTS Our results indicated that , although Ad-ERbeta alone had no effect on the proliferation of HCT-116 cells , the combination of Ad-ERbeta with raloxifene significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCT-116 cells . The apparently apoptotic induction effects may partly explain the cytotoxicity of the two agents . The results of the study of ERbeta on migration and invasion of HCT-116 cells demonstrated that overexpression of ERbeta significantly decreased cell migration and increased invasion of cells . The antitumor efficacies of ERbeta as well as raloxifene were further investigated on HCT-116 tumor bearing mice . Results demonstrated that both Ad-ERbeta and raloxifene individually inhibited tumor growth . The combination group showed the highest inhibitory efficiency compared with other three groups . CONCLUSION These findings demonstrated that combined administration of Ad-ERbeta with raloxifene represents a promising colon cancer therapeutic strategy .
BACKGROUND Neuroblastoma ( NBL ) is a common pediatric solid tumor , and outcomes for patients with advanced neuroblastoma remain poor despite extremely aggressive treatment . Chemotherapy resistance at relapse contributes heavily to treatment failure . The poor survival of patients with high-risk NBL prompted this investigation into novel treatment options with the objective of gaining a better understanding of resistance mechanisms . On the basis of previous work and on data from publicly available studies , the authors hypothesized that human epidermal growth factor receptor 4 ( Her4 ) contributes to resistance . METHODS Her4 expression was reduced with small-hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) to over express intracellular HER4 , and the authors tested its impact on tumor cell survival under various culture conditions . The resulting changes in gene expression after HER4 knockdown were measured by using a messenger RNA ( mRNA ) array . RESULTS HER4 expression was up-regulated in tumor spheres compared with the expression in monolayer culture . With HER4 knockdown , NBL cells became less resistant to anoikis and serum starvation . Moreover , HER4 knockdown increased the chemosensitivity of NBL cells to cisplatin , doxorubicin , etoposide , and activated ifosfamide . In mRNA array analysis , HER4 knockdown predominately altered genes related to cell cycle regulation . In NBL spheres compared with monolayers , cell proliferation was decreased , and cyclin D expression was reduced . HER4 knockdown reversed cyclin D suppression . Overexpressed intracellular HER4 slowed the cell cycle and induced chemoresistance . CONCLUSIONS The current results indicated that HER4 protects NBL cells from multiple exogenous apoptotic stimuli , including anoikis , nutrient deficiency , and cytotoxic chemotherapy . The intracellular fragment of HER4 was sufficient to confer this phenotype . HER4 functions as a cell cycle suppressor , maintaining resistance to cellular stress . The current findings indicate that HER4 overexpression may be associated with refractory disease , and HER4 may be an important therapeutic target .
Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) is an important inflammatory cytokine and induces many cellular responses , including inflammation , cell proliferation , apoptosis , and necrosis . It is known that receptor interacting protein ( RIP ) kinases , RIP1 and RIP3 , are key effectors of TNF-induced necrosis , but little is known about how these two RIP kinases mediate this process , although reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation and JNK activation have been suggested to be two downstream events of RIP kinases . Here we report the identification of mixed lineage kinase domain-like , MLKL , as a key RIP3 downstream component of TNF-induced necrosis . Through screening a kinase/phosphatase shRNA library in human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells , we found that knockdown of MLKL blocked TNF-induced necrosis . Our data suggest that MLKL functions downstream of RIP1 and RIP3 and is recruited to the necrosome through its interaction with RIP3 . Finally , we found that MLKL is required for the generation of ROS and the late-phase activation of JNK during TNF-induced necrosis . However , because these two events are not involved in TNF-induced necrosis in HT-29 cells , the target of MLKL during TNF-induced necrosis remains elusive . Taken together , our study suggests that MLKL is a key RIP3 downstream component of TNF-induced necrotic cell death .
EBV latent antigen EBNA3C is indispensible for in vitro B-cell immortalization resulting in continuously proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) . EBNA3C was previously shown to target pRb for ubiquitin-proteasome mediated degradation , which facilitates G1 to S transition controlled by the major transcriptional activator E2F1 . E2F1 also plays a pivotal role in regulating DNA damage induced apoptosis through both p53-dependent and -independent pathways . In this study , we demonstrate that in response to DNA damage LCLs knocked down for EBNA3C undergo a drastic induction of apoptosis , as a possible consequence of both p53- and E2F1-mediated activities . Importantly , EBNA3C was previously shown to suppress p53-induced apoptosis . Now , we also show that EBNA3C efficiently blocks E2F1-mediated apoptosis , as well as its anti-proliferative effects in a p53-independent manner , in response to DNA damage . The N- and C-terminal domains of EBNA3C form a stable pRb independent complex with the N-terminal DNA-binding region of E2F1 responsible for inducing apoptosis . Mechanistically , we show that EBNA3C represses E2F1 transcriptional activity via blocking its DNA-binding activity at the responsive promoters of p73 and Apaf-1 apoptosis induced genes , and also facilitates E2F1 degradation in an ubiquitin-proteasome dependent fashion . Moreover , in response to DNA damage , E2F1 knockdown LCLs exhibited a significant reduction in apoptosis with higher cell-viability . In the presence of normal mitogenic stimuli the growth rate of LCLs knockdown for E2F1 was markedly impaired ; indicating that E2F1 plays a dual role in EBV positive cells and that active engagement of the EBNA3C-E2F1 complex is crucial for inhibition of DNA damage induced E2F1-mediated apoptosis . This study offers novel insights into our current understanding of EBV biology and enhances the potential for development of effective therapies against EBV associated B-cell lymphomas .
Gastrin stimulates the growth of pancreatic cancer cells through the activation of the cholecystokinin-B receptor ( CCK-BR ) , which has been found to be overexpressed in pancreatic cancer . In this study , we proposed that the CCK-BR drives growth of pancreatic cancer ; hence , interruption of CCK-BR activity could potentially be an ideal target for cancer therapeutics . The effect of CCK-BR downregulation in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells was examined by utilizing specific CCK-BR-targeted RNA interference reagents . The CCK-BR receptor expression was both transiently and stably downregulated by transfection with selective CCK-BR small-interfering RNA or short-hairpin RNA , respectively , and the effects on cell growth and apoptosis were assessed . CCK-BR downregulation resulted in reduced cancer cell proliferation , decreased DNA synthesis , and cell cycle arrest as demonstrated by an inhibition of G(1) to S phase progression . Furthermore , CCK-BR downregulation increased caspase-3 activity , TUNEL-positive cells , and decreased X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression , suggesting apoptotic activity . Pancreatic cancer cell mobility was decreased when the CCK-BR was downregulated , as assessed by a migration assay . These results show the importance of the CCK-BR in regulation of growth and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer . Strategies to decrease the CCK-BR expression and activity may be beneficial for the development of new methods to improve the treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer .
OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) is a complex disease process involving interactions with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells . We further investigated these relationships by suppressing stromal cell growth through the inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) . STUDY DESIGN Preclinical investigation . METHODS HNSCC cell lines ( FADU , OSC19 , Cal27 , SCC1 , SCC5 , SCC22A ) , fibroblast ( HS27 ) , and endothelial cells ( human umbilical vascular endothelial cell ) were cultured individually or in coculture . Proliferation was assessed following treatment with a range of physiologic concentrations of FGFR inhibitor PD173074 . Mice bearing established HNSCC xenografts were treated with PD173074 ( 12 mg/kg ) , and tumor histology was analyzed for stromal composition , proliferation ( Ki67 staining ) , and apoptosis ( TUNEL [ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling ] staining ) . RESULTS In vitro , inhibition of FGFR with PD173074 dramatically reduced proliferation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells compared to untreated controls . However , HNSCC cell proliferation was not affected by inhibition of FGFR . When cocultured with fibroblasts , HNSCC cells proliferation increased by 15% to 80% ( P < .01 ) . Furthermore , this fibroblast-enhanced tumor cell growth was suppressed by FGFR inhibition . Additionally , treatment of mice bearing HNSCC xenografts with PD173074 resulted in significant growth inhibition ( P < .001 ) . Additionally , those tumors from mice treated with PD173074 had a smaller stromal component , decreased proliferation , and increased apoptosis . CONCLUSIONS Targeting the FGFR pathway in head and neck cancer acts through the stromal components to decrease HNSCC growth in vivo and in vitro .
Certain components of apples have been shown to prevent cancer growth and impede cancer progression . We hypothesized that extracted apple polysaccharides ( APs ) might , therefore , have anticancer effects , through a mechanism involving the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells , partly via the NF-kappaB pathway . Two human colorectal cancer ( CRC ) cell lines , HT-29 and SW620 , were exposed to different concentrations of APs ( 0.01 , 0.1 or 1 mg/ml ) . Cell apoptosis was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay by flow cytometry and incorporation of 5'-bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) into DNA to identify the proliferating cell fraction , using fluorescence microscopy in vitro . The protein levels of NF-kappaB/p65 , I-kappaBalpha , pI-kappaBalpha , Bax , Bcl-xl and Bcl-2 were evaluated by western blotting . The target sites of APs on CRC cells were assessed by flow cytometry . At concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mg/ml , APs showed apoptosis-inducing effects , increased expressions of Bax , nuclear p65 and cytoplasmic pI-kappaBalpha , and decreased expressions of Bcl-2 , Bcl-xl and cytoplasmic I-kappaBalpha . APs induced apoptosis by slightly activating the NF-kappaB pathway ; the AP target site could be the Toll-like receptor 4 on the cell membrane . These results demonstrate the potential of APs as agents for clinical prevention and treatment of CRC .
Carboxypeptidase M ( CPM ) targets the basic amino acids arginine and lysine present at the C-terminus of peptides or proteins . CPM is thought to be involved in inflammatory processes . This is corroborated by CPM-mediated trimming and modulation of inflammatory factors , and expression of the protease in inflammatory environments . Since the function of CPM in and beyond inflammation remains mainly undefined , the identification of natural substrates can aid in discovering the ( patho)physiological role of CPM . CCL1/I-309 , with its three C-terminal basic amino acids , forms a potential natural substrate for CPM . CCL1 plays a role not only in inflammation but also in apoptosis , angiogenesis and tumor biology . Enzymatic processing differently impacts the biological activity of chemokines thereby contributing to the complex regulation of the chemokine system . The aim of the present study was to investigate whether ( i ) CCL1/I-309 is prone to trimming by CPM , and ( ii ) the biological activity of CCL1 is altered after C-terminal proteolytic processing . CCL1 was identified as a novel substrate for CPM in vitro using mass spectrometry . C-terminal clipping of CCL1 augmented intracellular calcium release mediated by CCR8 but reduced the binding of CCL1 to CCR8 . In line with the higher intracellular calcium release , a pronounced increase of the anti-apoptotic activity of CCL1 was observed in the BW5147 cellular model . CCR8 signaling , CCR8 binding and anti-apoptotic activity were unaffected when CPM was exposed to the carboxypeptidase inhibitor DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidino-ethylthiopropanoic acid . The results of this study suggest that CPM is a likely candidate for the regulation of biological processes relying on the CCL1-CCR8 system .
Curcumin , a well-known chemopreventive agent from turmeric , inhibits the expression of several oncogenes and cell proliferation genes in tumor cells . This study aims to understand the precise molecular mechanism by which curcumin exerts its effects on retinoblastoma cells , by performing whole genome microarray analysis to determine the gene expression profiles altered by curcumin treatment . Curcumin suppressed cell viability and altered the cell cycle of retinoblastoma cells . We identified 903 downregulated genes and 1,319 upregulated genes when compared with the control cells after treatment with 20 muM curcumin concentration for 48 h . These genes were grouped into respective functional categories according to their biological function . We found that curcumin regulated the expression of genes that are involved in the regulation of apoptosis , tumor suppressor , cell-cycle arrest , transcription factor , and angiogenesis . Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) analysis was used to validate the results of genome array , and the results were consistent with the obtained data . In conclusion , treatment of curcumin affects the expression of genes involved in various cellular functions and plays an important role in tumor metastasis and apoptosis . Thus , curcumin might be an effective chemopreventive agent for retinoblastoma cancer .
Manipulating acetylation status of key gene targets is likely to be crucial for effective cancer therapy . In this study , we utilized green tea catechins , epicatechin ( EC ) , epigallocatechin ( EGC ) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG ) to examine the regulation of androgen receptor acetylation in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells by histone acetyl-transferase ( HAT ) activity . EC , EGC and EGCG induced prostate cancer cell death , suppressed agonist-dependent androgen receptor ( AR ) activation and AR-regulated gene transcription . These results demonstrated a similar tendency to HAT inhibitory activities ; EGCG>EGC>EC . The strongest HAT inhibitor among them , EGCG ( 50 <FFFD>M ) , downregulated AR acetylation and finally , AR protein translocation to nucleus from the cytoplasmic compartment was effectively inhibited in the presence of the agonist . These results suggest another mechanism to develop effective therapeutics based on green tea catechins .
Furan , a potent rodent liver carcinogen , is found in many cooked food items and thus represents a human cancer risk . Mechanisms for furan carcinogenicity were investigated in male F344 rats using the in vivo Comet and micronucleus assays , combined with analysis of histopathological and gene expression changes . In addition , formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase ( Fpg ) and endonuclease III ( EndoIII)-sensitive DNA damage was monitored as a measure of oxidative DNA damage . Rats were treated by gavage on four consecutive days with 2 , 4 , and 8mg/kg bw furan , doses that were tumorigenic in 2-year cancer bioassays , and with two higher doses , 12 and 16mg/kg . Rats were killed 3h after the last dose , a time established as producing maximum levels of DNA damage in livers of furan-treated rats . Liver Comet assays indicated that both DNA strand breaks and oxidized purines and pyrimidines increased in a near-linear dose-responsive fashion , with statistically significant increases detected at cancer bioassay doses . No DNA damage was detected in bone marrow , a non-target tissue for cancer , and peripheral blood micronucleus assays were negative . Histopathological evaluation of liver from furan-exposed animals produced evidence of inflammation , single-cell necrosis , apoptosis , and cell proliferation . In addition , genes related to apoptosis , cell-cycle checkpoints , and DNA-repair were expressed at a slightly lower level in the furan-treated livers . Although a mixed mode of action involving direct DNA binding cannot be ruled out , the data suggest that furan induces cancer in rat livers mainly through a secondary genotoxic mechanism involving oxidative stress , accompanied by inflammation , cell proliferation , and toxicity .
BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death throughout the world , and the risk to develop this malignant disease seems to be associated with long-term cigarette smoking . Nicotine , one of the major components of cigarette smoking , can stimulate cell proliferation and suppress apoptosis both in normal cells and in several human cancer cell lines derived from various organs . However , although nicotine appears to have a role in stimulating cell proliferation of colon cancer cells , there is no information on its role in inhibiting apoptosis in these cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS Human colorectal cancer cell lines Caco-2 and HCT-8 were treated with 1 muM nicotine alone or in combination with 1 muM alpha-BTX in complete or in serum free medium . Cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined by cell count performed with a cell counter and by cytofluorimetric assay respectively . PI3K/Akt and PKC/ERK1/2 pathways , survivin , and P-Bcl2 ( Ser70 ) were investigated by Western blot analysis . RESULTS Nicotine induced an increase in cell proliferation and a decrease of apoptosis in Caco-2 and HCT-8 cells . Both cell growth and apoptosis appear to be mediated by alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors , since treatment with alpha-Bungarotoxin inhibited these processes . Nicotine induced a statistically significant increase in the expression of PI3K and in P-Akt/Akt ratio as well as in the expression of PKC , ERK1/2 , survivin , and P-Bcl2 ( Ser70 ) in both cell lines . CONCLUSIONS Nicotine , contained in cigarette smoking , could participate in colon cancer development and progression by stimulating cell proliferation and suppressing physiological apoptosis .
BACKGROUND Recent data indicate the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) pathway is required for VEGF production and angiogenesis in various types of cancers . STAT3 inhibitors have been shown to reduce tumor microvessel density in tumors but a direct anti-angiogenic activity has not been described . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We investigated the direct action of a small molecule inhibitor of STAT3 ( LLL12 ) in human umbilical cord vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) in vitro , in a Matrigel model for angiogenesis in vivo , and its antitumor activity in a xenograft model of osteosarcoma . LLL12 ( 100 nM ) significantly inhibited VEGF-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation in HUVECs , reduced their proliferation/migration and inhibited VEGF-induced tube formation . Morphologic analysis of LLL12 treated HUVECs demonstrated marked changes in actin/tubulin distribution and bundling . In scid mice , LLL12 reduced microvessel invasion into VEGF-infused Matrigel plugs by ~90% at a dose of 5 mg/kg daily . Following a period of tumor progression ( 2 weeks ) , LLL12 completely suppressed further growth of established OS-1 osteosarcoma xenografts . Pharmacodynamic studies showed robust phosphorylated STAT3 in control tumors , whereas phospho-STAT3 was not detected in LLL12-treated OS-1 tumors . Treated tumors demonstrated decreased proliferation ( Ki67 staining ) , and decreased microvessel density ( CD34 staining ) , but no significant increase in apoptosis ( TUNEL staining ) , relative to controls . Assay of angiogenic factors , using an antibody array , showed VEGF , MMP-9 , Angiopoietin1/2 , Tissue Factor and FGF-1 expression were dramatically reduced in LLL12-treated tumors compared to control tumors . CONCLUSIONS These findings provide the first evidence that LLL12 effectively inhibits tumor angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo .
BACKGROUND The isothiocyanate sulforaphane ( SFN ) possesses interesting anticancer activities . However , recent studies reported that SFN promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) as well as DNA breakage . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We investigated whether SFN is able to damage RNA , whose loss of integrity was demonstrated in different chronic diseases . Considering the ability of SFN to protect from genotoxicity , we also examined whether SFN is able to protect from RNA damage induced by different chemicals ( doxorubicin , spermine , S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine , H(2)O(2) ) . We observed that SFN was devoid of either RNA damaging and RNA protective activity in human leukemic cells . It was able to potentiate the RNA damage by doxorubicin and spermine . In the first case , the effect was attributable to its ability of modulating the bioreductive activation of doxorubicin . For spermine , the effects were mainly due to its modulation of ROS levels produced by spermine metabolism . As to the cytotoxic relevance of the RNA damage , we found that the treatment of cells with a mixture of spermine or doxorubicin plus SFN increased their proapoptotic potential . Thus it is conceivable that the presence of RNA damage might concur to the overall toxic response induced by a chemical agent in targeted cells . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Since RNA is emerging as a potential target for anticancer drugs , its ability to enhance spermine- and doxorubicin-induced RNA damage and cytotoxicity could represent an additional mechanism for the potentiating effects of SFN associated with anticancer drugs .
BACKGROUND Apigenin , a natural plant flavone , may have chemopreventive and therapeutic potentials for anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , and anti-cancer . Nevertheless , the anti-tumor effect of apigenin on human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) is not fully understood . METHODS The antioxidant capacity and protective effects of apigenin against oxidative stress in murine normal embryonic liver BNLCL2 cells are examined . Cell viability , morphologic change , clonogenic survival , cell cycle distribution , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , glutathione formation , and death receptors- and Bcl-2-mediated caspase pathways of HNSCC SCC25 cells and A431 cells with apigenin are investigated . RESULTS Apigenin inhibits the growth of SCC25 and A431 cells and induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase . Apigenin has an antioxidant capacity as well as the ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation . It protects BNLCL2 cells against oxidative damage , and is potentially able to prevent cancer . Apigenin increases intracellular ROS levels and reduces levels of glutathione ; it also induces cell apoptosis via tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNF-R)- , TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor ( TRAIL-R)- , and Bcl-2-mediated caspase-dependent cell death pathways in SCC25 cells . The combination of apigenin with 5-fluorouracil ( 5-Fu ) or cisplatin induces the dramatic death of SCC25 cells . CONCLUSIONS Apigenin induces SCC25 cell apoptosis via the up-regulation of both TNF-R and TRAIL-R signaling pathways , and has a synergistic effect on the inhibition of cell proliferation in combination with 5-Fu or cisplatin . GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE These analytical findings suggest that apigenin may be a good therapeutic agent against HNSCC cells .
We investigated the effects of valproic acid ( VPA ) , a histone deacetylase inhibitor , in combination with hydralazine , a DNA methylation inhibitor , on the expression of cell-surface Fas and MHC-class I-related chain molecules A and B ( MICA and B ) , the ligands of NKG2D which is an activating receptor of NK cells , and on production of their soluble forms in HOS , U-2 OS and SaOS-2 human osteosarcoma cell lines . We also examined the susceptibility of these cells to Fas- and NK cell-mediated cell death . VPA did not increase the expression of Fas on the surface of osteosarcoma cells , while hydralazine did , and the combination of VPA with hydralazine increased the expression of cell-surface Fas . In contrast , the combination of VPA with hydralazine did not increase the production of soluble Fas by osteosarcoma cells . Both VPA and hydralazine increased the expression of cell-surface MICA and B in osteosarcoma cells , and their combination induced a greater increase in their expression . VPA inhibited the production of both soluble MICA and MICB by osteosarcoma cells while hydralazine produced no effect . Both VPA and hydralazine enhanced the susceptibility of osteosarcoma cells to Fas- and NK cell-mediated cell death and the combination of VPA with hydralazine further enhanced the effects . The present results suggest that combined administration of VPA and hydrazine is valuable for enhancing the therapeutic effects of immunotherapy for osteosarcomas .
Oxidative stress is the main etiological factor behind the pathogenesis of various diseases including inflammation , cancer , cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders . Due to the spin trapping abilities and various pharmacological properties of nitrones , their application as therapeutic agent has been gaining attention . Though the antioxidant properties of the nitrones are well known , the mechanism by which they modulate the cellular defense machinery against oxidative stress is not well investigated and requires further elucidation . Here , we have investigated the mechanisms of cytoprotection of the nitrone spin traps against oxidative stress in bovine aortic endothelial cells ( BAEC ) . Cytoprotective properties of both the cyclic nitrone 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide ( DMPO ) and linear nitrone alpha-phenyl N-tert-butyl nitrone ( PBN ) against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity were investigated . Preincubation of BAEC with PBN or DMPO resulted in the inhibition of H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis . Nitrone-treatment resulted in the induction and restoration of phase II antioxidant enzymes via nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf-2 ) in oxidatively-challenged cells . Furthermore , the nitrones were found to inhibit the mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent activation of caspase-3 induced by H2O2 . Significant down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins p53 and Bax , and up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and p-Bad were observed when the cells were preincubated with the nitrones prior to H2O2-treatment . It was also observed that Nrf-2 silencing completely abolished the protective effects of nitrones . Hence , these findings suggest that nitrones confer protection to the endothelial cells against oxidative stress by modulating phase II antioxidant enzymes and subsequently inhibiting mitochondria-dependent apoptotic cascade .
The results of experimental studies have indicated the pleiotropic effects of statins in organism , e.g. the influence on cell cycle , apoptosis or angiogenesis . In this study , the effects of simvastatin on selected parameters of apoptosis and proliferation in chemocarcinogen-induced mammary tumorigenesis in female rats were determined . Simvastatin was administered dietary at a dose of 18 mg/kg and highly effective dose of 180 mg/kg the entire experiment ( 18 weeks ) . At autopsy mammary tumors were removed and prepared for immunohistochemical and histomorphological analysis . In treated animals ( simvastatin 180 mg/kg ) , significant decrease by 12% in Bcl-2 protein expression and non-significant decrease by 27% of Ki67 protein expression in tumor cells compared to tumor cells in control animals were observed after semiquantitative evaluation . Morphometrical analysis has shown significant proapototic shift in Bcl-2/Bax ratio in tumor cells . In high grade control carcinoma cells , the expression of Ki67 increased by 37% ( non-significantly ) in comparison with control low grade carcinomas . A histomorphological analysis of malignant tumors has revealed a shift from high grade to low grade carcinomas after simvastatin treatment . The noticeable decrease of mammary tumor frequency and incidence in rats after simvastatin treatment was accompanied with antiapoptotic Blc-2 protein decrease and proapoptotic Bax protein increase in this experiment .
The functional and therapeutic importance of the Warburg effect is increasingly recognized , and glycolysis has become a target of anticancer strategies . We recently reported the identification of a group of novel small compounds that inhibit basal glucose transport and reduce cancer cell growth by a glucose deprivation-like mechanism . We hypothesized that the compounds target Glut1 and are efficacious in vivo as anticancer agents . Here , we report that a novel representative compound WZB117 not only inhibited cell growth in cancer cell lines but also inhibited cancer growth in a nude mouse model . Daily intraperitoneal injection of WZB117 at 10 mg/kg resulted in a more than 70% reduction in the size of human lung cancer of A549 cell origin . Mechanism studies showed that WZB117 inhibited glucose transport in human red blood cells ( RBC ) , which express Glut1 as their sole glucose transporter . Cancer cell treatment with WZB117 led to decreases in levels of Glut1 protein , intracellular ATP , and glycolytic enzymes . All these changes were followed by increase in ATP-sensing enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) and declines in cyclin E2 as well as phosphorylated retinoblastoma , resulting in cell-cycle arrest , senescence , and necrosis . Addition of extracellular ATP rescued compound-treated cancer cells , suggesting that the reduction of intracellular ATP plays an important role in the anticancer mechanism of the molecule . Senescence induction and the essential role of ATP were reported for the first time in Glut1 inhibitor-treated cancer cells . Thus , WZB117 is a prototype for further development of anticancer therapeutics targeting Glut1-mediated glucose transport and glucose metabolism .
Helicobacter hepaticus-infected Rag2(-/-) mice emulate many aspects of human inflammatory bowel disease , including the development of colitis and colon cancer . To elucidate mechanisms of inflammation-induced carcinogenesis , we undertook a comprehensive analysis of histopathology , molecular damage , and gene expression changes during disease progression in these mice . Infected mice developed severe colitis and hepatitis by 10wk post-infection , progressing into colon carcinoma by 20wk post-infection , with pronounced pathology in the cecum and proximal colon marked by infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages . Transcriptional profiling revealed decreased expression of DNA repair and oxidative stress response genes in colon , but not in liver . Mass spectrometric analysis revealed higher levels of DNA and RNA damage products in liver compared to colon and infection-induced increases in 5-chlorocytosine in DNA and RNA and hypoxanthine in DNA . Paradoxically , infection was associated with decreased levels of DNA etheno adducts . Levels of nucleic acid damage from the same chemical class were strongly correlated in both liver and colon . The results support a model of inflammation-mediated carcinogenesis involving infiltration of phagocytes and generation of reactive species that cause local molecular damage leading to cell dysfunction , mutation , and cell death . There are strong correlations among histopathology , phagocyte infiltration , and damage chemistry that suggest a major role for neutrophils in inflammation-associated cancer progression . Further , paradoxical changes in nucleic acid damage were observed in tissue- and chemistry-specific patterns . The results also reveal features of cell stress response that point to microbial pathophysiology and mechanisms of cell senescence as important mechanistic links to cancer .
Past studies have shown that amplified insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF1)/IGF1 receptor ( IGF1-R ) signalling has an important role in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) development , progression and resistance to treatment . In this report , we demonstrate that downregulation of microRNA-497 ( miR-497 ) as a result of DNA copy number reduction is involved in upregulation of IGF1-R in CRC cells . MiR-497 and miR-195 of the miR-15/16/195/424/497 family that share the same 3 ' untranslated region ( 3'UTR ) binding seed sequence and are predicted to target IGF1-R were concurrently downregulated in the majority of CRC tissues relative to paired adjacent normal mucosa . However , only overexpression of miR-497 led to suppression of the IGF1-R 3'UTR activity and downregulation of the endogenous IGF1-R protein in CRC cells . This was associated with inhibition of cell survival , proliferation and invasion , and increased sensitivity to apoptosis induced by various stimuli including the chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil , and the death ligand tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand . The biological effect of miR-497 on CRC cells was largely mediated by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signalling , as overexpression of an active form of Akt reversed its impact on cell survival and proliferation , recapitulating the effect of overexpression of IGF1-R . Downregulation of miR-497 and miR-195 appeared to associate with copy number loss of a segment of chromosome 17p13.1 , where these miRs are located at proximity . Similarly to miR-195 , the members of the same miR family , miR-424 that was upregulated , and miR-15a , miR-15b and miR-16 that were unaltered in expression in CRC tissues compared with paired adjacent normal mucosa , did not appear to have a role in regulating the expression of IGF1-R . Taken together , these results identify downregulation of miR-497 as an important mechanism of upregulation of IGF1-R in CRC cells that contributes to malignancy of CRC.Oncogene advance online publication , 18 June 2012 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.214 .
Geraniol ( GOH ) , a naturally occurring monoterpene , has been shown to have antiproliferative , cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-inducing effects , and represents a promising cancer chemopreventive agent . In the present study , we investigated the chemopreventive potential of GOH ( 50 and 100 mg kg(-1) body weight ) against 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene ( DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA)-mediated skin tumorigenesis in Swiss albino mice . The topical treatment of GOH , 30 min prior to TPA ( 2 microg per 200 microl of acetone ) treatment significantly inhibited TPA-induced skin edema , hyperplasia , COX-2 induction and oxidative stress response . The GOH treatment also resulted in reduction of TPA-induced ornithine decarboxylase activity and [ (3) H ] thymidine incorporation by 53% ( P < 0.001 ) and 41% ( P < 0.001 ) , respectively . We found that GOH treatment significantly inhibited the tumor incidence and number of tumors ( P < 0.001 ) and extended the latency period from 4 weeks in DMBA/TPA treatment group to 10 weeks in GOH-pretreated mice . Furthermore , we observed that GOH treatment significantly suppressed the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in skin tumor . Consistently , GOH-treated skin tumors showed reduced expression of Bcl-2 and increased expression of Bax in these lesions . Thus , it was concluded that GOH inhibits DMBA/TPA-mediated skin tumorigenesis by attenuating the Ras proliferation pathway and inducing pro-apoptotic state via inhibition of oxidative stress response and inflammation .
The apoptotic effects of interferon lambdas ( IFNlambdas ) have been described in several types of cancers . However , their effects on human lung cancer cells and the mechanisms are elusive . In addition , the interaction between IFNlambdas and other interferons remains unclear . The interplay between IFNalpha and IFNlambda has been reported . However , although IFNgamma is a well-known regulatory interferon , the mechanisms through which it regulates IFNlambdas in lung cancer cells are unknown . These issues are critical for the application of IFNlambdas in lung cancer therapy . In this study , we used A549 , a cell line derived from a human lung carcinoma , to characterize the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of IFNlambdas on lung cancer , and the interplay between IFNgamma and IFNlambda . Because overexpression of full-length ectopic IFNlambdaR1 led to cell death , we generated A549 cells stably expressing a chimeric receptor ( 10R1/lambdaR1 ) , which is composed of the extracellular domain of IL-10 receptor ( IL10R1 ) fused in tandem to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the IFNlambda receptor ( IFNlambdaR1 ) . By comparing with A549 cells stably expressing its cognate vector , we demonstrated that IL-10 stimulation triggered the intracellular IFNlambda signaling via 10R1/lambdaR1 receptor . By using A549 cells expressing 10R1/lambdaR1 , we report that the IFNlambdaR1 chain of IFNlambda receptor possesses an intrinsic ability to trigger apoptosis in human lung cancer cells . Although it did not suppress cell proliferation , IFNlambda signaling via 10R1/lambdaR1 receptor induced cell cycle arrest , externalization of phosphatidylserine , DNA fragmentation , activation of caspase-3 , caspase-8 and caspase-9 . However , the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK did not prevent apoptosis . In addition , the extent of induced apoptosis correlate with the expression levels of the IFNlambda receptor and the levels of STAT1 activation . Lastly , we demonstrated that IFNgamma sensitized A549 cells to IFNlambda-induced apoptosis , via upregulation of IFNlambdaR1 . These data indicate the potential of IFNlambda , alone or in combination with IFNgamma , in the treatment of human lung carcinoma .
Inhibition of cell proliferation by fenoterol and fenoterol derivatives in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells is consistent with beta(2)-adrenergic receptor ( beta(2)-AR ) stimulation . However , the events that result in fenoterol-mediated control of cell proliferation in other cell types are not clear . Here , we compare the effect of the beta(2)-AR agonists ( R,R')-fenoterol ( Fen ) and ( R,R')-4-methoxy-1-naphthylfenoterol ( MNF ) on signaling and cell proliferation in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells by using Western blotting and [ (3)H]thymidine incorporation assays . Despite the expression of beta(2)-AR , no cAMP accumulation was observed when cells were stimulated with isoproterenol or Fen , although the treatment elicited both mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activation . Unexpectedly , isoproterenol and Fen promoted HepG2 cell growth , but MNF reduced proliferation together with increased apoptosis . The mitogenic responses of Fen were attenuated by 3-(isopropylamino)-1-[(7-methyl-4-indanyl)oxy]butan-2-ol ( ICI 118,551 ) , a beta(2)-AR antagonist , whereas those of MNF were unaffected . Because of the coexpression of beta(2)-AR and cannabinoid receptors ( CBRs ) and their impact on HepG2 cell proliferation , these Galpha(i)/Galpha(o)-linked receptors may be implicated in MNF signaling . Cell treatment with ( R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-napthalenylmethanone ( WIN 55,212-2 ) , a synthetic agonist of CB(1)R and CB(2)R , led to growth inhibition , whereas inverse agonists of these receptors blocked MNF mitogenic responses without affecting Fen signaling . MNF responses were sensitive to pertussis toxin . The beta(2)-AR-deficient U87MG cells were refractory to Fen , but responsive to the antiproliferative actions of MNF and WIN 55,212-2 . The data indicate that the presence of the naphthyl moiety in MNF results in functional coupling to the CBR pathway , providing one of the first examples of a dually acting beta(2)-AR-CBR ligand .
Focal inflammation causes systemic fever . Cancer hyperthermia therapy results in shrinkage of tumors by various mechanisms , including induction of adaptive immune response . However , the physiological meaning of systemic fever and mechanisms of tumor shrinkage by hyperthermia have not been completely understood . In this study , we investigated how heat shock influences the adaptive immune system . We established a cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) clone ( #IM29 ) specific for survivin , one of the tumor-associated antigens ( TAAs ) , from survivin peptide-immunized cancer patients ' peripheral blood , and the CTL activities were investigated in several temperature conditions ( 37-41<FFFD>C ) . Cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma secretion of CTL were greatest under 39<FFFD>C condition , whereas they were minimum under 41<FFFD>C . To address the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon , we investigated the apoptosis status of CTLs , expression of CD3 , CD8 , and TCRalphabeta by flow cytometry , and expression of perforin , granzyme B , and Fas ligand by western blot analysis . The expression of perforin and granzyme B were upregulated under temperature conditions of 39 and 41<FFFD>C . On the other hand , CTL cell death was induced under 41<FFFD>C condition with highest Caspase-3 activity . Therefore , the greatest cytotoxicity activity at 39<FFFD>C might depend on upregulation of cytotoxic granule proteins including perforin and granzyme B. These results suggest that heat shock enhances effector phase of the adaptive immune system and promotes eradication of microbe and tumor cells .
Src kinase is elevated in breast tumors that are ER/PR negative and do not overexpress HER2 , but clinical trials with Src inhibitors have shown little activity . The present study evaluated preclinical efficacy of a novel peptidomimetic compound , KX-01 ( KX2-391 ) , that exhibits dual action as an Src and pretubulin inhibitor . KX-01 was evaluated as a single-agent and in combination with paclitaxel in MDA-MB-231 , MDA-MB-157 , and MDA-MB-468 human ER/PR/HER2-negative breast cancer cells . Treatments were evaluated by growth/apoptosis , isobologram analysis , migration/invasion assays , tumor xenograft volume , metastasis , and measurement of Src , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , microtubules , Ki67 , and microvessel density . KX-01 inhibited cell growth in vitro and in combination with paclitaxel resulted in synergistic growth inhibition . KX-01 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 tumor xenografts ( 1 and 5 mg/kg , twice daily ) . KX-01 inhibited activity of Src and downstream mediator FAK in tumors that was coincident with reduced proliferation and angiogenesis and increased apoptosis . KX01 also resulted in microtubule disruption in tumors . Combination of KX-01 with paclitaxel resulted in significant regression of MDA-MB-231 tumors and reduced metastasis to mouse lung and liver . KX-01 is a potently active Src/pretubulin inhibitor that inhibits breast tumor growth and metastasis . As ER/PR/HER2-negative patients are candidates for paclitaxel therapy , combination with KX-01 may potentiate antitumor efficacy in management of this aggressive breast cancer subtype .
Lentinula edodes mycelia ( L.E.M. ) is a dried powder extracted from shiitake mushrooms ( Lentinula edodes ) . We previously demonstrated that it has immunomodulatory effects . In this paper , the direct cytotoxic effects of the polysaccharide-rich fraction of L.E.M . ( L.E.M. ethanol precipitate ; LEP ) on HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells were investigated . LEP directly killed the HepG2 cells efficaciously , but had only minor effects on normal rat hepatocytes and normal mouse dermal cells under the same conditions . Characteristic morphological changes associated with apoptosis such as shrinkage , rounding , and floating as well as chromatin condensation were confirmed ; terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling ( TUNEL ) staining was positive as determined by fluorescence microscopy analyses . The caspase-3 and -8 death receptor pathway was found largely responsible for the apoptotic death of HepG2 cells treated with LEP . In conclusion , LEP can directly induce apoptosis of HepG2 cells , and thus may have potential chemotherapeutic applications for the treatment of HCC .
22Rv1 is a common prostate cancer cell line used in xenograft mouse experiments as well as in vitro cell culture assays to study aspects of prostate cancer tumorigenesis . Recently , this cell line was shown to harbor multiple copies of a gammaretrovirus , called XMRV , integrated in its genome . While the original prostate cancer xenograft CWR22 is free of any retrovirus , subsequently generated cell lines 22Rv1 and CWR-R1 , carry this virus and additionally shed infectious gammaretroviral particles in their supernatant . Although XMRV most likely was generated by recombination events in cell culture this virus has been demonstrated to infect human cells in vitro and 22Rv1 as well as CWR-R1 cells are now considered biosafety 2 reagents . Here , we demonstrate that 22Rv1 cells with reduced retroviral transcription show reduced tumor angiogenesis and increased necrosis of the primary tumor derived from xenografted cells in scid mice when compared to the parental cell line . The presence of XMRV transcripts significantly increases secretion of osteopontin ( OPN ) , CXCL14 , IL13 and TIMP2 in 22Rv1 cells . Furthermore , these data are supported by in vitro cell invasion and differentiation assays . Collectively , our data suggest that the presence of XMRV transcripts at least partially contributes to 22Rv1 characteristics observed in vitro and in vivo with regard to migration , invasion and tumor angiogenesis . We propose that data received with 22Rv1 cells or equivalent cells carrying xenotropic gammaretroviruses should be carefully controlled including other prostate cancer cell lines tested for viral sequences .
Hesperetin , a flavonoid from citrus fruits , has several bioactivities such as anti-inflammatory , antihypertensive , antiatherogenic effects . However , studies elucidating the role and the mechanism(s) of action of hesperetin in cervical cancer are sparse . In this study , we investigated the mechanism of the antiproliferative and apoptotic actions exerted by hesperetin on human cervical cancer SiHa cells . The viability of SiHa cells was evaluated using the MTT assay , apoptosis by acridine orange/ethidium bromide , propidium iodide , TUNEL assay , and Annexin V-Cy3 , cell cycle distribution and mitochondrial transmembrane potential using flow cytometry , and apoptotic marker genes using quantitative real-time PCR . The treatment of SiHa cells with hesperetin ( IC(50,) 650mum ) showed a marked concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation and induced the G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner after 24h . There was an attenuation of mitochondrial membrane potential with increased expression of caspase-3 , caspase-8 , caspase-9 , p53 , Bax , and Fas death receptor and its adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain-containing protein ( FADD ) , indicating the participation of both death receptor- and mitochondria-related mechanisms . Furthermore , hesperetin-induced apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL and Annexin V-Cy3 . This study shows that hesperetin exhibits a potential anticancer activity against human cervical cancer cell lines in vitro through the reduction in cell viability and the induction of apoptosis . Altogether , these data sustain our contention that hesperetin has anticancer properties and merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent .
Depression is the most common psychiatric syndrome in cancer patients and adversely affects anti-cancer immune system and life quality of patients . Antidepressant desipramine ( DMI ) is clinically prescribed in the auxiliary treatment of cancer patients . Increasing evidences suggest that DMI has a broad spectrum of target-off biological effects , such as anticancer properties . Our previous study revealed that DMI at the clinical relevant concentrations could induce CHOP-dependent apoptotic death in C6 glioma cells . In this study , we further explored the pro-autophagic effect of DMI in C6 glioma cells and its underlying mechanism . Treatment with DMI could induce autophagic cell death characterized by the formation of autophagosome and the elevated level of autophagic protein Beclin-1 and cellular redistribution of marker LC3 . Meanwhile , DMI inhibited the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway which is considered as a negative regulator of autophagy . Furthermore , DMI activated PERK-eIF2alpha and ATF6 of endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress pathway , while knockdown of PERK with the PERK-specific short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) could obviously attenuate the autophagy . The results strongly suggested that DMI could induce autophagy through the PERK-ER stress pathway in C6 glioma cells . Our findings provided new insights into another beneficial potential of antidepressant DMI in the adjuvant therapy of cancer .
Regulator of Cullins-1 ( ROC1 ) or RING box protein-1 ( RBX1 ) is an essential RING component of Cullin-RING ligase ( CRL ) . Our previous studies showed that ROC1 is required for the growth of several cancer cell lines while ROC1 siRNA silencing inactivates CRL , leading to cell cycle arrest , cell senescence and/or apoptosis . However , it is completely unknown whether ROC1 knockdown triggers autophagic response by inactivating CRL . Moreover , the role of ROC1 in liver cancer remains elusive . In this study , we reported that ROC1 knockdown significantly inhibited the growth of liver cancer cells by sequentially and independently inducing autophagy and p21-dependent cell senescence . Mechanism analysis revealed that ROC1 silencing triggered autophagy by inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) activity due to accumulation of mTOR-inhibitory protein Deptor , a substrate of CRL . Consistently , Deptor knockdown significantly blocked autophagy response upon ROC1 silencing . Biologically , autophagy response upon ROC1 silencing was a survival signal , and blockage of autophagy pathway sensitized cancer cells to apoptosis . Finally , we demonstrated that ROC1 was overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinomas , which is associated with poor prognosis of liver cancer patients . These findings suggest that ROC1 is an appealing drug target for liver cancer and provide a proof-of-concept evidence for a novel drug combination of ROC1 inhibitor and an autophagy inhibitor for effective treatment of liver cancer by enhancing apoptosis.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication , 31 August 2012 ; doi:10.1038/cdd.2012.113 .
The cadherins are a family of cell surface glycoproteins responsible for cell adhesion which play an important role in cell morphology , contact inhibition and signal transduction during tumorigenesis . Protocadherin 8 ( PCDH8 ) , a member of the cadherin family , has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor involved in oncogenesis in breast cancer . In this study , we aimed to investigate the epigenetic inactivation of PCDH8 and its tumor suppressor function in gastric cancer . The expression of PCDH8 was markedly reduced or silenced in gastric cancer cell lines compared with normal gastric cells or tissues . Methylation of the PCDH8 gene promoter was observed in 100% ( 4/4 ) of cell lines and 55.38% ( 36/65 ) of the primary gastric cancer by methylation-specific PCR , but not in normal gastric mucosa ( 0/10 ) . Methylated PCDH8 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis in a logistic regression analysis . The demethylation reagent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine was able to restore or upregulate PCDH8 expression in gastric cancer cell lines . Ectopic expression of PCDH8 in silenced gastric cancer cells significantly inhibited cell migration and induced apoptosis . For the first time , our study demonstrates the epigenetic inactivation of PCDH8 by promoter methylation and its tumor suppressor function in human gastric cancer . Thus , PCDH8 could be identified as a candidate tumor suppressor in human gastric cancer .
Therapy-induced cellular senescence ( TCS ) , characterized by prolonged cell cycle arrest , is an in vivo response of human cancers to chemotherapy and radiation . Unfortunately , TCS is reversible for a subset of senescent cells , leading to cellular reproliferation and ultimately tumor progression . This invariable consequence of TCS recapitulates the clinical treatment experience of patients with advanced cancer . We report the findings of a clinicopathological study in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer demonstrating that marker of in vivo TCS following neoadjuvant therapy prognosticate adverse clinical outcome . In our efforts to elucidate key molecular pathways underlying TCS and cell cycle escape , we have previously shown that the deregulation of mitotic kinase Cdk1 and its downstream effectors are important mediators of survival and cell cycle reentry . We now report that aberrant expression of Cdk1 interferes with apoptosis and promotes the formation of polyploid senescent cells during TCS . These polyploid senescent cells represent important transition states through which escape preferentially occurs . The Cdk1 pathway is in part modulated differentially by p21 and p27 two members of the KIP cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor family during TCS . Altogether , these studies underscore the importance of TCS in cancer therapeutics .
Cancer cells convert glucose preferentially to lactate even in the presence of oxygen ( aerobic glycolysis-Warburg effect ) . New concepts in cancer treatment aim at inhibition of aerobic glycolysis . Pyruvate dehydrogenase converts pyruvate to acetylCoA thus preventing lactate formation . Therefore , the aim of this study was to evaluate compounds that could activate pyruvate dehydrogenase in cancer cells . We investigated the effects of ( R)-(+)-alpha-lipoic acid ( LPA ) and dichloroacetate ( DCA ) , possible activators of pyruvate dehydrogenase , on suppression of aerobic glycolysis and induction of cell death . The neuroblastoma cell lines Kelly , SK-N-SH , Neuro-2a and the breast cancer cell line SkBr3 were incubated with different concentrations ( 0.1-30 mM ) of LPA and DCA . The effects of both compounds on cell viability/proliferation ( WST-1 assay ) , [ 18F]-FDG uptake , lactate production and induction of apoptosis ( flow cytometric detection of caspase-3 ) were evaluated . Furthermore , NMRI nu/nu mice that had been inoculated s.c. with SkBr3 cells were treated daily for four weeks with LPA ( i.p , 18.5 mg/kg ) starting at day 7 p.i. . Tumor development was measured with a sliding calliper and monitored via [ 18F]-FDG-PET . Residual tumors after therapy were examined histopathologically . These data suggests that LPA can reduce ( 1 ) cell viability/proliferation , ( 2 ) uptake of [ 18F]-FDG and ( 3 ) lactate production and increase apoptosis in all investigated cell lines . In contrast , DCA was almost ineffective . In the mouse xenograft model with s.c . SkBr3 cells , daily treatment with LPA retarded tumor progression . Therefore , LPA seems to be a promising compound for cancer treatment .
Liver cancer ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignancy of all cancers worldwide . According to the principles of traditional Chinese medicine , liver Yin deficiency is a common clinical syndrome of liver cancer , and tonifying liver Yin is a common treatment method for liver cancer . However , no hepatocarcinoma-specific liver Yin tonifying formula has yet been established . In the present study , we established a liver cancer-specific combination of herbs , which we term liver Yin tonifying formula ( LYTF ) . We found that LYTF inhibits the proliferation of Bel-7402 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner . LYTF induces apoptosis in Bel-7402 cells , which is accompanied by activation of caspases-8 , -9 and -3 . Pan-caspase blocking completely abrogates LYTF-induced apoptosis and partially abrogates LYTF-induced proliferation inhibition . LYTF also induces cell senescence , as indicated by a large and flattened morphology , senescence-activated beta-galactosidase-positive staining and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest , accompanied by the up-regulation of p16 and p21 and the down-regulation of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation . These findings suggest that LYTF is effective in inhibiting the growth and survival of hepatocarcinoma cells through the induction of apoptosis and cell senescence . Our study also provides insight into traditional Chinese medicine methods used for the treatment of liver cancer .
Despite insights into the molecular pathways regulating hypoxia-induced gene expression , it is not known which cell types accomplish oxygen sensing during neo-vasculogenesis . We have developed a humanized mouse model of endothelial and mesenchymal progenitor co-transplantation to delineate the cellular compartments responsible for hypoxia response during vasculogenesis . Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells ( MSPCs ) accumulated nuclear hypoxia-inducible transcription factor ( HIF)-1alpha earlier and more sensitively than endothelial colony forming progenitor cells ( ECFCs ) in vitro and in vivo . Hypoxic ECFCs showed reduced function in vitro and underwent apoptosis within 24h in vivo when used without MSPCs . Surprisingly , only in MSPCs did pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of HIF-1alpha abrogate neo-vasculogenesis . HIF deletion in ECFCs caused no effect . ECFCs could be rescued from hypoxia-induced apoptosis by HIF-competent MSPCs resulting in the formation of patent perfused human vessels . Several angiogenic factors need to act in concert to partially substitute mesenchymal HIF-deficiency . Results demonstrate that ECFCs require HIF-competent vessel wall progenitors to initiate vasculogenesis in vivo and to bypass hypoxia-induced apoptosis . We describe a novel mechanistic role of MSPCs as oxygen sensors promoting vasculogenesis thus underscoring their importance for the development of advanced cellular therapies .
TGF-beta derived from bone fuels melanoma bone metastases by inducing tumor secretion of prometastatic factors that act on bone cells to change the skeletal microenvironment . Halofuginone is a plant alkaloid derivative that blocks TGF-beta signaling with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties . Here , we show for the first time that halofuginone therapy decreases development and progression of bone metastasis caused by melanoma cells through the inhibition of TGF-beta signaling . Halofuginone treatment of human melanoma cells inhibited cell proliferation , phosphorylation of SMAD proteins in response to TGF-beta , and TGF-beta-induced SMAD-driven transcription . In addition , halofuginone reduced expression of TGF-beta target genes that enhance bone metastases , including PTHrP , CTGF , CXCR4 , and IL11 . Also , cell apoptosis was increased in response to halofuginone . In nude mice inoculated with 1205Lu melanoma cells , a preventive protocol with halofuginone inhibited bone metastasis . The beneficial effects of halofuginone treatment were comparable with those observed with other anti-TGF-beta strategies , including systemic administration of SD208 , a small-molecule inhibitor of TGF-beta receptor I kinase , or forced overexpression of Smad7 , a negative regulator of TGF-beta signaling . Furthermore , mice with established bone metastases treated with halofuginone had significantly less osteolysis than mice receiving placebo assessed by radiography . Thus , halofuginone is also effective in reducing the progression of melanoma bone metastases . Moreover , halofuginone treatment reduced melanoma metastasis to the brain , showing the potential of this novel treatment against cancer metastasis . Cancer Res ; 72(23) ; 6247-56. <FFFD>2012 AACR .
BACKGROUND Cellular stress responses trigger signaling cascades that inhibit proliferation and protein translation to help alleviate the stress or if the stress cannot be overcome induce apoptosis . In recent studies , we demonstrated the ability of lovastatin , an inhibitor of mevalonate synthesis , to induce the Integrated Stress Response as well as inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) activation . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS In this study , we evaluated the effects of lovastatin on the activity of the LKB1/AMPK pathway that is activated upon cellular energy shortage and can interact with the above pathways . In the squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) cell lines SCC9 and SCC25 , lovastatin treatment ( 1-25 <FFFD>M , 24 hrs ) induced LKB1 and AMPK activation similar to metformin ( 1-10 mM , 24 hrs ) , a known inducer of this pathway . Lovastatin treatment impaired mitochondrial function and also decreased cellular ADP/ATP ratios , common triggers of LKB1/AMPK activation . The cytotoxic effects of lovastatin were attenuated in LKB1 null MEFs indicating a role for this pathway in regulating lovastatin-induced cytotoxicity . Of clinical relevance , lovastatin induces synergistic cytotoxicity in combination with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib . In LKB1 deficient ( A549 , HeLa ) and expressing ( SCC9 , SCC25 ) cell lines , metformin enhanced gefitinib cytotoxicity only in LKB1 expressing cell lines while both groups showed synergistic cytotoxic effects with lovastatin treatments . Furthermore , the combination of lovastatin with gefitinib induced a potent apoptotic response without significant induction of autophagy that is often induced during metabolic stress inhibiting cell death . CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE Thus , targeting multiple metabolic stress pathways including the LKB1/AMPK pathway enhances lovastatin's ability to synergize with gefitinib in SCC cells .
In patients with advanced bladder cancer , glucocorticoids are frequently given to reduce acute toxicity , particularly hyperemesis , during chemotherapy , as well as to improve cachectic conditions . However , it remains unclear whether glucocorticoids directly affect the development and progression of bladder cancer through the glucocorticoid receptor pathway . Glucocorticoid receptor expression was first investigated in human bladder cancer lines and tissue microarrays . Then , the effects of dexamethasone on glucocorticoid receptor transcription , cell proliferation , apoptosis/cell cycle , and invasion were examined in bladder cancer lines . Finally , mouse xenograft models for bladder cancer were used to assess the efficacy of dexamethasone on tumor progression . All the cell lines and tissues examined were found to express glucocorticoid receptor . Dexamethasone increased glucocorticoid receptor-mediated reporter activity and cell proliferation , and inhibited apoptosis in the presence or absence of cisplatin . In contrast , dexamethasone suppressed cell invasion , the expression of its related genes [ MMP-2/MMP-9 , interleukin ( IL)-6 , VEGF ] , and the activity of MMP-2/MMP-9 , and also induced mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition . In addition , dexamethasone increased IkappaBalpha protein levels and cytosolic accumulation of NF-kappaB . In xenograft-bearing mice , dexamethasone slightly augmented the growth of the inoculated tumors but completely prevented the development of bloody ascites , suggestive of peritoneal dissemination of tumor cells , and actual metastasis . In all these assays , dexamethasone effects were abolished by a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist or glucocorticoid receptor knockdown via RNA interference . Thus , glucocorticoid receptor activation resulted in promotion of cell proliferation via inhibiting apoptosis yet repression of cell invasion and metastasis . These results may provide a basis of developing improved chemotherapy regimens , including or excluding glucocorticoid receptor agonists/antagonists , for urothelial carcinoma .
The goal of the present study was to examine hepatic differential gene expression patterns in Fisher-344 rats in response to dietary 2-aminoanthracene ( 2AA ) ingestion for 14 and 28 days . Twenty four post-weaning 3-4 week old F-344 male rats were exposed to 0 mgkg(-1)-diet ( control ) , 50 mgkg(-1)-diet ( low dose ) , 75 mgkg(-1)-diet ( medium dose ) and 100 mgkg(-1)-diet ( high dose ) 2AA for 14 and 28 days . This was followed by analysis of the liver for global gene expression changes . In both time points , the numbers of genes affected seem to correlate with the dose of 2AA . Sixteen mRNAs were differentially expressed in all treatment groups for the short-term exposure group . Similarly , 51 genes were commonly expressed in all 28-day exposure group . Almost all the genes seem to have higher expression relative to the controls . In contrast , cytochrome P450 family 4 , subfamily a , polypeptide 8 ( Cyp4a8 ) , and monocyte to macrophage differentiation-associated ( Mmd2 ) were down-regulated relative to controls . Differentially expressed mRNAs were further analyzed for associations via DAVID . GO categories show the effect of 2AA to be linked with genes responsible for carbohydrate utilization and transport , lipid metabolic processes , stress responses such as inflammation and apoptosis processes , immune system response , DNA damage response , cancer processes and circadian rhythm . The data from the current study identified altered hepatic gene expression profiles that may be associated with carcinoma , autoimmune response , and/or type 2 diabetes . Possible biomarkers due to 2AA toxicity in the liver for future study include Abcb1a , Nhej1 , Adam8 , Cdkn1a , Mgmt , and Nrcam .
BACKGROUND Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive form of malignant glioma and is very difficult to treat . Controlling tumour cell invasion and angiogenesis is essential to improve the prognosis of glioblastoma patients . Since constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) is necessary for tumour progression , NF-kappaB may be an important pharmacological target for this disease . Our study aimed to evaluate the antitumour effects of parthenolide , a NF-kappaB inhibitor , in two human glioblastoma cell lines ( U87MG and U373 ) and in glioblastoma xenografts . Furthermore , we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects . METHODS The anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic effects of parthenolide were analysed using in vitro invasion and angiogenesis assays . Parthenolide-induced growth inhibition of glioblastoma cells in vitro was determined using the MTT ( methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ) assay . In addition , the effect of parthenolide on orthotropic implantation in vivo was evaluated using an intracerebral human glioblastoma xenograft model . RESULTS We found that parthenolide suppresses proliferation , invasion , and tumour- induced angiogenesis of glioblastoma cells . Molecular studies demonstrated that parthenolide suppresses gene and protein expression of angiogenic factors . Furthermore , parthenolide reduced Akt phosphorylation and activated mitochondrial signalling , suggesting that the antitumour function of parthenolide may be mediated not only by the inhibition of NF-kappaB but also by the inhibition of Akt signalling and the activation of apoptotic proteins . Parthenolide suppressed neovascularity and tumour growth in glioblastoma xenografts . CONCLUSION The present study identified parthenolide as a new therapeutic agent for glioblastomas .
Overexpression of cyclin D1 is believed to endow mammary epithelial cells ( MEC ) with a proliferative advantage by virtue of its contribution to pRB inactivation . Accordingly , abrogation of the kinase-dependent function of cyclin D1 is sufficient to render mice resistant to breast cancer initiated by ErbB2 . Here , we report that mouse cyclin D1(KE/KE) MECs ( deficient in cyclin D1 activity ) upregulate an autophagy-like process but fail to implement ErbB2-induced senescence in vivo . In addition , immortalized cyclin D1(KE/KE) MECs retain high rates of autophagy and reduced ErbB2-mediated transformation in vitro . However , highlighting its dual role during tumorigenesis , downregulation of autophagy led to an increase in senescence in cyclin D1(KE/KE) MECs . Autophagy upregulation was also confirmed in human mammary epithelial cells ( HMEC ) subjected to genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of cyclin D1 activity and , similar to our murine system , simultaneous inhibition of Cdk4/6 and autophagy in HMECs enhanced the senescence response . Collectively , our findings suggest a previously unrecognized function of cyclin D1 in suppressing autophagy in the mammary epithelium . Cancer Res ; 72(24) ; 6477-89. <FFFD>2012 AACR .
Angiogenesis is a crucial step in the growth and metastasis of cancers , since it enables the growing tumor to receive oxygen and nutrients . Cancer prevention using natural products has become an integral part of cancer control . We studied the antiangiogenic activity of quercetin using ex vivo , in vivo and in vitro models . Rat aortic ring assay showed that quercetin at non-toxic concentrations significantly inhibited microvessel sprouting and exhibited a significant inhibition in the proliferation , migration , invasion and tube formation of endothelial cells , which are key events in the process of angiogenesis . Most importantly , quercetin treatment inhibited ex vivo angiogenesis as revealed by chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane assay ( CAM ) and matrigel plug assay . Western blot analysis showed that quercetin suppressed VEGF induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 and their downstream protein kinases AKT , mTOR , and ribosomal protein S6 kinase in HUVECs . Quercetin ( 20 mg/kg/d ) significantly reduced the volume and the weight of solid tumors in prostate xenograft mouse model , indicating that quercetin inhibited tumorigenesis by targeting angiogenesis . Furthermore , quercetin reduced the cell viability and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells , which were correlated with the downregulation of AKT , mTOR and P70S6K expressions . Collectively the findings in the present study suggest that quercetin inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis by targeting VEGF-R2 regulated AKT/mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway , and could be used as a potential drug candidate for cancer therapy .
Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 ( UCP2 ) can moderate oxidative stress by favoring the influx of protons into the mitochondrial matrix , thus reducing electron leakage from respiratory chain and mitochondrial superoxide production . Here , we demonstrate that UCP2 inhibition by genipin or UCP2 siRNA strongly increases reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production inhibiting pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell growth . We also show that UCP2 inhibition triggers ROS-dependent nuclear translocation of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) , formation of autophagosomes , and the expression of the autophagy marker LC3-II . Consistently , UCP2 over-expression significantly reduces basal autophagy confirming the anti-autophagic role of UCP2 . Furthermore , we demonstrate that autophagy induced by UCP2 inhibition determines a ROS-dependent cell death , as indicated by the apoptosis decrease in the presence of the autophagy inhibitors chloroquine ( CQ ) or 3-methyladenine ( 3-MA ) , or the radical scavenger NAC . Intriguingly , the autophagy induced by genipin is able to potentiate the autophagic cell death triggered by gemcitabine , the standard chemotherapeutic drug for pancreatic adenocarcinoma , supporting the development of an anti-cancer therapy based on UCP2 inhibition associated to standard chemotherapy . Our results demonstrate for the first time that UCP2 plays a role in autophagy regulation bringing new insights into mitochondrial uncoupling protein field .
Blind mole rats Spalax ( BMR ) are small subterranean rodents common in the Middle East . BMR is distinguished by its adaptations to life underground , remarkable longevity ( with a maximum documented lifespan of 21 y ) , and resistance to cancer . Spontaneous tumors have never been observed in spalacids . To understand the mechanisms responsible for this resistance , we examined the growth of BMR fibroblasts in vitro of the species Spalax judaei and Spalax golani . BMR cells proliferated actively for 7-20 population doublings , after which the cells began secreting IFN-\u03b2 , and the cultures underwent massive necrotic cell death within 3 d . The necrotic cell death phenomenon was independent of culture conditions or telomere shortening . Interestingly , this cell behavior was distinct from that observed in another long-lived and cancer-resistant African mole rat , Heterocephalus glaber , the naked mole rat in which cells display hypersensitivity to contact inhibition . Sequestration of p53 and Rb proteins using SV40 large T antigen completely rescued necrotic cell death . Our results suggest that cancer resistance of BMR is conferred by massive necrotic response to overproliferation mediated by p53 and Rb pathways , and triggered by the release of IFN-\u03b2 . Thus , we have identified a unique mechanism that contributes to cancer resistance of this subterranean mammal extremely adapted to life underground .
Mps one binder 1a ( MOB1A ) and MOB1B are key components of the Hippo signaling pathway and are mutated or inactivated in many human cancers . Here we show that intact Mob1a or Mob1b is essential for murine embryogenesis and that loss of the remaining WT Mob1 allele in Mob1a(\u0394/\u0394)1b(tr/+) or Mob1a(\u0394/+)1b(tr/tr) mice results in tumor development . Because most of these cancers resembled trichilemmal carcinomas , we generated double-mutant mice bearing tamoxifen-inducible , keratinocyte-specific homozygous-null mutations of Mob1a and Mob1b ( kDKO mice). kDKO mice showed hyperplastic keratinocyte progenitors and defective keratinocyte terminal differentiation and soon died of malnutrition. kDKO keratinocytes exhibited hyperproliferation , apoptotic resistance , impaired contact inhibition , enhanced progenitor self renewal , and increased centrosomes . Examination of Hippo pathway signaling in kDKO keratinocytes revealed that loss of Mob1a/b altered the activities of the downstream Hippo mediators LATS and YAP1 . Similarly , YAP1 was activated in some human trichilemmal carcinomas , and some of these also exhibited MOB1A/1B inactivation . Our results clearly demonstrate that MOB1A and MOB1B have overlapping functions in skin homeostasis , and exert their roles as tumor suppressors by regulating downstream elements of the Hippo pathway .
Regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) ( PAR ) synthesis and turnover is critical to determining cell fate after genotoxic stress . Hyperactivation of PAR synthesis by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( PARP-1 ) occurs when cells deficient in DNA repair are exposed to genotoxic agents ; however , the function of this hyperactivation has not been adequately explained . Here , we examine PAR synthesis in mouse fibroblasts deficient in the base excision repair enzyme DNA polymerase \u03b2 ( pol \u03b2 ) . The extent and duration of PARP-1 activation was measured after exposure to either the DNA alkylating agent , methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) , or to low energy laser-induced DNA damage . There was strong DNA damage-induced hyperactivation of PARP-1 in pol \u03b2 nullcells , but not in wild-type cells . In the case of MMS treatment , PAR synthesis did not lead to cell death in the pol \u03b2 null cells , but instead resulted in increased PARylation of the nonhomologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) protein Ku70 and increased association of Ku70 with PARP-1 . Inhibition of the NHEJ factor DNA-PK , under conditions of MMS-induced PARP-1 hyperactivation , enhanced necrotic cell death . These data suggest that PARP-1 hyperactivation is a protective mechanism triggering the classical-NHEJ DNA repair pathway when the primary alkylated base damage repair pathway is compromised .
The DNA repair protein Ku70 is a key player in chemoresistance to anticancer agents ( e.g. , etoposide ) or radioresistance . The responses of different organs to radiation vary widely and likely depend on the cell population in the organs . Previously , we established and characterized Ku70-deficient murine lung epithelial ( Ku70 -/- MLE ) cells and found that these cells are more sensitive than Ku70 +/- MLE cells ( control cells ) to X-irradiation , as determined by clonogenic survival assay ; however , the mechanism underlying this sensitivity remains unclear . In this study , we examined the mechanism by which X-irradiation triggers the death of Ku70 -/- MLE cells . Our results showed that Ku70 -/- MLE cells were more sensitive to radiation-induced apoptosis than control cells , although X-irradiation activated caspase-3 and caspase-7 , and cleaved PARP in both cell lines . We also examined the expression level of phosphorylated H2AX ( \u03b3H2AX ) , which is a marker of DSB , and observed the phosphorylation of H2AX and the elimination of \u03b3H2AX in both cell lines after X-irradiation . The elimination in Ku70 -/- MLE cells was slower than that in control cells , suggesting that DSB repair activity in the Ku70 -/- MLE cells is lower than that in control cells . These findings suggest that Ku70 might play a key role in the inhibition of apoptosis through the DSB repair pathway in lung epithelial cells . Our findings also suggest that these cell lines might be useful for the study of Ku70 functions and the Ku70-dependent DSB repair pathway in lung epithelial cells .
The main feedback loop driving circadian rhythm in mice is controlled , in part , by the genes encoding the cryptochromes Cry1 and Cry2 . Targeted mutation of both Cry1 and Cry2 delay the early onset of tumor formation in p53-null mutant mice . Furthermore , Ras-transformed p53- and Cry-null mouse skin fibroblasts are more sensitive than p53 mutants to apoptotic cell death initiated by agents that activate either the intrinsic or the extrinsic apoptosis pathways . Here , we investigated the effect of Cry1 and Cry2 mutations on cell death by other genotoxic agents that generate alkylated bases , interstrand crosslinks , DNA-protein crosslinks , and double-strand breaks . Both ultraviolet ( UV ) and the UV mimetic compound oxaliplatin and the radiomimetic compound doxorubicin promoted apoptosis by upregulating the tumor suppressor p73 . However , only the UV and oxaliplatin-induced upregulation of p73 mediated by the transcription factor Egr1 , but not the doxorubicin-induced upregulation mediated by the transcription factor E2F1 , was enhanced by Cry1/Cry2 double mutation . Accordingly , Egr1 downregulation reduced oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis , whereas E2F1 downregulation reduced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis . Our findings establish distinct roles for cryptochromes in intrinsic apoptosis induced by UV mimetic and radiomimetic agents .
Ophiopogonin B ( OP-B ) is a bioactive component of Radix Ophiopogon Japonicus , which is often used in Chinese traditional medicine to treat pulmonary disease . However , whether or not OP-B has any potential antitumor activity has not been reported . Here , we show that the non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell lines NCI-H157 and NCI-H460 treated with OP-B grow more slowly and accumulate vacuoles in their cytoplasm compared to untreated control cells . Flow cytometric analysis showed that the cells were arrested in G0/G1 phase . Nuclear morphology , Annexin-V/PI staining , and expression of cleaved caspase-3 all confirm that OP-B does not induce apoptosis . Instead , based on results from both transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II ( LC3-II ) , we determined that OP-B treatment induced autophagy in both cell lines . Next , we examined the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and found that OP-B inhibited phosphorylation of Akt(Ser473 , Thr308 ) in NCI-H157 cells and also inhibited several key components of the pathway in NCI-H460 cells , such as p-Akt(Ser473 , Thr308 ) , p-p70S6K ( Thr389 ) . Additionally , insulin-mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway provides evidence that activation of this pathway may correlate with induction of autophagy in H460 cells . Therefore , OP-B is a prospective inhibitor of PI3K/Akt and may be used as an alternative compound to treat NSCLC .
Adhesion to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is critical for epithelial tissue homeostasis and function . ECM detachment induces metabolic stress and programmed cell death via anoikis . ECM-detached mammary epithelial cells are able to rapidly activate autophagy allowing for survival and an opportunity for re-attachment . However , the mechanisms controlling detachment-induced autophagy remain unclear . Here we uncover that the kinase PERK rapidly promotes autophagy in ECM-detached cells by activating AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , resulting in downstream inhibition of mTORC1-p70(S6K) signaling . LKB1 and TSC2 , but not TSC1 , are required for PERK-mediated inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycinin MCF10A cells and mouse embryo fibroblast cells . Importantly , this pathway shows fast kinetics , is transcription-independent and is exclusively activated during ECM detachment , but not by canonical endoplasmic reticulum stressors . Moreover , enforced PERK or AMPK activation upregulates autophagy and causes luminal filling during acinar morphogenesis by perpetuating a population of surviving autophagic luminal cells that resist anoikis . Hence , we identify a novel pathway in which suspension-activated PERK promotes the activation of LKB1 , AMPK and TSC2 , leading to the rapid induction of detachment-induced autophagy . We propose that increased autophagy , secondary to persistent PERK and LKB1-AMPK signaling , can robustly protect cells from anoikis and promote luminal filling during early carcinoma progression.Oncogene advance online publication , 19 November 2012 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.512 .
The vacuolar H+-ATPase ( V-ATPase ) , a multisubunit proton pump , has come into focus as an attractive target in cancer invasion . However little is known about the role of V-ATPase in cell death and especially the underlying mechanisms remain mostly unknown . We used the myxobacterial macrolide archazolid B , a potent inhibitor of the V-ATPase , as an experimental drug as well as a chemical tool to decipher V-ATPase related cell death signaling . We found that archazolid induced apoptosis in highly invasive tumor cells at nanomolar concentrations which was executed by the mitochondrial pathway . Prior to apoptosis induction archazolid lead to the activation of a cellular stress response including activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha ( HIF1alpha ) and autophagy . Autophagy was induced at low concentrations of archazolid that do not alter pH in lysosomes and was shown by degradation of p62 or fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes . HIF1alpha was induced due to energy stress shown by a decline of the ATP level and followed by a shut down of energy consuming processes . As silencing HIF1alpha increases apoptosis , the cellular stress response was suggested to be a survival mechanism . We conclude that archazolid leads to energy stress which activates adaptive mechanisms like autophagy mediated by HIF1alpha and finally leads to apoptosis . We propose V-ATPase as a promising drugable target in cancer therapy caught up at the interplay of apoptosis , autophagy and cellular/metabolic stress .
The omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , elicit antiproliferative effects in cancer cell lines and in animal models . Dietary DHA and EPA can be converted to their ethanolamine derivatives , docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine ( DHEA ) and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine ( EPEA ) , respectively ; however , few studies are reported on their anticancer activities . Here , we demonstrated that DHEA and EPEA were able to reduce cell viability in MCF-7 breast cancer cells whereas they did not elicit any effects in MCF-10A non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells . Since DHA and EPA are ligands of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor ( PPAR ) gamma , we sought to determine whether PPARgamma may also mediate DHEA and EPEA actions . In MCF-7 cells , both compounds enhanced PPARgamma expression , stimulated a PPAR response element-dependent transcription as confirmed by the increased expression of its target gene PTEN , resulting in the inhibition of AKT-mTOR pathways . Besides , DHEA and EPEA treatment induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 promoting its dissociation from beclin-1 which resulted in autophagy induction . We also observed an increase of beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 expression along with an enhanced autophagosomes formation as revealed by mono-dansyl-cadaverine staining . Finally , we demonstrated the involvement of PPARgamma in DHEA- and EPEA-induced autophagy by using siRNA technology and a selective inhibitor . In summary , our data show that the two omega-3 ethanolamines exert antiproliferative effects by inducing autophagy in breast cancer cells highlighting their potential use as breast cancer preventive and/or therapeutic agents .

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease at both the clinical and molecular levels . This heterogeneity may give rise to different therapy responses . Molecular profiling has facilitated identification of signatures for stratifying patients who would potentially benefit from given therapies . Previously , we reported on a subset of genes with the potential for predicting response of primary breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Herein , we report that patients with luminal ( estrogen receptor alpha [ ERalpha]-expressing ) breast cancer were enriched for nonresponders . To identify novel factors that contribute to the survival of breast cancer cells , a loss-of-function screen was performed with a subset of genes overexpressed in patients with disease resistant to chemotherapy . This approach led us to identify protein phosphatase 1 , regulatory subunit 15B ( PPP1R15B ) as a factor with a potentially essential role in the survival of ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells . Functional analyses showed that PPP1R15B depletion results in impaired proliferation due to unsuccessful transition of cells from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle , and apoptosis induction . Moreover , our data revealed a regulatory role for PPP1R15B in activating ERalpha . Furthermore , a high level of PPP1R15B mRNA expression was associated with poor outcome following tamoxifen-based therapy . Accordingly , knockdown of PPP1R15B expression sensitized tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells to tamoxifen while reducing ERalpha abundance in these cells . Our findings reveal a novel role for PPP1R15B in the survival and therapy response of ERalpha-positive breast cancer and may open new avenues for tumor subtype-specific therapeutic strategies in the era of personalized medicine .
Necrotic cells are known to activate the innate immune system and trigger inflammation by releasing damage associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ) . However , how necrotic cells influence the induction of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell-mediated adaptive immune responses under sterile conditions , in the absence of pathogen associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) , remains poorly understood . Here , we examined antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses to primary sterile necrotic tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo . We found that primary necrotic cells alone fail to generate CD8(+) T cell-dependent immune responses toward cell-associated antigens . We show that necrotic cells trigger CD8(+) T-cell immunity only in the presence of PAMPs or analogs , such as p(dI-dC) and/or unmethylated CpG DNA . The electroporation of tumor cells with these PAMPs prior to necrosis induction triggered antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses through a TLR9/MyD88-dependent pathway . In addition , we found that necrotic cells contain factors that can block the cross-priming of CD8(+) T cells even under non-sterile conditions and can serve as a possible mechanism of immunosuppression . These results suggest that antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses to primary necrotic tumor cells can be induced in the presence of PAMPs and thus have a substantial impact on the development of antitumor vaccination strategies .
Benzyl isothiocyanate ( BITC ) is a dietary chemopreventive agent that inhibits the growth of various human cancer cells by causing apoptotic cell death . In this study , we demonstrate that BITC not only induces apoptosis but also induces autophagy in human hormone-sensitive ( Rv1 ) and -refractory ( PC3 ) prostate cancer cells . In BITC-treated cells , the induction of autophagy was detected by monitoring the processing of an autophagy marker protein , microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 ( LC3 ) , the aggregation of LC3 into granular structures and the formation of acidic organelles . Inhibition of autophagy using 3-methyladenine increased BITC-induced apoptosis , whereas the administration of caspase inhibitor suppressed BITC-induced cell death . Our data also showed that BITC inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner . The expression of phospho-mTOR ( Ser2481 ) , an indicator of mTOR intrinsic catalytic activity , and phospho-UNC-51-like kinase 1 ( Ser757 ) , a direct substrate of mTOR , were decreased in BITC-treated cells . However , the increased expression of phospho-mTOR ( Ser2448 ) , phospho-AKT ( Ser473 ) and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 were detected only in PC3 cells at later stages of BITC treatment . Collectively , our results show that BITC induces a protective autophagy response in Rv1 and PC3 cells through inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway . Activation of the AKT survival pathway was only observed in PC3 cells , representing a resistance mechanism of advanced prostate cancer upon BITC treatment . These findings could potentially contribute to the beneficial effect of BITC in prostate cancer treatments .
PURPOSE : Previous studies have shown that the novel microtubule poison , JG-03-14 , which binds to the colchicine binding site of tubulin , has the capacity to kill breast tumor cells primarily through the promotion of autophagy . The current work was designed to determine whether autophagy was , in fact , the primary mode of action as well as susceptibility to JG-03-14 in two additional tumor cell models , the B16/F10 murine melanoma cell line and the HCT-116 human colon cancer cell line . METHODS : Drug cytotoxicity was monitored based on viable cell number and clonogenic survival . Apoptosis was assessed by DAPI staining , the TUNEL assay and/or FACS analysis . Autophagy was monitored based on staining with acridine orange , redistribution and punctuation of RFP-LC3 and electron microscopy as well as p62 degradation . Senescence was evaluated based on beta-galactosidase staining and alterations in cell morphology . Drug effects were also evaluated in a murine model of B16/F10 cells that localizes to the lungs while peripheral neuropathy was assessed by three complementary behavioral assays . RESULTS : Both HCT-116 colon cancer cells and B16/F10 melanoma cells were sensitive to JG-03-14 in that the drug demonstrated tumor cell killing . However , there was minimal induction of apoptosis . In contrast , there was clear evidence for autophagy and autophagic flux while the residual surviving cells appeared to be in a state of irreversible senescence . Inhibition of drug-induced autophagy in either the melanoma cells or the colon carcinoma cells was only slightly protective as the cells instead died by apoptosis . JG-03-14 reduced the size of tumor nodules in mice lungs ; furthermore , the drug did not promote peripheral neuropathy . CONCLUSIONS : Taken together with evidence for its actions as a vascular disrupting agent , these observations support the potential utility of JG-03-14 to effectively treat malignancies that might be resistant to conventional chemotherapy through evasion of apoptosis .
Arginine deprivation is a promising strategy for treating ASS-negative malignant tumors including melanoma . However , autophagy can potentially counteract the effectiveness of this treatment by acting as a pro-survival pathway . By combining tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) with arginine deprivation using ADI-PEG20 ( pegylated arginine deiminase ) , we achieved enhanced apoptosis and accelerated cell death in melanoma cell lines . This implies a switch from autophagy to apoptosis . In our current investigation , we found that TRAIL could induce the cleavage of two key autophagic proteins , Beclin-1 and Atg5 , in the combination treatment . Using specific inhibitors for individual caspases , we found that caspase-8 inhibitor could completely abolish the cleavage . Furthermore , caspase-8 inhibitor was able to fully reverse the enhanced cytotoxicity induced by TRAIL . Inhibitors for caspase-3 , 6 , 9 , and 10 were able to block the cleavage of these two autophagic proteins to some extent and correspondingly rescue cells from the cytotoxicity of the combination of TRAIL and arginine deprivation . In contrast , calpain inhibitor could not prevent the cleavage of either Beclin-1 or Atg5 , and was unable to prevent cell death . Overall , our data indicate that the cleavage of Beclin-1 and Atg5 by TRAIL-initiated caspase activation is one of the mechanisms that lead to the enhancement of the cytotoxicity in the combination treatment .
Ursolic acid ( UA ) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid with promising cancer chemopreventive properties . A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying anticancer activity of UA is needed for further development as a clinically useful chemopreventive agent . Here , we found that both endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress and autophagy were induced by UA in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells . Surprisingly , ER stress was identified as an effect rather than a cause of UA-induced autophagy . Autophagy-dependent ER stress protected the cells from UA-induced apoptosis through EIF2AK3-mediated upregulation of MCL1 . Activation of MAPK1/3 but not inhibition of MTOR pathway contributed to UA-induced cytoprotective autophagy in MCF-7 cells . Our findings uncovered a novel cellular mechanism involved in the anticancer activity of UA , and also provided a useful model to study biological significance and mechanisms of autophagy-mediated ER stress .
Endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress induces both autophagy and apoptosis yet the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying the regulation of these two cellular processes in cells undergoing ER stress remain less clear . We report here that eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase ( EEF2K ) is a critical controller of the ER stress-induced autophagy and apoptosis in tumor cells . DDIT4 , a stress-induced protein , was required for transducing the signal for activation of EEF2K under ER stress . We further showed that phosphorylation of EEF2K at Ser398 was essential for induction of autophagy , while phosphorylation of the kinase at Ser366 and Ser78 exerted an inhibitory effect on autophagy . Suppression of the ER stress-activated autophagy via silencing of EEF2K aggravated ER stress and promoted apoptotic cell death in tumor cells . Moreover , inhibiting EEF2K by either RNAi or NH125 , a small molecule inhibitor of the enzyme , rendered tumor cells more sensitive to curcumin and velcade , two anticancer agents that possess ER stress-inducing action . Our study indicated that the DDIT4-EEF2K pathway was essential for inducing autophagy and for determining the fate of tumor cells under ER stress , and suggested that inhibiting the EEF2K-mediated autophagy can deteriorate ER stress and lead to a greater apoptotic response , thereby potentiating the efficacy of the ER stress-inducing agents against cancer .
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) is a prototype of mutant KIT oncogene-driven tumor . Prolonged tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) treatment may result in a resistant phenotype through acquired secondary KIT mutation . Heat shock protein 90 ( HSP90AA1 ) is a chaperone protein responsible for protein maturation and stability , and KIT is a known client protein of HSP90AA1 . Inhibition of HSP90AA1 has been shown to destabilize KIT protein by enhancing its degradation via the proteasome-dependent pathway . In this study , we demonstrated that NVP-AUY922 ( AUY922 ) , a new class of HSP90AA1 inhibitor , is effective in inhibiting the growth of GIST cells expressing mutant KIT protein , the imatinib-sensitive GIST882 and imatinib-resistant GIST48 cells . The growth inhibition was accompanied with a sustained reduction of both total and phosphorylated KIT proteins and the induction of apoptosis in both cell lines . Surprisingly , AUY922-induced KIT reduction could be partially reversed by pharmacological inhibition of either autophagy or proteasome degradation pathway . The blockade of autophagy alone led to the accumulation of the KIT protein , highlighting the role of autophagy in endogenous KIT turnover . The involvement of autophagy in endogenous and AUY922-induced KIT protein turnover was further confirmed by the colocalization of KIT with MAP1LC3B- , acridine orange- or SQSTM1-labeled autophagosome , and by the accumulation of KIT in GIST cells by silencing either BECN1 or ATG5 to disrupt autophagosome activity . Therefore , the results not only highlight the potential application of AUY922 for the treatment of KIT-expressing GISTs , but also provide the first evidence for the involvement of autophagy in endogenous and HSP90AA1 inhibitor-induced KIT degradation .
Autophagy , or autophagocytosis , is a selective intracellular degradative process involving the cell's own lysosomal apparatus . An essential component in cell development , homeostasis , repair and resistance to stress , autophagy may result in either cell death or survival . The targeted region of the cell is sequestered within a membrane structure , the autophagosome , for regulation of the catabolic process . A key factor in both autophagosome formation and autophagosome maturation is a protein encoded by the ultraviolet irradiation resistance-associated gene ( UVRAG ) . Conversely , the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase B ( PKB , also known as Akt ) , which regulates survival in various cancers , inhibits autophagy through mTOR activation . We found that Akt1 may also directly inhibit autophagy by down-regulating UVRAG both in a 293T transient transfection system and breast cancer cells stably expressing Akt1 . The UVRAG with mutations at putative Akt1-phosphorylation sites were still inhibited by Akt1 , and dominant-negative Akt1 also inhibited UVRAG expression , suggesting that Akt1 down-regulates UVRAG by a kinase activity-independent mechanism . We showed that Akt1 overexpression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells down-regulated UVRAG transcription . Cells over-expressing Akt1 were more resistant than control cells to ultraviolet light-induced autophagy and exhibited the associated reduction in cell viability . Levels of the autophagosome indicator protein LC3B-II and mRFP-GFP-LC3 were reduced in cells that over-expressing Akt1 . Inhibiting Akt1 by siRNA or reintroducing UVRAG gene rescued the level of LC3B-II in UV-irradiation . Altogether , these data suggest that Akt1 may inhibit autophagy by decreasing UVRAG expression , which also sensitizes cancer cells to UV irradiation .
K-Ras dependent non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells are ' addicted ' to basal autophagy that reprograms cellular metabolism in a lysosomal-sensitive manner . Here we demonstrate that the xenophagy-associated kinase TBK1 drives basal autophagy , consistent with its known requirement in K-Ras-dependent NSCLC proliferation . Furthermore , basal autophagy in this context is characterised by sequestration of the xenophagy cargo receptor Ndp52 and its paralogue Tax1bp1 , which we demonstrate here to be a bona fide cargo receptor . Autophagy of these cargo receptors promotes non-canonical NF-kappaB signalling . We propose that this TBK1-dependent mechanism for NF-kappaB signalling contributes to autophagy addiction in K-Ras driven NSCLC .
The glutathione peroxidases , a family of selenocysteine-containing redox enzymes , play pivotal roles in balancing the signaling , immunomodulatory , and deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . The glutathione peroxidase GPX3 is the only extracellular member of this family , suggesting it may defend cells against ROS in the extracellular environment . Notably , GPX3 hypermethylation and underexpression occur commonly in prostate , gastric , cervical , thyroid , and colon cancers . We took a reverse genetics approach to investigate whether GPX3 would augment inflammatory colonic tumorigenesis , a process characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation , comparing Gpx3(-/-) mice in an established two-stage model of inflammatory colon carcinogenesis . Gpx3-deficient mice exhibited an increased tumor number , though not size , along with a higher degree of dysplasia . In addition , they exhibited increased inflammation with redistribution toward protumorigenic M2 macrophage subsets , increased proliferation , hyperactive WNT signaling , and increased DNA damage . To determine the impact of acute gene loss in an established colon cancer line , we silenced GPX3 in human Caco2 cells , resulting in increased ROS production , DNA damage and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress , combined with decreased contact-independent growth . Taken together , our results suggested an immunomodulatory role for GPX3 that limits the development of colitis-associated carcinoma .
Oxaliplatin is included in a number of effective combination regimens used as first and subsequent lines of therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer . Accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy plays a significant role in response to cancer therapy . However , the role of autophagy in oxaliplatin-induced cell death remains to be clarified . In this study , we showed that oxaliplatin induced cell death and autophagy in Caco-2 colorectal cancer cells . The suppression of autophagy using either pharmacologic inhibitors ( 3-methyladenine , bafilomycin A1 ) or RNA interference in essential autophagy genes ( ATG5 or Beclin1 ) enhanced the cell death and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production induced by oxaliplatin in Caco-2 cells . Blocking oxaliplatin-induced ROS production by using ROS scavengers ( NAC or Tiron ) decreased autophagy . Furthermore , numerous dilated endoplasmic reticula ( ER ) were present in oxaliplatin-treated Caco-2 cells , and blocking ER stress by RNA interference against candidate of metastasis-1 ( P8 ) and C/EBP-homologous protein ( CHOP ) decreased autophagy and ROS production . Taken together , these data indicate that oxaliplatin activates autophagy as a cytoprotective response via ER stress and ROS in human colorectal cancer cells .
The prediction of tumor behavior for patients with oral carcinomas remains a challenge for clinicians . The presence of lymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor but it is limited in predicting local relapse or survival . This highlights the need for identifying biomarkers that may effectively contribute to prediction of recurrence and tumor spread . In this study , we used one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis , mass spectrometry and immunodetection methods to analyze protein expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas . Using a refinement for classifying oral carcinomas in regard to prognosis , we analyzed small but lymph node metastasis-positive versus large , lymph node metastasis-negative tumors in order to contribute to the molecular characterization of subgroups with risk of dissemination . Specific protein patterns favoring metastasis were observed in the " more-aggressive " group defined by the present study . This group displayed upregulation of proteins involved in migration , adhesion , angiogenesis , cell cycle regulation , anti-apoptosis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition , whereas the " less-aggressive " group was engaged in keratinocyte differentiation , epidermis development , inflammation and immune response . Besides the identification of several proteins not yet described as deregulated in oral carcinomas , the present study demonstrated for the first time the role of cofilin-1 in modulating cell invasion in oral carcinomas .
Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved , multi-step lysosomal degradation process in which a cell degrades its own long-lived proteins and damaged organelles . Ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) has recently been shown to upregulate the process of autophagy . Previous studies showed that certain microRNAs , including miR-18a , potentially regulate ATM in cancer cells . However , the mechanisms behind the modulation of ATM by miR-18a remain to be elucidated in colon cancer cells . In the present study , we explored the impact of miR-18a on the autophagy process and ATM expression in HCT116 colon cancer cells . To determine whether a preliminary link exists between autophagy and miR-18a , HCT116 cells were irradiated and quantitative ( q ) PCR was performed to measure miR-18a expression . HCT116 cells were transfected with an miR-18a mimic to study its impact on indicators of autophagy . Western blotting and luciferase assays were implemented to explore the impact of miR-18a on ATM gene expression in HCT116 cells . The results showed that miR-18a expression was strongly stimulated by radiation . Ectopic overexpression of miR-18a in HCT116 cell lines potently enhanced autophagy and ionizing radiation-induced autophagy . Moreover , miR-18a overexpression led to the upregulation of ATM expression and suppression of mTORC1 activity . Results of the present study pertaining to the role of miR-18a in regulating autophagy and ATM gene expression in colon cancer cells revealed a novel function for miR-18a in a critical cellular event and on a crucial gene with significant impacts in cancer development , progression , treatment and in other diseases .
BACKGROUND Treatment of head and neck cancer with radiation often results in damage to surrounding normal tissues such as salivary glands . Permanent loss of function in the salivary glands often leads patients to discontinue treatment due to incapacitating side effects . It has previously been shown that IGF-1 suppresses radiation-induced apoptosis and enhances G2/M arrest leading to preservation of salivary gland function . In an effort to recapitulate the effects of IGF-1 , as well as increase the likelihood of translating these findings to the clinic , the small molecule therapeutic Roscovitine , is being tested . Roscovitine is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that acts to transiently inhibit cell cycle progression and allow for DNA repair in damaged tissues . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Treatment with Roscovitine prior to irradiation induced a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G(2)/M phase , as demonstrated by flow cytometry . In contrast , mice treated with radiation exhibit no differences in the percentage of cells in G(2)/M when compared to unirradiated controls . Similar to previous studies utilizing IGF-1 , pretreatment with Roscovitine leads to a significant up-regulation of p21 expression and a significant decrease in the number of PCNA positive cells . Radiation treatment leads to a significant increase in activated caspase-3 positive salivary acinar cells , which is suppressed by pretreatment with Roscovitine . Administration of Roscovitine prior to targeted head and neck irradiation preserves normal tissue function in mouse parotid salivary glands , both acutely and chronically , as measured by salivary output . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These studies suggest that induction of transient G(2)/M cell cycle arrest by Roscovitine allows for suppression of apoptosis , thus preserving normal salivary function following targeted head and neck irradiation . This could have an important clinical impact by preventing the negative side effects of radiation therapy in surrounding normal tissues .
BACKGROUND : The p38alpha MAP kinase pathway is involved in inflammation , cell differentiation , growth , apoptosis and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta . The overproduction of these cytokines plays an important role in cancer . The aim of this work was to design a peptide inhibitor on the basis of structural information of the active site of p38alpha . METHODS : A tetrapeptide , VWCS as p38alpha inhibitor was designed on the basis of structural information of the ATP binding site by molecular modeling . The inhibition study of peptide with p38alpha was performed by ELISA , binding study by Surface Plasmon Resonance and anti-proliferative assays by MTT and flow cytometry . RESULTS : The percentage inhibition of designed VWCS against pure p38alpha protein and serum of HNSCC patients was 70.30 and 71.5% , respectively . The biochemical assay demonstrated the K(D) and IC(50) of the selective peptide as 7.22<FFFD>10(-9)M and 20.08nM , respectively . The VWCS as inhibitor significantly reduced viability of oral cancer KB cell line with an IC(50) value of 10muM and induced apoptosis by activating Caspase 3 and 7 . CONCLUSIONS : VWCS efficiently interacted at the ATP binding pocket of p38alpha with high potency and can be used as a potent inhibitor in case of HNSCC . GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE : VWCS can act as an anticancer agent as it potentially inhibits the cell growth and induces apoptosis in oral cancer cell-line in a dose as well as time dependent manner . Hence , p38alpha MAP kinase inhibitor can be a potential therapeutic agent for human oral cancer .
Calcium ( Ca(2+) ) signals are involved in important checkpoints in cell death pathways and promote both apoptosis and autophagy . However , the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis in response to Ca(2+) level elevation is poorly understood . Here , we provided evidence that the influx of extracellular Ca(2+) triggered by Trichokonin VI ( TK VI ) , an antimicrobial peptide , induced calpain-dependent apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells . Remarkably , TK VI preferentially induced apoptosis that was associated with calpain-mediated Bax and Atg5 cleavage , which resulted in the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release . Interestingly , truncated , but not full-length Atg5 , associated with Bcl-xL and promoted the intrinsic pathway . Moreover , TK VI treatment induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) accumulation , an effect in which Bak might play a major role . This accumulation of ROS resulted in the subsequent disposal of damaged mitochondria within autophagosomes via Atg5-mediated and mitochondria-selective autophagy . Both the inhibition of calpain activity and Bax deficiency activated a switch that promoted an enhancement of autophagy . The inhibition of both apoptosis and autophagy significantly attenuated the TK VI cytotoxicity , indicating that the two processes had stimulatory effects during TK VI-meditated cell death . These results suggested that calpain , Bak and Atg5 were molecular links between autophagy and apoptosis and revealed novel aspects of the crosstalk between these two processes . The potential of TK VI is proposed as a promising anticancer agent for its well-characterized activity of Ca(2+) agonist and as a possible novel therapeutic strategy that acts on cancer cell mitochondria .
ABSTRACT : PurposeAutophagy has attracted attentions as a novel mechanism for tumor development . In this study Human ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3 and multidrug-resistant phenotype SKVCR cells were used and the roles of autophagy in radiation-induced cell death were analyzed.Methods and materialsCell viability was examined by colony formation and cell counting kit-8 ( CCK-8 ) assay , 3MA and ZVAD were used to block autophagy and apoptosis , respectively . Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect mRNA level and Western blot was used to detect protein expression , monodansylcadaverine ( MDC ) staining and flow cytometery were used for autophagy , apoptosis and cell cycle dynamics , respectively . RESULTS : ( 1 ) The radiosensitivity exhibited differently in SKOV3 and SKVCR cells ( SKOV3 : D0=3.37 , SKVCR : D0= 4.18 ) ; compared with SKOV3 the constitutive expression of MAPLC3 in SKVCR was higher , but no change of Caspase-3 and cleaved Caspase-3 . ( 2 ) The ionizing radiation ( IR)- induced apoptosis and autophagy were significant in both cells ( P<0.05 ) ; inhibition of apoptosis with ZVAD showed no impact on survival of SKOV3 and SKVCR cells after radiation , while inhibition of autophagy significantly decreased viability in SKVCR cells , for SKVO3 cells only low level of radiation ( 2 Gy and 4 Gy ) could decrease the viability(P<0.05) . ( 3 ) ZVAD inhibited apoptosis and autophagy in both cells , 3MA inhibit apoptosis in SKOV3 , and promote apoptosis in SKVCR , together with inhibition of autophagy . ( 4 ) G2/M arrest was induced by radiation in both cells ; the accumulation of G2/M was more significant in SKOV3 , 3MA attenuated the radiation-induced S phase delay in SKVCR . CONCLUSION : IR-induced autophagy provides a self-protective mechanism against radiotherapy in SKVCR cells , the use of autophagy inhibitor , 3MA , increases the killing effects of radiation by inhibiting autophagy and radiation- induced S phase delay , also by the increase of apoptosis , which suggests a better therapeutic strategy in drug- resistant SKVCR ovarian cancer cells .
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects and molecular mechanisms of everolimus on Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells . Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells were treated with everolimus ( 10 mug/ml ) at selected time points ( 6 , 12 and 24 h ) . Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT and flow cytometric analyses . The glycolytic activity was determined by measuring the activity of the key enzyme lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) and lactate production . The activity of mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling was measured by western blotting . The expression of genes , including hexokinase 2 ( HK2 ) and microRNA-143 ( miR-143 ) , was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . The administration of everolimus time-dependently inhibited proliferation and glycolysis and induced apoptosis in the Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells . As the time of treatment with everolimus increased , the mTOR signaling activity decreased , indicated by lower phosphorylation levels of S6 kinase ; however , the phosphorylation levels of mTOR barely changed . Moreover , our data showed an everolimus-induced increase in miR-143 and decrease in HK2 in Panc-1 cells in a time-dependent manner . In conclusion , the current study indicates a novel role of everolimus in its antitumor effect as an inhibitor of glycolysis in Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells . Furthermore , our data highlights the significance of exploring the mechanisms of everolimus and miR-143 in malignant tumors .
Breast cancer incidence is increased in women receiving menopausal hormone therapy with estrogen plus progestin but not with estrogen alone . The use of a tissue-selective estrogen complex ( TSEC ) has been proposed as a novel menopausal hormone therapy strategy to eliminate the requirement for a progestogen . Combination of bazedoxifene ( BZA ) with conjugated estrogens ( CEs ) , the first TSEC , has shown beneficial effects . Whether it would exert antiestrogenic effects on breast cancer is not clear . To address this issue , we compared estradiol ( E(2) ) and CE alone on proliferation and apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells . CE stimulated growth of MCF-7 cells at a peak concentration 10-fold higher than required for E(2) . Both CE and E(2) alone increased DNA synthesis and reduced apoptosis with activation of MAPK , Akt , and p70S6K and up-regulation of antiapoptotic factors survivin , Bcl-2 , and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein , These effects could be completely blocked by BZA . Gene expression studies demonstrated that CE and E(2) were equally potent on expression of cMyc , pS2 , and WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 2 , whereas the stimulatory effects of CE on progesterone receptor and amphiregulin expression were weaker than E(2) . BZA effectively blocked each of these effects and showed no estrogen agonistic effects when used alone . Our results indicate that the stimulatory effects of E(2) or CE on breast cancer cells could be completely abrogated by BZA . These studies imply that the CE/BZA , TSEC , exerts antiestrogenic effects on breast cancer cells and might block the growth of occult breast neoplasms in postmenopausal women , resulting in an overall reduction in tumor incidence .
Gliomas display anoikis resistance , enhanced invasion in to the adjacent brain parenchyma and eventually recur despite using the standard therapies . Our studies on increased anoikis sensitization in matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2)-knockdown 4910 and 5310 human glioma xenograft cells were interestingly correlated with p21-activated kinase 4 ( PAK4 ) inhibition , prompting us to further investigate the role of PAK4 in glioma . Here , we report the PAK4 upregulation in positive correlation with increasing glioma pathological grades . The siRNA-mediated PAK4 knockdown elevated anoikis , and inhibited invasion and migration by downregulating MMP-2 , alphavbeta3-integrin and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor ( phospho-EGFR ) . The cDNA-PCR arrays revealed a transcriptional suppression of essential proteins involved in cell proliferation and adhesion in PAK4-knockdown cells . Most importantly , glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated the MMP-2 as a new PAK4-interacting protein which binds to PAK4 kinase domain . Individual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor and alphavbeta3 antibody treatments in PAK4si-treated cells indicated the regulation of alphavbeta3/EGFR survival signaling by PAK4 . Overexpression of PAK4 significantly reversed the MMP2si-induced cell death in both cell lines . Codepletion of PAK4 and MMP-2 resulted in robust anoikis-mediated cell death , and severely inhibited invasive and migratory properties in these cells . PAK4si inhibited in vivo tumor growth in nude mice by inhibiting MMP-2 , beta3-integrin and phospho-EGFR levels in tumors . Our findings indicate a physical association between PAK4 and MMP-2 , and suggest the future therapeutic potential of PAK4/MMP-2 dual targeting in glioma treatment .
Aurora A kinase has drawn considerable attention as a therapeutic target for cancer therapy . However , the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of the anticancer effects of Aurora A kinase inhibition are still not fully understood . Herein , we show that depletion of Aurora A kinase by RNA interference ( RNAi ) in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells upregulated FoxO1 in a p53-dependent manner , which induces cell cycle arrest . Introduction of an RNAi-resistant Aurora A kinase into Aurora A-knockdown cells resulted in downregulation of FoxO1 expression and rescued proliferation . In addition , silencing of FoxO1 in Aurora A-knockdown cells allowed the cells to exit cytostatic arrest , which , in turn , led to massive cell death . Our results suggest that FoxO1 is responsible for growth arrest at the G 2/M phase that is induced by Aurora A kinase inhibition .
It is now largely accepted that ribosomal proteins may be implicated in a variety of biological functions besides that of components of the translation machinery . Many evidences show that a subset of ribosomal proteins are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis through modulation of p53 activity . In addition , p53-independent mechanisms of cell cycle arrest in response to alterations of ribosomal proteins availability have been described . Here , we identify human rpL3 as a new regulator of cell cycle and apoptosis through positive regulation of p21 expression in a p53-independent system . We demonstrate that the rpL3-mediated p21 upregulation requires the specific interaction between rpL3 and Sp1 . Furthermore , in our experimental system , p21 overexpression leads to a dual outcome , activating the G\u2081/S arrest of the cell cycle or the apoptotic pathway through mitochondria , depending on its intracellular levels . It is noteworthy that depletion of p21 abrogates both effects . Taken together , our findings unravel a novel extraribosomal function of rpL3 and reinforce the proapoptotic role of p21 in addition to its widely reported ability as an inhibitor of cell proliferation .
cAMP-signaling plays an essential role in modulating the proliferation of different cell types , including cancer cells . Until now , the regulation of this pathway was restricted to the transmembrane class of adenylyl cyclases . In the present study , a significant overexpression of soluble adenylyl cyclase ( sAC ) , an alternative source of cAMP , was found in human prostate carcinoma and , therefore , the contribution of this cyclase was investigated in the prostate carcinoma cell lines LNCaP and PC3 . Suppression of sAC activity by treatment with the sAC-specific inhibitor KH7 or by sAC-specific knockdown mediated by siRNA or shRNA transfection prevented the proliferation of prostate carcinoma cells , led to lactate dehydrogenase release , and induced apoptosis . Cell cycle analysis revealed a significant rise in the G2-phase population 12 hours after sAC inhibition , which was accompanied by the down-regulation of cyclin B1 and CDK1. sAC-dependent regulation of proliferation involves the EPAC/Rap-1/B-Raf signaling pathway . In contrast , protein kinase A does not play a role . In conclusion , the present study suggests a novel sAC-dependent signaling pathway that controls the proliferation of prostate carcinoma cells .
Capsaicin , one of the major pungent ingredients found in red peppers , has been recently demonstrated to induce apoptosis in various malignant cell lines through an unclear mechanism . In this study , the effect of capsaicin on proliferation and apoptosis in the human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 and its possible mechanism(s) of action were investigated . The results of a Cell Counting Kit-8 ( CCK-8 ) assay revealed that capsaicin significantly decreased the viability of PANC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner . Capsaicin induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PANC-1 cells as demonstrated by a flow cytometric assessment . Caspase-3 expression at both the protein and mRNA level was promoted following capsaicin treatment . Furthermore , we revealed that phospho-PI3 Kinase p85 ( Tyr458 ) and phospho-Akt ( Ser473 ) in PANC-1 cells were downregulated in response to capsaicin . Moreover , capsaicin gavage significantly inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cell xenografts in athymic nude mice . An increased number of TUNEL-positive cells and cleaved caspase-3 were observed in capsaicin-treated mice . In vivo , capsaicin downregulated the expression of phospho-PI3 Kinase p85 ( Tyr458 ) and phospho-Akt ( Ser473 ) . In conclusion , we have demonstrated that capsaicin is an inhibitor of growth of PANC-1 cells , and downregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway may be involved in capsaicin-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo .
Cancer therapy with rapamycin has been successfully implemented for kidney cancer , glioblastoma and prostate cancer . However , there are few studies concerning the effects of rapamycin on the treatment of human melanoma . In this study , we investigated whether rapamycin may be a promising strategy for the effective treatment of melanoma and explored the possible mechanism for this by culturing M14 cells in vitro and treating with rapamycin at three concentrations ( 10 , 50 or 100 nmol/l ) . MDC and LC3B staining , western blot analysis , flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy were employed . We revealed that rapamycin induced autophagy and inhibited the proliferation of M14 cells in a concentration-dependent manner , Furthermore , western blot analysis revealed an upregulated expression of Bcl-2 and downregulated expression of Bax in M14 cells . In conclusion , rapamycin induced autophagy and inhibited the growth of M14 cells . The mechanism may involve regulation of the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins . Rapamycin appears to be a promising strategy for the effective treatment of melanoma .
Radix of Asiasarum heterotropoides var. mandshuricum F. Maekawa ( A. radix ) has been prescribed for treating pain , allergies and inflammatory disorders in traditional oriental medicine . However , only limited information on the anticancer effects of A. radix is currently available . The aim of this study was to determine the anticancer effect of the ethanol extract of A. radix ( EEAR ) on HCT-116 human colon cancer cells and to investigate its underlying mechanisms of action . EEAR significantly induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HCT-116 cells . EEAR-induced apoptosis was observed in parallel with activation of caspases and an increased ratio of Bax ( pro-apoptotic)/Bcl2 ( anti-apoptotic ) . Western blot analyses revealed that EEAR elevated the expression of p53 and p21(Waf/Cip1) and decreased the expression of the regulator proteins of G2/M phase progression , such as cdc2 and cyclin B. The upregulation of p53 by EEAR was due to the increased levels of p53 mRNA without a similar increase in proteasome-mediated p53 degradation . EEAR-induced apoptosis in HCT-116 cells was dependent on p53 expression , as determined by siRNA-mediated p53 knockdown . Taken together , these results suggest that EEAR inhibits the growth of the HCT-116 cells through induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis , which are mediated by p53 expression .
Acute leukemia is a disorder of the hematopoietic system characterized by the expansion of a clonal population of cells blocked from differentiating into mature cells . Recent studies have shown that chalcones and their derivatives induce apoptosis in different cell lines . Since new compounds with biological activity are needed , the aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of three synthetic chalcones , derived from 1-naphthaldehyde and 2-naphthaldehyde , on human acute myeloid leukemia K562 cells and on human acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells . Based on the results , the most cytotoxic compound ( A1 ) was chosen for further analysis in six human acute leukemia cells and in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line ( HT-29 ) . Chalcone A1 significantly reduced the cell viability of K562 , Jurkat , Kasumi , U937 , CEM and NB4 cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner when compared with the control group ( IC(50) values between ~1.5muM and 40muM ) . It was also cytotoxic to HL-29 cells . To further examine its effect on normal cells , peripheral blood lymphocytes collected from healthy volunteers were incubated with the compound . It has also been incubated with human fibroblasts cultured from bone marrow ( JMA ) . Chalcone A1 is non-cytotoxic to PBL cells and to JMA cells . A1 caused significant cell cycle arrest in all phases according to the cell line , and increased the proportion of cells in the sub G0/G1 phase . To evaluate whether this chalcone induced cell death via an apoptotic or necrotic pathway , cell morphology was examined using fluorescence microscopy . Cells treated with A1 at IC(50) demonstrated the morphological characteristic of apoptosis , such as chromatin condensation and formation of apoptotic bodies . Apoptosis was confirmed by externalization of phosphatidylserine , which was detected by the Annexin V-FITC method , and by DNA fragmentation . The results suggest that chalcone A1 has potential as a new lead compound for cancer therapy .
Metformin is a well-established diabetes drug that prevents the onset of most types of human cancers in diabetic patients , especially by targeting cancer stem cells . Metformin exerts its protective effects by functioning as a weak " mitochondrial poison, " as it acts as a complex I inhibitor and prevents oxidative mitochondrial metabolism ( OXPHOS ) . Thus , mitochondrial metabolism must play an essential role in promoting tumor growth . To determine the functional role of " mitochondrial health " in breast cancer pathogenesis , here we used mitochondrial uncoupling proteins ( UCPs ) to genetically induce mitochondrial dysfunction in either human breast cancer cells ( MDA-MB-231 ) or cancer-associated fibroblasts ( hTERT-BJ1 cells ) . Our results directly show that all three UCP family members ( UCP-1/2/3 ) induce autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in human breast cancer cells , which results in significant reductions in tumor growth . Conversely , induction of mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer-associated fibroblasts has just the opposite effect . More specifically , overexpression of UCP-1 in stromal fibroblasts increases beta-oxidation , ketone body production and the release of ATP-rich vesicles , which " fuels " tumor growth by providing high-energy nutrients in a paracrine fashion to epithelial cancer cells . Hence , the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction are truly compartment-specific . Thus , we conclude that the beneficial anticancer effects of mitochondrial inhibitors ( such as metformin ) may be attributed to the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction in the epithelial cancer cell compartment . Our studies identify cancer cell mitochondria as a clear target for drug discovery and for novel therapeutic interventions .
BACKGROUND Sorafenib has recently been shown to reduce tumour growth in hepatoblastoma ( HB ) xenografts . The effect of a combined administration with cytostatic agents was now investigated . METHODS Cell viability after treatment with sorafenib and different cytostatic agents was evaluated in two HB cell lines ( HUH6 and HepT1 ) using MTT assay . ERK signalling was investigated by western blot , NOXA expression by rt-PCR , and formation of DNA adducts using immunocytology . NMRI mice bearing subcutaneous HUH6-derived tumours were treated with sorafenib alone or in combination with cisplatin . Tumour progression , viability , apoptosis , and vascularisation were monitored by tumour volume , AFP levels , TUNEL assay , and CD31 immunostaining , respectively . RESULTS The combination of sorafenib and cisplatin led to a remarkable decrease in cell viability . The cisplatin-induced enhanced ERK1/2 activation , but not NOXA expression and the formation of DNA adducts was partly abrogated by sorafenib . In HB xenografts , both , sorafenib and alternated application of sorafenib and cisplatin significantly reduced tumour growth ( P<0.05 ) . Levels of AFP were lower in both treated groups ( P=0.08 ) . Relative apoptotic areas were increased ( P=0.003 ) . Mean vascular density was the lowest in the sorafenib/CDDP group ( P=0.02 ) . CONCLUSION The combination of sorafenib with cisplatin might be a promising treatment option for high risk or recurrent HB .
Background:Sorafenib is the only drug approved for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The bioenergetic propensity of cancer cells has been correlated to anticancer drug resistance , but such correlation is unclear in sorafenib resistance of HCC.Methods:Six sorafenib-naive HCC cell lines and one sorafenib-resistant HCC cell line ( Huh-7R ; derived from sorafenib-sensitive Huh-7 ) were used . The bioenergetic propensity was calculated by measurement of lactate in the presence or absence of oligomycin . Dichloroacetate ( DCA ) , a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase ( PDK ) inhibitor , and siRNA of hexokinase 2 ( HK2 ) were used to target relevant pathways of cancer metabolism . Cell viability , mitochondrial membrane potential , and sub-G1 fraction were measured for in vitro efficacy . Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and glucose uptake were also measured . A subcutaneous xenograft mouse model was used for in vivo efficacy.Results:The bioenergetic propensity for using glycolysis correlated with decreased sorafenib sensitivity ( R(2)=0.9067 , among sorafenib-naive cell lines ; P=0.003 , compared between Huh-7 and Huh-7 R ) . DCA reduced lactate production and increased ROS and ATP , indicating activation of oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) . DCA markedly sensitised sorafenib-resistant HCC cells to sorafenib-induced apoptosis ( sub-G1 ( combination vs sorafenib ) : Hep3B , 65.4+/-8.4% vs 13+/-2.9% ; Huh-7 R , 25.3+/- 5.7% vs 4.3+/-1.5% ; each P<0.0001 ) , whereas siRNA of HK2 did not . Sorafenib ( 10 mg kg(-1) per day ) plus DCA ( 100 mg kg(-1) per day ) also resulted in superior tumour regression than sorafenib alone in mice ( tumour size : -87% vs -36% , P<0.001).Conclusion:The bioenergetic propensity is a potentially useful predictive biomarker of sorafenib sensitivity , and activation of OXPHOS by PDK inhibitors may overcome sorafenib resistance of HCC.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication , 20 December 2012 ; doi:10.1038/bjc.2012.559 www.bjcancer.com .
p53 plays an important role in regulating a wide variety of cellular processes , such as cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis . Dysfunction of p53 is frequently associated with several pathologies , such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases . In recent years substantial progress has been made in developing novel p53-activating molecules . Importantly , modulation of p53 interaction with its main inhibitor , Mdm2 , has been highlighted as a promising therapy target . In this regard , bimolecular fluorescence complementation ( BiFC ) analysis , by providing direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells , offers a straightforward method to identify potential modulators of protein interactions . In this study , we developed a simple and robust Venus-based BiFC system to screen for modulators of p53-p53 and p53-Mdm2 interactions in live mammalian cells . We used nutlin-3 , a well-known disruptor of p53-Mdm2 interaction , to validate the specificity of the assay . The reduction of BiFC signal mediated by nutlin-3 was correlated with an increase in Puma transactivation , PARP cleavage , and cell death . Finally , this novel BiFC approach was exploited to identify potential modulators of p53-Mdm2 complex formation among a commercially available chemical library of 33 protein phosphatase inhibitors . Our results constitute " proof-of-concept " that this model has strong potential as an alternative to traditional target-based drug discovery strategies . Identification of new modulators of p53-p53 and p53-Mdm2 interactions will be useful to achieve synergistic drug efficacy with currently used anti-tumor therapies .
Breast cancer constitutes a major health problem for women worldwide . However , its incidence varies between populations and geographical locations . These variations could be diet-related , since there are several carcinogenic compounds in the modern diet , while natural products contain various anti-cancer elements . Several lines of evidence indicate that , in addition to their clear preventive effect , these compounds could also be used as therapeutic agents . In the present report we have shown that oleuropein , a pharmacologically safe natural product of olive leaf , has potent anti-breast cancer properties . Indeed , oleuropein exhibits specific cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells , with higher effect on the basal-like MDA-MB-231 cells than on the luminal MCF-7 cells . This effect is mediated through the induction of apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway . Moreover , oleuropein inhibits cell proliferation by delaying the cell cycle at S phase and up-regulated the cyclin-dependent inhibitor p21 . Furthermore , oleuropein inhibited the anti-apoptosis and pro-proliferation protein NF-kappaB and its main oncogenic target cyclin D1 . This inhibition could explain the great effect of oleuropein on cell proliferation and cell death of breast cancer cells . Therefore , oleuropein warrants further investigations to prove its utility in preventing/treating breast cancer , especially the less-responsive basal-like type .
PURPOSE : Acid ceramidase ( AC ) occupies an important place in the control of cancer cell proliferation . We tested the influence of AC inhibition on the effects of PSC 833 , a P-glycoprotein antagonist with potent ceramide-generating capacity , to determine whether AC could be a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer . METHODS : Ceramide metabolism was followed using ( 3)H-palmitate , and molecular species were determined by mass spectroscopy . Apoptosis was measured by DNA fragmentation , autophagy by acridine orange staining , and cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry and RB phosphorylation . AC was measured in intact cells using fluorescent substrate . RESULTS : Exposure of human PANC-1 or MIA-PaCa-2 cells to PSC 833 promoted increases in de novo ( dihydro)ceramides , ( dihydro)glucosylceramides , and ( dihydro)sphingomyelins , demarking ceramide generation and robust metabolism . Despite the multifold increases in ( dihydro)ceramide levels , cells were refractory to PSC 833 . However , PSC 833 produced a dose-dependent decrease in DNA synthesis and dose- and time-dependent decreases in RB phosphorylation , consistent with cell cycle arrest as demonstrated at G1 . Cytostatic effects of PSC 833 were converted to cytotoxic end-point by acid ceramidase inhibition . Cytotoxicity was accompanied by formation of acridine orange-stained acidic vesicles and an increase in LC3 expression , indicative of autophagic response . Cell death was not reversed by preexposure to myriocin , which blocks PSC 833-induced ceramide generation . CONCLUSION : Although the role of ceramide in end-point cytotoxicity is unclear , our results suggest that acid ceramidase is a viable target in pancreatic cancer . We propose that AC inhibition will be effective in concert with other anticancer therapies .
Epirubicin was developed as a semi-synthetic anthracycline derivative to circumvent the cardiotoxic limitations associated with the use of doxorubicin in the clinic . Anthracycline compounds have been demonstrated to form covalent drug-DNA adducts utilising endogenous and exogenous sources of formaldehyde ; however , previous investigations of the formation of epirubicin-DNA adducts provide conflicting evidence for adduct formation . This work provides evidence that epirubicin acts to form drug-DNA adducts at physiologically relevant concentrations and demonstrates that the rate of formation of epirubicin-DNA adducts is slower than that observed for other anthracycline compounds , explaining why they are only detectable under defined experimental conditions . Formation of covalent epirubicin-DNA adducts improves the apoptotic profile of epirubicin and provides opportunities to overcome drug resistance and cardiotoxic limitations .
BACKGROUND : CD81 is a transmembrane protein that serves as a putative receptor for hepatitis C virus . In addition , CD81 has been suggested to be involved in a broad range of other cellular functions . Its putative implication in tumorigenesis has so far , however , remained largely unexplored . To assess the candidacy of CD81 as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer development , we investigated its expression and function in a series of primary gastric tumors and gastric tumor-derived cell lines . METHODS : The expression and concomitant methylation status of the CD81 gene and its effect on tumor development and cellular signaling were evaluated . RESULTS : CD81 mRNA levels were found to be low in 16 of 40 ( 40% ) primary tumors and 9 of 14 ( 64.2% ) cell lines , and these low expression levels were found to correlate with the stage and grade of the tumors . Genomic alterations of CD81 were not encountered , whereas its expression could be re-activated in low expressing cells upon 5-aza-dC treatment . Bisulfite DNA sequencing analysis of 10 CpG sites within the 5 ' proximal region of the CD81 gene promoter revealed that the observed transcriptional silencing was tightly associated with aberrant hypermethylation . Subsequent restoration of CD81 expression induced a G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis , whereas siRNA-mediated CD81 down-regulation promoted cell proliferation and attenuated cellular responses to various apoptotic stress stimuli . Also the colony-forming ability of the tumor cells could be inhibited and enhanced through CD81 up- and down-regulation , respectively . CD81 was found to inhibit p38 ( but not ERK , JNK and AKT ) phosphorylation and its growth suppressive effect could be abolished through p38 up- and down-regulation . CONCLUSION : From our data we conclude that epigenetic inactivation of CD81 is a common feature of gastric tumors and that this inactivation may render growth and survival advantages to the tumor cells , at least partially through p38 signaling .
Pterostilbene , a polyphenolic compound present in grapes and other fruits , has been demonstrated to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis and autophagy in some cancer cell types . We found that pterostilbene at the IC90 concentration of 44 <FFFD>M inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in MOLT4 human leukemia cells . Treatment with pterostilbene resulted in a transient accumulation of cells in the G0/G1-cell cycle phase followed by the S-phase arrest . Pterostilbene-induced apoptotic death of MOLT4 cells was mediated by caspase-3 activation and was accompanied by the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential , phosphatidylserine externalization and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation . Our results suggest that pterostilbene could serve as a potential additional chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of leukemia .
Context:The ubiquitin-proteasome system and macroautophagy are two major pathways for intracellular protein degradation . Emerging lines of evidence have shown that blockade of ubiquitin-proteasome system by proteasome inhibitors activates macroautophagy.Objective:The purpose of this study was to determine the involvement of autophagy essential gene Beclin 1 in cytotoxicity of thyroid cancer cells mediated by proteasome inhibitors.Design:Autophagy was measured by acidic-trophic dye staining and EGF-LC3 distribution using fluorescence microscopy , as well as LC3-II transition using Western blot . To ascertain the effect of Beclin 1 , cells were transfected with Beclin 1 plasmid or shRNA against Beclin 1 . Cell viability and apoptotic cells were measured using MTT assay and flow cytometry , respectively.Results:Proteasome inhibitors decreased Beclin 1 expression . In addition , treatment with PI3K inhibitors 3-MA or wortmannin , as well as knockdown of Beclin 1 expression , was unable to affect autophagic responses mediated by proteasome inhibitors . Overexpression of Beclin 1 enhanced proteasome inhibitor-mediated cytotoxicity of thyroid cancer cells via suppression of survivin.Conclusions:Proteasome inhibitors cause Beclin 1-independent macroautophagic responses of thyroid cancer cells in a Beclin 1-independent manner . Beclin 1 possesses autophagy-independent antitumoral effects upon exposure of thyroid cancer cells to proteasome inhibitors .
Kaposi sarcoma is the most common neoplasm caused by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) . It is prevalent among the elderly in the Mediterranean , inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa , and immunocompromised individuals such as organ transplant recipients and AIDS patients . Current treatments for Kaposi sarcoma can inhibit tumor growth but are not able to eliminate KSHV from the host . When the host's immune system weakens , KSHV begins to replicate again , and active tumor growth ensues . New therapeutic approaches are needed . Cannabidiol ( CBD ) , a plant-derived cannabinoid , exhibits promising antitumor effects without inducing psychoactive side effects . CBD is emerging as a novel therapeutic for various disorders , including cancer . In this study , we investigated the effects of CBD both on the infection of endothelial cells ( ECs ) by KSHV and on the growth and apoptosis of KSHV-infected ECs , an in vitro model for the transformation of normal endothelium to Kaposi sarcoma . While CBD did not affect the efficiency with which KSHV infected ECs , it reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in those infected by the virus . CBD inhibited the expression of KSHV viral G protein-coupled receptor ( vGPCR ) , its agonist , the chemokine growth-regulated protein alpha ( GRO-alpha ) , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 ( VEGFR-3 ) , and the VEGFR-3 ligand , vascular endothelial growth factor C ( VEGF-C ) . This suggests a potential mechanism by which CBD exerts its effects on KSHV-infected endothelium and supports the further examination of CBD as a novel targeted agent for the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma .
Abstract Different cyclooxygenase ( COX)-2 inhibitors were known to cause different cell cycle changes . We investigated whether this different effect on cell cycle change was due to concentration-dependent effect . We investigated the effects of celecoxib , a COX-2 selective inhibitor , on cell cycle regulation in irradiated cancer cells that express high or low levels of COX-2 . Four stably COX-2 knocked-down or overexpressed cell lines were treated with various concentrations of celecoxib with or without radiation . Celecoxib differentially modulated the cell cycle according to the concentrations applied . G(1) arrest was induced at lower concentrations , whereas G(2)/M arrest was induced at higher concentrations in each cell line tested . Radiation-induced G(2)/M arrest was enhanced at lower concentrations but reduced at higher concentrations . The cutoff values to divide lower and higher concentrations were cell-type specific . Celecoxib treatment activated Cdc25C and inhibited p21 expression in both unirradiated and irradiated cells , regardless of COX-2 expression . Apoptosis was induced in irradiated cells 48 hours after treatment with celecoxib dependent of COX-2 . These results imply that celecoxib deactivates the G(2) checkpoint via both Cdc25C- and p21-dependent pathways in irradiated cells , which subsequently die by secondary apoptosis . Cell cycle modulating effects in irradiated cells resulting from treatment with celecoxib may have clinical importance with regard to the potential application of celecoxib in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy .
Abstract Purpose : Cell death is one of the most important endpoints of radiosensitivity . The tumor suppressor p53 participates not only in regulation of apoptosis , but also in autophagy mechanism . In this study , H1299-P53 ( with wild-type p53 ) and H1299-175H ( with mutant 175H ) were used , and the effects of p53 on radiosensitivity were analyzed . Methods : Cell models with different p53 status were established by gene engineering , and cell viability was examined by colony formation assay , and cell counting kit-8 ( CCK-8 ) , 3-Methyladenine , and Z-VAD were used to block autophagy and apoptosis , respectively . Western blot was used to detect protein expression ; monodansylcadaverine ( MDC ) staining was used to analyze autophagy rate ; DAPI/Propidium Iodide ( PI ) staining and flow cytometry were used to assess apoptosis and necrosis . Results : In parental H1299 , H1299-P53 , and H1299-175H cells , radiosensitivity exhibited different by colony formation and CCK-8 assay ( D0 : 1.764 Gy , 1.407 Gy and 1.695 Gy ; Dq : 2.977 Gy , 1.199 Gy and 2.312 Gy in turn ) . The radiosensitization of p53 was associated with the increase of MDM2 and P21 expression . The ionizing radiation ( IR)-induced apoptosis was significant in H1299-P53 compared with in H1299 and H199-175H ( p<0.05 ) by flow cytometry , and the expression of cleaved-caspase3 was increased in H1299-P53 cells . While the IR-induced autophagy was significant in H1299 cells ( p<0.01 ) and decreased in H1299-P53 and H1299-175H cells ( p<0.01 ) by MDC staining , the expression of MAPLC3II and Beclin-1 increased in H1299 , but not in H1299-p53 and H199-175H cells . The IR-induced cell survival was significantly increased by Z-VAD-FMK and decreased by 3MA in H1299-P53 cells ; IR- induced autophagy was significantly increased by Z-VAD-FMK in H1299-P53 cells ( p<0.01 ) , but not changed in H1299 cells . Conclusion : p53 could regulate radiosensitivity by inhibiting autophagy and activating apoptosis ; autophagy provides a prosurvival mechanism , and p53 potently abrogated the IR-induced autophagy , while mutant 175H shown no effect on radiosensitivity , suggesting that individual treatment strategies should be based on p53 status in patients .
ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : The ubiquitin-proteasome system and macroautophagy ( hereafter referred to autophagy ) are two complementary pathways for protein degradation . Emerging evidence suggests that proteasome inhibition might be a promising approach for tumor therapy . Accumulating data suggest that autophagy is activated as a compensatory mechanism upon proteasome activity is impaired . METHOD : Autophagy activation was measured using acridine orange staining and LC3 transition . Cell viability and apoptosis were measured using MTT assay and flow cytometry , respectively . Beclin 1 expression vectors or shRNA against Beclin 1 ( shBeclin 1 ) were transfected to investigate the role of Beclin 1 in autophagy activation and cytotoxicity of ovarian cancer cells induced by proteasome inhibitors . RESULTS : Proteasome inhibitors suppressed proliferation and induced autophagy in ovarian cancer cells . Neither phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitors nor shRNA against Beclin 1 could abolish the formation of acidic vacuoles and the processing of LC3 induced by proteasome inhibitors . Moreover , Beclin 1 overexpression enhanced anti-proliferative effects of proteasome inhibitors in ovarian cancer cells . CONCLUSIONS : For the first time , the current study demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors induced PI3K and Beclin 1-independent autophagy in ovarian cancer cells . In addition , this study revealed autophagy-independent tumor suppressive effects of Beclin 1 in ovarian cancer cells .
Recently , our group reported the discovery of three new withanolides , physangulidines A-C , from Physalis angulata . In this study , the biological effects of physangulidine A ( 1 ) , which was the most active and abundant of the three new constituents , are described . It was found that 1 significantly reduces survival in clonogenic assays for two hormone-independent prostate cancer cell lines . Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy studies in DU145 human prostate cancer cells indicated that 1 induces cell cycle arrest in the G(2)/M phase and causes defective mitosis . It was determined also that 1 produces programed cell death by apoptosis , as evidenced by biochemical markers and distinct changes in cell morphology . These results imply that the antimitotic and proapoptotic effects of 1 may contribute significantly to the biological activities and potential medicinal properties of its plant of origin .
OBJECTIVES : Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for pancreatic cancer ( PaCa ) . However , the mechanisms of smoking-induced PaCa remain unknown . Here we investigated the effect of smoking compounds on cell death pathways in pancreatic ductal cells , precursors of PaCa . METHODS : Human pancreatic ductal cells ( HPDE6-c7 ) were cultured with cigarette smoke extract ( CSE ) or smoking compound 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone ( NNK ) . Apoptosis and autophagy were assessed by DNA fragmentation and immunofluorescence , respectively . RESULTS : Exposure to CSE or NNK decreased DNA fragmentation and up-regulated BclXL . Akt kinase was activated by smoking compounds through reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism . Specifically , Akt activation was prevented by inhibition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase . Molecular or pharmacologic inhibitions of Akt prevented the antiapoptotic effect of smoking compounds . Smoking compounds stimulated rapid ( 1 hour ) and transient activation of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and formation of autophagic vacuoles , indicating stimulation of autophagy . Repeated exposure to CSE/NNK ( 48 hours or longer ) abolished the early activation of autophagic markers . Inhibition of Akt prevented the antiautophagic effect of long exposure to smoking compounds , indicating that smoking-induced late activation of Akt prevents autophagy . CONCLUSIONS : Long exposure of pancreatic ductal cells to smoking compounds inhibited apoptosis and autophagy . The results revealed a central role for Akt kinase in mediating key procarcinogenic effects of smoking compounds .
Loss of p53 is considered to allow progression of colorectal tumors from the adenoma to the carcinoma stage . Using mice with an intestinal epithelial cell ( IEC)-specific p53 deletion , we demonstrate that loss ofp53 alone is insufficient to initiate intestinal tumorigenesis but markedly enhances carcinogen-induced tumor incidence and leads to invasive cancer and lymph node metastasis . Whereas p53 controls DNA damage and IEC survival during the initiation stage , loss of p53 during tumor progression is associated with increased intestinal permeability , causing formation of an NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory microenvironment and the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition . Thus , we propose a p53-controlled tumor-suppressive function that is independent of its well-established role in cell-cycle regulation , apoptosis , and senescence .
Indolylmaleimides display a broad spectrum of biological activity and offer great opportunity to influence several aspects of cell fate , as proliferation and differentiation . In this study we describe the effect of PDA-66 , a newly synthesised indolylmaleimide , showing a strong dose dependent anti-proliferative effect on immortalised human progenitor and cancer cells . We demonstrated a highly depolymerizing effect on in vitro tubulin assembly and conclude that PDA-66 acts as microtubule destabilising agent . In addition we found that PDA-66 induces mitotic arrest of cells in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle . Subsequently cells undergo apoptosis , indicating the major mechanism of the anti-proliferative effect . To prove a potential anti-cancer activity of PDA-66 we examined the effect of PDA-66 on human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and A-459 lung cancer cells , showing a significant reduction in cancer cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner . Thus PDA-66 is a new anti-mitotic compound with an indole-core with the potential to be used for cancer therapy .
In human epithelial cancers , the microRNA ( miRNA ) mir-30d is amplified with high frequency and serves as a critical oncomir by regulating metastasis , apoptosis , proliferation , and differentiation . Autophagy , a degradation pathway for long-lived protein and organelles , regulates the survival and death of many cell types . Increasing evidence suggests that autophagy plays an important function in epithelial tumor initiation and progression . Using a combined bioinformatics approach , gene set enrichment analysis and miRNA target prediction , we found that mir-30d might regulate multiple genes in the autophagy pathway including BECN1 , BNIP3L , ATG12 , ATG5 , ATG2 . Our further functional experiments demonstrated that the expression of these core proteins in the autophagy pathway was directly suppressed by mir-30d in cancer cells . Finally , we showed that mir-30d regulated the autophagy process by inhibiting autophagosome formation and LC3B-I conversion to LC3B-II . Taken together , our results provide evidence that the oncomir mir-30d impairs the autophagy process by targeting multiple genes in the autophagy pathway . This result will contribute to understanding the molecular mechanism of mir-30d in tumorigenesis and developing novel cancer therapy strategy .
Compound C , a well-known inhibitor of the intracellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , has been reported to cause apoptotic cell death in myeloma , breast cancer cells and glioma cells . In this study , we have demonstrated that compound C not only induced autophagy in all tested skin cancer cell lines but also caused more apoptosis in p53 wildtype skin cancer cells than in p53-mutant skin cancer cells . Compound C can induce upregulation , phosphorylation and nuclear translocalization of the p53 protein and upregulate expression of p53 target genes in wildtype p53-expressing skin basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) cells . The changes of p53 status were dependent on DNA damage which was caused by compound C induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation and associated with activated ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) protein . Using the wildtype p53-expressing BCC cells versus stable p53-knockdown BCC sublines , we present evidence that p53-knockdown cancer cells were much less sensitive to compound C treatment with significant G2/M cell cycle arrest and attenuated the compound C-induced apoptosis but not autophagy . The compound C induced G2/M arrest in p53-knockdown BCC cells was associated with the sustained inactive Tyr15 phosphor-Cdc2 expression . Overall , our results established that compound C-induced apoptosis in skin cancer cells was dependent on the cell's p53 status .
Nitric oxide ( NO)-releasing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NO-NSAIDs ) which have been synthesized to reduce gastro-intestinal and cardiovascular toxicities of NSAIDs , possess anti-proliferative , pro-apoptotic and anti-cancer activities . Here , we show that NO-sulindac inhibited UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis in SKH-1 hairless mice . Topical application of NO-sulindac reduced tumor incidence , number ( p<0.05 ) and volume ( p<0.005 ) as compared to UVB ( alone)-irradiated vehicle-treated mice . An increase in TUNEL-positive cells in skin lesions was accompanied by the enhanced Bax:Bcl-2 ratio . The expression of pro-apoptotic Bax was increased whereas anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 reduced . However , proliferation was identified as the major target of NO-sulindac in this study . A reduced expression of PCNA and cyclin D1 associated with the dampening of cell cycle progression was observed . The mechanism of this inhibition was related to the reduction in UVB-induced Notch signaling pathway . UVB-induced inflammatory responses were diminished by NO-sulindac as observed by a remarkable reduction in the levels of phosphorylated MAP Kinases Erk1/2 , p38 and JNK1/2 . In this regard , NO-sulindac also inhibited NFkappaB by enhancing IkappaBalpha as evidenced by the reduced expression of iNOS and COX-2 , the direct NFkappaB transcription target proteins . NO-sulindac significantly diminished the progression of benign lesions to invasive carcinomas by suppressing the tumor aggressiveness and retarding epithelial-mesenchymal transition . A marked decrease in the expression of mesenchymal markers such as Fibronectin , N-cadherin , SNAI , Slug and Twist and an increase in epithelial cell polarity marker E-cadherin were noted in NO-sulindac-treated tumors . Our data suggest that NO-sulindac is a potent inhibitor of UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis and acts by targeting proliferation-regulatory pathways .
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer with a high incidence rate worldwide . One of the promising therapeutic approaches on breast cancer is to use the drugs that target the estrogen receptor ( ER ) . In the present investigation , marmorin , a type I ribosome inactivating protein from the mushroom Hypsizigus marmoreus , inhibited the survival of breast cancer in vitro and in vivo . It evinced more potent cytotoxicity toward estrogen receptor ( ER)-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells than ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells . Further study disclosed that marmorin undermined the expression level of estrogen receptor alpha ( ERalpha ) and significantly inhibited the proliferation of MCF7 cells induced by 17beta-estradiol . Knockdown of ERalpha in MCF7 cells significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of marmorin on proliferation , suggesting that the ERalpha-mediated pathway was implicated in the suppressive action of marmorin on ER-positive breast cancer cells . Moreover , marmorin induced time-dependent apoptosis in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells . It brought about G2/M-phase arrest , mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization and caspase-9 activation in MCF7 cells , and to a lesser extent in MDA-MB-231 cells . Marmorin triggered the death receptor apoptotic pathway ( e.g. caspase-8 activation ) and endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ERS , as evidenced by phosphorylation of PERK and IRE1alpha , cleavage of caspase-12 , and up-regulation of CHOP expression ) in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells . In summary , marmorin exhibited inhibitory effect on breast cancer partially via diminution of ERalpha and apoptotic pathways mediated by mitochondrial , death receptor and ERS . The results advocate that marmorin is a potential candidate for breast cancer therapy .
It is well established that hyperplasia and decreased apoptosis of airway smooth muscle cells ( ASMCs ) play an important role in the asthmatic airway remodeling . Tumor suppressor PTEN gene with phosphatase activity plays an important regulatory role in embryonic development , cell proliferation , and apoptosis , cell cycle regulation , migration ( invasion ) of the cytoskeleton . We hypotheses that PTEN gene could affect the growth and viability of ASMCs through the regulation of PI3K/Akt , MAPK , and cell cycle-related gene expression . We constructed a recombinant adenovirus to transfect ASMCs . Cells were divided into the overexpression of PTEN gene group ( Ad-PTEN-GFP ) , negative control group ( Ad-GFP ) , and blank control group ( DMEM ) . The cell apoptosis of ASMCs were evaluated by Hoechst-33342 staining and PE-7AAD double-labeled flow cytometry . The cell cycle distribution was observed by flow cytometry with PI staining . The expression of PTEN , p-Akt , total-Akt , p-ERK1/2 , total-ERK1/2 , cleaved-Caspases-3 , Caspases-9 , p21 , and Cyclin D1 were tested by the Western blotting . Our study revealed that overexpression of PTEN gene did not induce apoptosis of human ASMCs cultured in vitro . However , overexpression of PTEN inhibited proliferation of human ASMCs cultured in vitro and was associated with downregulation of Akt phosphorylation levels , while did not affect ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels . Moreover , overexpression of PTEN could induce ASMCs arrested in the G0/G1 phase through the downregulation of Cyclin D1 and upregulation of p21 expressions .
Platinum compounds are the foundation of chemotherapy regimens for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) despite poor response rates and limited response duration . It has been reported that tumor expression of ERCC1 , a key component in nucleotide excision repair , may correlate with clinical response to platinum agents . We found that most primary lung tumor specimens demonstrated a stronger protein expression of poly ( ADP ribose ) polymerases 1 ( PARP1 ) than their normal counterparts . We therefore hypothesized that combining PARP inhibition with platinum compounds may be an approach to improve platinum-based therapy for NSCLC . Drug combination experiments revealed that two distinct PARP inhibitors , olaparib and veliparib not only potentiated the cell killing by cisplatin but also conferred cytotoxicity as a single agent specifically in ERCC1-low HCC827 and PC9 but not in ERCC1-high A549 and H157 lung cancer cells . Moreover , siRNA knockdown of ERCC1 in A549 and H157 cells increased their sensitivities to both cisplatin and olaparib in a synergistic manner in our model . Furthermore , mechanistic studies indicated that combined PARP inhibitor and cisplatin could lead to sustained DNA double strand breaks , prolonged G2/M cell cycle arrest with distinct activation of checkpoint kinase 1 signaling , and more pronounced apoptosis preferentially in lung cancer cells with low ERCC1 expression . Collectively , these data suggest that there is a synergistic relationship between PARP inhibition and low ERCC1 expression in NSCLC that could be exploited for novel therapeutic approaches in lung cancer therapy based on tumor ERCC1 expression .
Sonodynamic therapy ( SDT ) has shown great potential in target cancer therapy , but it induced cell death modes hasn't been fully investigated . This study was to examine autophagic and apoptotic responses to protoporphyrin IX ( PpIX ) mediated SDT in murine leukemia L1210 cells . After SDT , the occurrence of autophagy was identified by morphological observation and biochemical analysis . Meanwhile , the mitochondria dependent apoptosis pathway was examined to participate in SDT induced cell death . The relationship between autophagy and apoptosis was further investigated by applying pharmacological inhibition studies , which indicated that impairment of autophagy enhanced the anti-tumor effect of SDT through induction of apoptosis and necrosis , while caspase inhibition didn't affect autophagic vacuoles formation or protect SDT induced cytotoxicity . The findings supported that autophagic vacuoles formed upstream and independently from caspase-dependent cell death . Additionally , the possible mechanism of SDT-induced autophagy was evaluated by measurement of ROS ( reactive oxygen species ) formation . Result suggested ROS play important role in initiating autophagy , possibly through the sono-damaged mitochondria being enclosed by autophagic vacuoles . All together , these data indicate that autophagy may be cytoprotective in our experimental system , and point to an important insight into how autophagy inhibitors , in combination with SDT may contribute a regimen for cancer therapy .
The anti-tumor antibiotic salinomycin ( Sal ) was recently identified as a selective inhibitor of breast cancer stem cells ; however , the effect of Sal on hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is not clear . This study aimed to determine the anti-tumor efficacy and mechanism of Sal on HCC . HCC cell lines ( HepG2 , SMMC-7721 , and BEL-7402 ) were treated with Sal . Cell doubling time was determinated by drawing growth curve , cell viability was evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit 8 . The fraction of CD133(+) cell subpopulations was assessed by flow cytometry . We found that Sal inhibits proliferation and decreases PCNA levels as well as the proportion of HCC CD133(+)cell subpopulations in HCC cells . Cell cycle was analyzed using flow cytometry and showed that Sal caused cell cycle arrest of the various HCC cell lines in different phases . Cell apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining . Sal induced apoptosis as characterized by an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio . Several signaling pathways were selected for further mechanistic analyses using real time-PCR and Western blot assays . Compared to control , beta-catenin expression is significantly down-regulated upon Sal addition . The Ca(2+) concentration in HCC cells was examined by flow cytometry and higher Ca(2+) concentrations were observed in Sal treatment groups . The anti-tumor effect of Sal was further verified in vivo using the hepatoma orthotopic tumor model and the data obtained showed that the size of liver tumors in Sal-treated groups decreased compared to controls . Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining also demonstrated that Sal inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in vivo . Finally , the role of Sal on in vivo Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was evaluated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry . This study demonstrates Sal inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo and one potential mechanism is inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling via increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels .
CDA-2 ( cell differentiation agent 2 ) , a urinary preparation , has potent anti- proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties in cancer cells . However , the mechanisms of tumor inhibitory action of CDA-2 are far from clear , and especially there was no report on lung cancer . Here we demonstrate that CDA-2 and its main component phenylacetylglutamine ( PG ) reduce the metastatic lung tumor growth , and increases survival time after inoculation with Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) cells in a dose-dependent manner in C57BL6 mice . Proliferative program analysis in cancer cells revealed a fundamental impact of CDA-2 and PG on proliferation and apoptosis , including Bcl-2 , Bcl-XL , cIAP1 , Survivin , PCNA , Ki-67 proteins and TUNEL assays . CDA-2 and PG significantly reduced NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in lung cancer cells and in alveolar macrophages of tumor bearing mice and especially decreased the release of inflammatory factors including TNFalpha , IL-6 , and KC . Furthermore , CDA-2 and PG decrease the expressions of TLR2 , TLR6 , and CD14 , but not TLR1 , TLR3 , TLR4 , and TLR9 in bone-marrow-derived macrophages ( BMDM ) of mice stimulated by LLC-conditioned medium ( LLC-CM ) . Over-expressing TLR2 in BMDM prevented CDA-2 and PG from inhibiting NF-kappaB activation , as well as induction of TNFalpha and IL-6 . TLR2:TLR6 complexes mediate the effect of NF-kappaB inactivation by CDA-2 . In conclusion , CDA-2 potently inhibits lung tumor development by reduction of the inflammation in lung through suppression of NF-kappaB activation in myeloid cells , associating with modulation of TLR2 signaling .
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in elderly men worldwide and its incidence rate is rising continuously . Agents capable of inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells seem a promising approach to treat this malignancy . In this study we describe the synthesis of a number of novel N- and N,N'-substituted S-2,3,4,5,6-pentabromobenzylisothiouronium bromides and their activity against the human prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 cell line . All the compounds produced changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cell cycle progression , showed a cytostatic effect and induced apoptosis in the tested cancer line in a concentration- and time-dependent manner . The most effective compounds ZKK-3 , ZKK-9 and ZKK-13 produced , at 20 microM concentration , apoptosis in 42 , 46 , and 66% of the cells , respectively , after 48 h incubation . Two selected S-2,3,4,5,6-pentabromobenzylisothiouronium bromides ( ZKK-3 , ZKK-9 ) showed also a synergic proapoptotic effect with the new casein kinase II inhibitor 2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole ( TBIPIP ) in the PC3 cell line .
Objective To investigate the effect of bufalin on nucleus-mitochondria localization of human telomerase reverse transcriptase(hTERT) by exploring its effect on proliferation and apoptosis in human esophageal squamous carcinoma EC9706 cells . Methods EC9706 cells were treated with bufalin at various concentrations , and then the cell growth inhibition of EC9706 cells was examined by CCK-8 assay and the 50% inhibitory concentration ( IC(50) ) was calculated.Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry with PI staining , and nucleus morphology of apoptosis were observed by fluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33342 staining . The apoptotic index was measured by flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. hTERT subcellular localization and protein expression were determined by Western blotting and multiple immunofluorescence labling combined with laser confocal scanning microscopy . Results The proliferation of EC 9706 cells was significantly inhibited by bufalin along with the increase of processing time and concentrations ( p<0.01 ) . After the EC9706 cells were exposed to 100 nmol/L bufalin,the number of cells gradually decreased in G(1) phase and increased in S and G(2)/M phases(p<0.05) . The typical nucleus morphological changes of apoptosis were observed and the apoptotic index was increased(p<0.01) . The expression of hTERT decreased in nucleus but increased in mitochondria(p<0.05) . Conclusions Bufalin can inhibit the proliferation of human esophageal squamous carcinoma EC9706 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner . It can arrest cell cycle in S and G(2)/M phases and induce the apoptosis of EC 9706 cells. hTERT is localized in both nucleus and mitochondria,and can be partially translocated from nucleus to mitochondria during the bufalin-induced apoptosis .
Immunosuppressive oligodeoxynucleotides ( SupODNs ) containing repetitive TTAGGG motifs reduce inflammation and , thus , may have an impact on inflammation-related tumor growth . In this study , we found a significant antiproliferative effect of Sup ODNs on the A549 non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell line compared to those treated with control ODNs ( p<0.05 ) . Sup-ODN-mediated G1 phase cell cycle arrest was achieved via inhibition of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation and the p15INK4b and p27KIP1/retinoblastoma protein pathway . In addition , Sup ODNs induced apoptosis and enhanced apoptosis when combined with vinorelbine . In a setting similar to clinical use of multidrug chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC , these effects were investigated by using Sup ODNs in combination with conventional anticancer drugs . Sup ODNs had a significant synergistic effect with 5-fluorouracil , vinorelbine , gemcitabine , paclitaxel and irinotecan , with a mean combination index of 0.43-0.78 ( <1.0 indicates synergism ) in the A549 NSCLC cell line . In conclusion , our results showed that Sup ODNs have an anticancer effect and increase the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to conventional anticancer drugs by modifying Akt and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway . Thus , Sup ODNs may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients .
Diarylquinoline compounds are newly synthesized derivatives of the new anti-tuberculosis drug , TMC207 . In this study , nine diarylquinoline compounds were screened for cytotoxic activity against human tumor cells , and their mechanisms of action were investigated . Among the nine compounds , STM-57 [ N-((6-bromo-2-methoxyquinolin-3-yl)(phenyl)methl)-N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-(4 -methylpiperazin-1-yl)propanamide ] showed potent cytotoxic activity . STM-57 induced caspase-independent cell death in the human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line , CNE-2 . Further investigation showed that STM-57 induced autophagy , as determined with the increased expression of green fluorescent protein-light chain3 ( GFP-LC3 ) and increased LC3-II levels . STM-57 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) in CNE-2 cells . The intracellular calcium concentration and reactive oxygen species levels were increased in CNE-2 cells following treatment with STM-57 , whereas the mitochondrial transmembrane potential ( DeltaPsim ) and ATP concentrations were decreased .
Here , we provide the necessary proof of concept , that it is possible to metabolically create a non-permissive or " hostile " stromal microenvironment , which actively prevents tumor engraftment in vivo . We developed a novel genetically engineered fibroblast cell line that completely prevents tumor formation in mice , with a 100% protection rate . No host side effects were apparent.This could represent a viable cellular strategy for preventing and treating a variety of human cancers . More specifically , we examined the autocrine and paracrine effects of the cellular delivery of TNF-alpha on breast cancer tumor growth and cancer metabolism . For this purpose , we recombinantly overexpressed TNF-alpha in human breast cancer cells ( MDA-MB-231 ) or human immortalized fibroblasts ( hTERT-BJ1 ) . Our results directly show that TNF-alpha functions as a potent tumor suppressor . Remarkably , TNF-alpha-expressing breast cancer cells were viable , without any significant increases in their basal apoptotic rate . However , after 4 weeks post-implantation , TNF-alpha-expressing breast cancer cells failed to form any tumors in xenografted mice ( 0 tumors/10 injections ) , ultimately conferring 100% protection against tumorigenesis . Similarly , TNF-alpha-overexpressing fibroblasts were also viable , without any increases in apoptosis . Significantly , complete tumor suppression was obtained by co-injecting TNF-alpha expressing stromal fibroblasts with human breast cancer cells , indicating that paracrine cell-mediated delivery of TNF-alpha can also prevent tumor engraftment and growth ( 0 tumors/10 injections ) . Mechanistically , TNF-alpha induced autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in both epithelial cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts , preventing energy transfer from the tumor microenvironment , likely " starving " the cancer cells to death . In addition , via qRT-PCR analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells , we observed that TNF-alpha mediated the up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with inflammation and senescence [ IL-1-beta , IL-6 , IL-8 , MCP-1 , COX-2 , p21(WAF1/CIP1) ] and downregulated known tumor-promoting genes ( collagen VI and MMP2 ) . Recombinant overexpression of TNF-alpha receptor(s) in MDA-MB-231 cells also significantly reduced tumor growth , but was not as effective as the TNF-alpha ligand itself in preventing tumor growth . Thus , we propose that stromal cell-mediated delivery of TNF-alpha to human tumors [ using transfected fibroblasts or mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs) ] may be a novel and effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of human cancers .
Protein kinase B ( AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the tumorigenesis and progression of multiple tumors , and has been shown to be important therapeutic targets for cancer . The present study aimed to explore the role and molecular mechanisms of AKT/mTOR pathway in human hemangioma ( HA ) . Twenty-five cases of human HA tissues were collected . The expression of AKT , mTOR and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) proteins was evaluated using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry in biopsy samples in different phases of HA . AKT/mTOR pathway was blocked by recombinant small hairpin RNA adenovirus vector rAd5-AKT+mTOR ( rAd5-Am ) , used for infecting proliferating phase HA-derived endothelial cells ( HDEC ) . The expression of AKT , mTOR and PCNA was detected by Real-time PCR and Western blot assays . Cell proliferative activities were determined by MTT assay , and cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry . As a consequence , the expression of AKT , mTOR and PCNA was significantly increased in proliferative phase HA , while that was decreased in involutive phase . Combined blockade of AKT/mTOR pathway by rAd5-Am diminished cell proliferative activities , and induced cell apoptosis and cycle arrest with the decreased expression of AKT , mTOR and PCNA in proliferative phase HDEC . In conclusion , the activity of AKT/mTOR pathway was increased in proliferative phase HA , while it was decreased in involutive phase . Combined blockade of AKT/mTOR pathway might suppress cell proliferation via down-regulation of PCNA expression , and induce apoptosis and cycle arrest in proliferative phase HDEC , suggesting that AKT/mTOR pathway might represent the important therapeutic targets for human HA .
Activation of p53 effectively inhibits tumor angiogenesis that is necessary for tumor growth and metastasis . Reactivation of the p53 by small molecules has emerged as a promising new strategy for cancer therapy . Several classes of small-molecules that activate the p53 pathway have been discovered using various approaches . Here , we identified harmine ( beta-carboline alkaloid ) as a novel activator of p53 signaling involved in inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth . Harmine induced p53 phosphorylation and disrupted the p53-MDM2 interaction . Harmine also prevented p53 degradation in the presence of cycloheximide and activated nuclear accumulation of p53 followed by increasing its transcriptional activity in endothelial cells . Moreover , harmine not only induced endothelial cell cycle arrest and apoptosis , but also suppressed endothelial cell migration and tube formation as well as induction of neovascularity in a mouse corneal micropocket assay . Finally , harmine inhibited tumor growth by reducing tumor angiogenesis , as demonstrated by a xenograft tumor model . Our results suggested a novel mechanism and bioactivity of harmine , which inhibited tumor growth by activating the p53 signaling pathway and blocking angiogenesis in endothelial cells .
Angiogenesis , the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vascular beds , is essential for tumor growth , invasion , and metastasis . Luteolin is a common dietary flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables . We studied the antiangiogenic activity of luteolin using in vitro , ex vivo , and in vivo models . In vitro studies using rat aortic ring assay showed that luteolin at non-toxic concentrations significantly inhibited microvessel sprouting and proliferation , migration , invasion and tube formation of endothelial cells , which are key events in the process of angiogenesis . Luteolin also inhibited ex vivo angiogenesis as revealed by chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane assay ( CAM ) and matrigel plug assay . Gelatin zymographic analysis demonstrated the inhibitory effect of luteolin on the activation of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 . Western blot analysis showed that luteolin suppressed VEGF induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 and their downstream protein kinases AKT , ERK , mTOR , P70S6K , MMP-2 , and MMP-9 in HUVECs . Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNF-alpha level were significantly reduced by the treatment of luteolin in PC-3 cells . Luteolin ( 10 mg/kg/d ) significantly reduced the volume and the weight of solid tumors in prostate xenograft mouse model , indicating that luteolin inhibited tumorigenesis by targeting angiogenesis . CD31 and CD34 immunohistochemical staining further revealed that the microvessel density could be remarkably suppressed by luteolin . Moreover , luteolin reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells , which were correlated with the downregulation of AKT , ERK , mTOR , P70S6K , MMP-2 , and MMP-9 expressions . Taken together , our findings demonstrate that luteolin inhibits human prostate tumor growth by suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-mediated angiogenesis .
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world . Achaete-scute complex homolog-1 ( Ascl1 ) is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factor family that has multiple functions in the normal and neoplastic lung such as the regulation of neuroendocrine differentiation , prevention of apoptosis and promotion of tumor-initiating cells . We now show that Ascl1 directly regulates matrix metalloproteinase-7 ( MMP-7 ) and O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) . Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in human bronchial epithelial and lung carcinoma cell lines revealed that Ascl1 , MMP-7 and MGMT are able to protect cells from the tobacco-specific nitrosamine NNK-induced DNA damage and the alkylating agent cisplatin-induced apoptosis . We also examined the role of Ascl1 in NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis in vivo . Using transgenic mice which constitutively expressed human Ascl1 in airway lining cells , we found that there was a delay in lung tumorigenesis . We conclude that Ascl1 potentially enhances DNA repair through activation of MMP-7 and MGMT which may impact lung carcinogenesis and chemoresistance . The study has uncovered a novel and unexpected function of Ascl1 which will contribute to better understanding of lung carcinogenesis and the broad implications of transcription factors in tobacco-related carcinogenesis .
We had demonstrated that plasminogen kringle 5 ( K5 ) , a potent angiogenic inhibitor , inhibited retinal neovascularization and hepatocellular carcinoma growth by anti-angiogenesis . The current study investigated the effects and the underlying mechanisms of K5 on both tumor growth and spontaneous pulmonary metastasis in Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) implanted mouse model . Similarly , K5 could decrease expression of VEGF in LLC cells and grafted tissues and suppress tumor angiogenesis and growth . K5 had no direct effect on proliferation and apoptosis of LLC . However , K5 could significantly inhibit SDF-1alpha-induced chemotaxis movement of LLC cells and resulted in a great reduction of surface metastatic nodules and micrometastases in the lungs of LLC tumor-bearing mice . K5 also decreased expression of chemokine ( C-X-C motif ) receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) in LLC cells and grafted tissues . Furthermore , K5 down-regulated SDF-1alpha expression in metastatic lung tissues of LLC-bearing mice . Therefore , K5 may suppress tumor pulmonary metastasis through inhibiting SDF-1alpha-CXCR4 chemotaxis movement and down-regulation of VEGF . Moreover , the role of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha ( HIF-1alpha ) , a crucial transcriptional factor for both VEGF and CXCR4 expression , was evaluated . The siRNA of HIF-1alpha attenuated expression of VEGF and CXCR4 and inhibited LLC migration . K5 decreased HIF-1alpha protein level and impaired nuclear HIF-1alpha accumulation . These results showed for the first time that K5 inhibits LLC growth and metastasis via the dual effects of anti-angiogenesis and suppression of tumor cell motility by targeting the pivotal molecule , HIF-1alpha .
Novel strategies are necessary to improve chemotherapy response in advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer . Here , we demonstrate that terpenoids present in the Steam Distilled Extract of Ginger ( SDGE ) are potent inhibitors of proliferation of endometrial cancer cells . SDGE , isolated from six different batches of ginger rhizomes , consistently inhibited proliferation of the endometrial cancer cell lines Ishikawa and ECC-1 at IC(50) of 1.25 <FFFD>g/ml . SDGE also enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of radiation and cisplatin . Decreased proliferation of Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells was a direct result of SDGE-induced apoptosis as demonstrated by FITC-Annexin V staining and expression of cleaved caspase 3 . GC/MS analysis identified a total of 22 different terpenoid compounds in SDGE , with the isomers neral and geranial constituting 30-40% . Citral , a mixture of neral and geranial inhibited the proliferation of Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells at an IC(50) 10 <FFFD>M ( 2.3 <FFFD>g/ml ) . Phenolic compounds such as gingerol and shogaol were not detected in SDGE and 6-gingerol was a weaker inhibitor of the proliferation of the endometrial cancer cells . SDGE was more effective in inducing cancer cell death than citral , suggesting that other terpenes present in SDGE were also contributing to endometrial cancer cell death . SDGE treatment resulted in a rapid and strong increase in intracellular calcium and a 20-40% decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential . Ser-15 of p53 was phosphorylated after 15 min treatment of the cancer cells with SDGE . This increase in p53 was associated with 90% decrease in Bcl2 whereas no effect was observed on Bax . Inhibitor of p53 , pifithrin-alpha , attenuated the anti-cancer effects of SDGE and apoptosis was also not observed in the p53(neg) SKOV-3 cells . Our studies demonstrate that terpenoids from SDGE mediate apoptosis by activating p53 and should be therefore be investigated as agents for the treatment of endometrial cancer .
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in the world and is one of the leading causes of death due to cancer . Health benefits have been linked to additive and synergistic combinations of phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables . Nigella sativa has been shown to possess anti-carcinogenic activity , inhibiting growth of several cancer cell lines in vitro . However , the molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer properties of Nigella sativa phytochemical extracts have not been completely understood . Our data showed that Nigella sativa extracts significantly inhibited human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation at doses of 2.5-5 mug/mL ( P<0.05 ) . Apoptotic induction in MDA-MB-231 cells was observed in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to Nigella sativa extracts for 48 h . Real time PCR and flow cytometry analyses suggested that Nigella sativa extracts possess the ability to suppress the proliferation of human breast cancer cells through induction of apoptosis .
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is still an incurable disease with resistance to therapy developing in the majority of patients . We investigated the effect of TPEN , an intracellular zinc chelator , in Jurkat and in ex vivo acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) cells resistant to chemotherapy . Changes of nuclei morphology , reactive oxygen species generation , presence of hypodiploid cells , phosphatidylserine translocation , mitochondrial membrane depolarization , immunohistochemical identification of cell death signalling molecules , and pharmacological inhibition were assayed to detect the apoptotic cell death pathways . We found that TPEN induces apoptosis in both types of cells by a molecular oxidative stress pathway involving O(2)(*-) > H(2)O(2) > NF-kappaB ( JNK/c-Jun ) >p53> loss DeltaPsi(m)> caspase-3 , AIF > chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation . Interestingly , TPEN induced apoptosis independently of glucose ; leukemic cells are therefore devoid of survival capacity by metabolic resistance to treatment . Most importantly , TPEN cytotoxic effect can eventually be regulated by the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine and zinc ions . Our data suggest that TPEN can be used as a potential therapeutic prooxidant agent against refractory leukemia . These data contribute to understanding the importance of oxidative stress in the treatment of ALL .
The Punica granatum L. var. granatum ( pomegranate ) has been demonstrated to exert antitumor effects on various types of cancer cells . The present study aimed to evaluate the medicinal herbs Punica granatum L. var. spinosa ( apple punice ) that are native to Iran . This study was determined to test the possible cytotoxic activity and induction of apoptosis on human prostate cell lines . The effect of ethanol extracts of the herbs on the inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed by MTT colorimetric assay . PC3 cell lines treated with the extracts were analyzed for the induction of apoptosis by cell death detection ( ELISA ) and TUNEL assay . Dye exclusion analysis was performed for viability rate . Our results demonstrated that the Punica granatum L. var. spinosa extract dose dependently suppressed the proliferation of PC3 cells ( IC(50)= 250.21 mug/mL ) when compared with a chemotherapeutic anticancer drug ( Toxol ) ( Vesper Pharmaceuticals ) with increased nucleosome production from apoptotic cells . The Punica granatum L. var. spinosa extract attenuated the human prostate cell proliferation in vitro possibly by inducing apoptosis . The Punica granatum L. var. spinosa is likely to be valuable for the treatment of some forms of human prostate cell line .
This study aimed to observe the effects of octreotide ( OCT ) on cisplatin resistance reversal of cancer cells in vitro and in nude mice in vivo . MTT method and flow cytometry were used to investigate the effect of cisplatin , OCT or the combination of these two compounds on the proliferation and apoptosis of SKOV3-DDP cells . The size and weight of xenograft tumors from the nude mice model were measured . Real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of SSTR2 , MDR1 , MRP2 , GST-pi and EGFR in SKOV3/DDP cells following the different treatment . At the concentration of 2.5-20 g/ml , OCT significantly reduced IC50 ( p < 0.05 ) and promoted apoptosis ( p < 0.05 ) of SKOV3-DDP cells ' response to cisplatin . Unchanged expression was found in SSTR2 on the SKOV3/DDP cell in vitro after OCT treatment , but increased expression in vivo ( p < 0.05 ) . OCT increased GST-pi expression ( p < 0.05 ) and reduced MRP2 and EGFR expression ( p < 0.05 ) in a dose-dependent manner . The similar results were obtained in mice in vivo experiment , except the reduced expression of GST-pi . It is suggested that OCT could inhibit ovarian cancer proliferation and promote apoptosis , via the cell surface SSTR2 , and reverse cisplatin resistance through inhibition of MRP2 , EGFR , and even GST-pi expressions .
The purpose of the study was to evaluate Sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) derived receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition on tumor progression in murine islet cell tumors . Sorafenib is considered to be a potent inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and neovascularization in various solid tumors . Rip1Tag2 mice were treated in two different groups according to the model of tumor progression : the early treatment group received vehicle or Sorafenib from 10 to 14 weeks of age and the late treatment group from week 12 until death . Tumor surface , tumor cell proliferation , and apoptosis were measured in both treatment groups to assess the in vivo effects of Sorafenib . Survival was recorded for the late treatment group . In the early treatment group Sorafenib led to a dramatic decrease in tumor volume compared to the control group . Apoptosis was significantly augmented and cell proliferation was inhibited . As a single therapy Sorafenib significantly improved survival in the late treatment group . Conclusion . Sorafenib may provide a new paradigm for the therapy of islet cell tumors .
Cellular redox changes have emerged as a pivotal and proximal event in cancer . PKI 166 is used to determine the effects of redox sensitive inhibition of EGFR , metastasis and apoptosis in epidermoid carcinoma . Cytotoxicity study of PKI 166 ( IC50 1.0 microM ) treated A431 cells were performed by MTT assay for 48 and 72 hrs . Morphological analysis of PKI 166 treated A431 cells for 48 hrs. revealed the cell shrinkage , loss of filopodia and lamellipodia by phase contrast and SEM images in dose dependent manner . It has cytotoxic effects through inhibiting cellular proliferation , leads to the induction of apoptosis , as increased fraction of sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle , chromatin condensation and DNA ladder . It inhibited cyclin-D1 and cyclin-E expression and induced p53 , p21 expression in dose dependent manner . Consequently , an imbalance of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio triggered caspase cascade and subsequent cleavage of PARP , thereby shifting the balance in favour of apoptosis . PKI 166 treatment actively stimulated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and mitochondrial membrane depolarization . It inhibited some metastatic properties of A431 cells supressing colony formation by soft agar assay and inhibition of MMP 9 activity by gelatin zymography and western blot analysis . PKI 166 inhibited growth factor induced phosphorylation of EGFR , Akt , MAPK , JNK and colony formation in A431 cells . Thus the inhibition of proliferation was associated with redox regulation of the caspase cascade , EGFR , Akt/PI3K , MAPK/ ERK and JNK pathway . On the other hand , increased antioxidant activity leads to decreased ROS generation inhibit the anti-proliferative and apoptotic properties of PKI 166 in A431 cells . These observations indicated PKI 166 induced redox signalling dependent inhibition of cell proliferation , metastatic properties and induction of apoptotic potential in epidermoid carcinoma .
Bcl-2/E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 ( BNIP3 ) is a proapoptotic protein whose expression level is often low in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) cells due to the BNIP3 gene promoter DNA methylation by DNA methyltransferase ( DNMT ) . It is known that chemotherapy and radiotherapy suppress CRC through inducing tumor apoptosis . However , the molecular mechanisms underlying chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced apoptosis of CRC cells are not well defined . In this study , we observed that the expression level of BNIP3 in colon cancer cells was significantly increased by treatment with therapeutic agents and radiation in vitro . The BNIP3 protein level in CRC tissues from patients who received preoperative concurrent chemotherapy was significantly higher than in those who received surgery alone . Furthermore , treatment with chemotherapeutic agents and radiation significantly decreased the DNMT1 expression level and enzymatic activity . Both expression level and activity of DNMT1 were inversely correlated with the expression level of BNIP3 in colon carcinoma cells after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents and radiation . Consistent with increased BNIP3 expression , chemotherapeutic agents and radiation induced colon carcinoma cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner . Based on these observations , we conclude that chemotherapy and radiotherapy inhibit DNMT1 expression to upregulate BNIP3 expression to promote CRC cell apoptosis . And , BNIP3 may play a role in the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathways , mainly during treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
In the present study , post-treatment effects of dietary turmeric on markers related to apoptosis , cell proliferation , and inflammation in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene ( DMBA)-induced hamster buccal pouch ( HBP ) tumors were investigated . Tumors were induced by applying 0.5% DMBA topically to the HBP three times per week for 12 weeks . After tumor development , half of the animals continued on the control diet and the other half were shifted to a 1% turmeric diet for 4 weeks . To rule out DMBA discontinuation as a cause of inhibition in tumor growth , DMBA treatment was continued during dietary exposure of turmeric in another set of animals until the end of the experiment . The turmeric diet inhibited tumor growth in animals with or without DMBA carcinogen treatment compared to the animals on the control diet . When compared to hamsters bearing tumors that remained on the control diet , the buccal pouches of hamsters bearing tumors receiving turmeric showed the following results : ( 1 ) decreased cell proliferation ( diminished PCNA , cyclin D1 , and Bcl-2 ) and PCNA labelling index , ( 2 ) enhanced apoptosis ( increased Bax , caspase-3 , caspase-9 , and cytochrome c , and decreased survivin ) and apoptotic index , ( 3 ) decreased inflammation ( decreased Cox-2 ) , and ( 4 ) decreased MAPK activation ( p-ERK and p-p38 ) . These data indicate that tumor growth decreased due to the modulation of cellular pathways associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis .
We have previously shown that the antiprogestin and antiglucocorticoid mifepristone inhibits the growth of ovarian cancer cells . In this work , we hypothesized that cellular stress caused by mifepristone is limited to cytostasis and that cell killing is avoided as a consequence of the persistent activity of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway.To investigate the role of this pathway in mifepristone-induced growth inhibition , human ovarian cancer cells of various histological subtypes and genetic backgrounds were exposed to cytostatic doses of mifepristone in the presence or absence of the PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 . The activation of Akt in ovarian cancer cells , as marked by its phosphorylation on Ser473 , was not modified by cytostatic concentrations of mifepristone , but it was blocked upon treatment with LY294002 . The combination mifepristone/LY294002 , but not the individual drugs , killed ovarian cancer cells via apoptosis , as attested by genomic DNA fragmentation and cleavage of caspase-3 , and the concomitant down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and XIAP . From a pharmacological standpoint , when assessing cell growth inhibition using a median-dose analysis algorithm , the interaction between mifepristone and LY294002 was synergistic . The lethality caused by the combination mifepristone/LY294004 in two dimensional cell cultures was recapitulated in organized , tri-dimensional spheroids . This study demonstrates that mifepristone and LY294002 , when used individually , cause cell growth arrest , yet when combined , they cause lethality .
HM781-36B is an orally administered pan-human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) inhibitor . To explore the role of pan-HER inhibitor in breast cancer , we investigated the antitumor effect and mechanisms of HM781-36B in breast cancer cell lines . Six breast cancer cell lines ( BT474 , MDA-MB-453 , SK-BR-3 , T47D , MCF-7 , and MDA-MB-231 ) were tested . The growth inhibitory effect was assessed using the tetrazolium bromide [ 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide ] assay . The cell cycle at various concentrations of HM781-36B was analyzed by flow cytometry , and analysis of downstream molecules was performed by western blot analysis . Interaction of HM781-36B with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents was analyzed by combination index using CalcuSyn . The HER2-amplified cells ( SK-BR-3 , BT474 , and MDA-MB-453 ) were sensitive to HM781-36B ( IC50=0.001 mumol/l , 0.0012 mumol/l , and 0.0095 mumol/l , respectively ) . HM781-36B induced G1 arrest and resulted in apoptosis . It reduced the level of p-HER2 , p-AKT , p-ERK , and p-STAT3 . HM781-36B combined with 5-fluorouracil , cisplatin , paclitaxel , or gemcitabine showed a synergistic inhibitory effect on the HER2-amplified and on some of the HER2-nonamplified breast cancer cells . HM781-36B could be a promising treatment for HER2-amplified breast cancer as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic agents and can be a candidate for treatment of HER2-nonamplified breast cancer in combination with cytotoxic agents .
Transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) signaling has been implicated in driving tumor progression and metastasis by inducing stem cell-like features in some human cancer cell lines . In this study , we have utilized a novel murine cell line NMuMG-ST , which acquired cancer stem cell ( CSC ) phenotypes during spontaneous transformation of the untransformed murine mammary cell line NMuMG , to investigate the role of autocrine TGF-beta signaling in regulating their survival , metastatic ability , and the maintenance of cancer stem cell characteristics . We have retrovirally transduced a dominant-negative TGF-beta type II receptor ( DNRII ) into the NMuMG-ST cell to abrogate autocrine TGF-beta signaling . The expression of DNRII reduced TGF-beta sensitivity of the NMuMG-ST cells in various cell-based assays . The blockade of autocrine TGF-beta signaling reduced the ability of the cell to grow anchorage-independently and to resist serum deprivation-induced apoptosis . These phenotypes were associated with reduced levels of active and phosphorylated AKT and ERK , and Gli1 expression suggesting that these pathways contribute to the growth and survival of this model system . More interestingly , the abrogation of autocrine TGF-beta signaling also led to the attenuation of several features associated with mammary stem cells including epithelial-mesenchymal transition , mammosphere formation , and expression of stem cell markers . When xenografted in athymic nude mice , the DNRII cells were also found to undergo apoptosis and induced significantly lower lung metastasis burden than the control cells even though they formed similar size of xenograft tumors . Thus , our results indicate that autocrine TGF-beta signaling is involved in the maintenance and survival of stem-like cell population resulting in the enhanced metastatic ability of the murine breast cancer cells .
As a member of peroxiredoxin ( Prx ) family , PrxIII is predominantly located in mitochondria and plays an important role as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . Since previous reports demonstrated over-expression of PrxIII in cervical cancer , we conducted the present study to investigate the significance of PrxIII in cervical cancer development and/or progression . Cervical cancer cells were cultured from tissues derived from cervical cancer patients . After successful knockdown of PrxIII expression by small interfering RNA , we evaluated ROS level , viable cell number , and apoptosis of cervical cancer cells along with the culture time . The production of ROS was increased in cervical cancer cells as compared with normal cervical epithelia . Knockdown of PrxIII expression induced up-regulation of other Prx members including PrxI , PrxII , and PrxV . ROS level was higher in down-regulated cervical cancer cells than in controls and the difference was increasing with culture time . We also observed increased apoptosis and decreased viable cell number in down-regulated cervical cancer cells . Our results suggest that PrxIII is an indispensable ROS scavenger , which protects tumor cells against oxidative damage and subsequent apoptosis .
The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of rutaecarpine on DNA strand breaks and apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) in murine Hepa-1c1c7 cells . Oxidative DNA damage was estimated by nuclear condensation assessment , fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis , and Comet assay . Rutaecarpine inhibited cell death induced by 500 \u03bcM H2O2 , as assessed by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole ( DAPI ) staining . Treatment with rutaecarpine reduced the number of DNA strand breaks induced by H2O2 , as assessed by DAPI staining and Comet assay , and increased quinone reductase , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , and pAkt protein levels , as assessed by western blotting .
ANXA2 , a member of the annexin family , is overexpressed and plays important roles in tumor development . However , the significance of ANXA2 expression in gastric carcinoma has not been clarified.To elucidate its roles in growth of gastric cancer , ANXA2 expression in SGC-7901 cells was inhibited with a designated siRNA , then cell proliferation , cell cycling , apoptosis and motility were determined by MTT assay , flow cytometry , Hoechst 33342 staining and wound healing assay , respectively . To further assess the behavior of ANXA2 deleted SGC- 7901 cells , changes of microstructures were observed under fluorescence microscopy , laser scanning confocal microscopy and electron microscopy . We found that inhibition of ANXA2 expression caused cell proliferation to decrease significantly with G1 arrest , motility to be reduced with changes in pseudopodia/filopodia structure and F-actin and beta-tubulin expression , and apoptosis to be enhanced albeit without significance . At the same time , ANXA2 deletion resulted in fewer pseudopodia/filopodia , non-stained areas were increased , contact inhibition among cells reappeared , and expression of F-actin and beta-tubulin was decreased , with induction of polymerized disassembled forms . Taken together , these data suggest that ANXA2 overexpression is important to maintain the malignancy of cancer cells , and this member of the annexin family has potential to be considered as a target for the gene therapy of gastric carcinoma .
Our previous study demonstrated that 5-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) administered to mice stimulates oxidative phosphorylation by upregulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV enzyme cytochrome c oxidase ( COX ) . The present study investigated whether ALA disrupts the Warburg effect , which represents a shift in ATP generation from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis , protecting tumor cells against oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis . The human lung carcinoma cell line A549 exposed to ALA exhibited enhanced oxidative phosphorylation , which was indicated by an increase in COX protein expression and oxygen consumption . Furthermore , ALA suppressed glycolysis-mediated acidosis . This normalization of the ATP metabolic pathways significantly increased the generation of superoxide anion radical ( O2\u2022- ) and the functional expression of active caspase-3 , leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis . These data demonstrate that ALA inhibits the Warburg effect and induces cancer cell death . Use of this endogenous compound might constitute a novel approach to cancer therapy .
Ceramide is a sphingolipid metabolite that induces cancer cell death . When C6-ceramide is encapsulated in a nanoliposome bilayer formulation , cell death is selectively induced in tumor models . However , the mechanism underlying this selectivity is unknown . As most tumors exhibit a preferential switch to glycolysis , as described in the " Warburg effect " , we hypothesize that ceramide nanoliposomes selectively target this glycolytic pathway in cancer . We utilize chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) as a cancer model , which has an increased dependency on glycolysis . In CLL cells , we demonstrate that C6-ceramide nanoliposomes , but not control nanoliposomes , induce caspase 3/7-independent necrotic cell death . Nanoliposomal ceramide inhibits both the RNA and protein expression of GAPDH , an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway , which is overexpressed in CLL . To confirm that ceramide targets GAPDH , we demonstrate that downregulation of GAPDH potentiates the decrease in ATP after ceramide treatment and exogenous pyruvate treatment as well as GAPDH overexpression partially rescues ceramide-induced necrosis . Finally , an in vivo murine model of CLL shows that nanoliposomal C6-ceramide treatment elicits tumor regression , concomitant with GAPDH downregulation . We conclude that selective inhibition of the glycolytic pathway in CLL cells with nanoliposomal C6-ceramide could potentially be an effective therapy for leukemia by targeting the Warburg effect .
IL-15 is a pluripotent antiapoptotic cytokine that signals to cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system and is regarded as a highly promising immunomodulatory agent in cancer therapy . Sepsis is a lethal condition in which apoptosis-induced depletion of immune cells and subsequent immunosuppression are thought to contribute to morbidity and mortality . This study tested the ability of IL-15 to block apoptosis , prevent immunosuppression , and improve survival in sepsis . Mice were made septic using cecal ligation and puncture or Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia . The experiments comprised a 2 x 2 full factorial design with surgical sepsis versus sham and IL-15 versus vehicle . In addition to survival studies , splenic cellularity , canonical markers of activation and proliferation , intracellular pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein expression , and markers of immune cell apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry . Cytokine production was examined both in plasma of treated mice and splenocytes that were stimulated ex vivo . IL-15 blocked sepsis-induced apoptosis of NK cells , dendritic cells , and CD8 T cells . IL-15 also decreased sepsis-induced gut epithelial apoptosis . IL-15 therapy increased the abundance of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 while decreasing proapoptotic Bim and PUMA . IL-15 increased both circulating IFN-gamma , as well as the percentage of NK cells that produced IFN-gamma . Finally , IL-15 increased survival in both cecal ligation and puncture and P. aeruginosa pneumonia . In conclusion , IL-15 prevents two immunopathologic hallmarks of sepsis , namely , apoptosis and immunosuppression , and improves survival in two different models of sepsis . IL-15 represents a potentially novel therapy of this highly lethal disorder .
Mutations in the gene encoding cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase ( SOD1 ) have been linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( FALS ) . However the molecular mechanisms of motor neuron death are multi-factorial and remain unclear . Here we examined DNA damage , p53 activity and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells transfected to achieve low-level expression of either wild-type or mutant Gly(93)-->Ala ( G93A ) SOD1 , typical of FALS . DNA damage was investigated by evaluating the levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-oxodGuo ) and DNA strand breaks . Significantly higher levels of DNA damage , increased p53 activity , and a greater percentage of apoptotic cells were observed in SH-SY5Y cells transfected with G93A SOD1 when compared to cells overexpressing wild-type SOD1 and untransfected cells . Western blot , FACS , and confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated that G93A SOD1 is present in the nucleus in association with DNA . Nuclear G93A SOD1 has identical superoxide dismutase activity but displays increased peroxidase activity when compared to wild-type SOD1 . These results indicate that the G93A mutant SOD1 association with DNA might induce DNA damage and trigger the apoptotic response by activating p53 . This toxic activity of mutant SOD1 in the nucleus may play an important role in the complex mechanisms associated with motor neuron death observed in ALS pathogenesis .
BACKGROUND Barrett's esophagus ( BE ) is caused by gastroesophageal reflux with consecutive mucosal inflammation , predisposing patients to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) . We investigated changes in T cell-related mucosal combinatorial molecular protein patterns in both diseases using the novel Multi-Epitope-Ligand-Cartography , a unique robotic whole-cell imaging technology that simultaneously visualizes dozens of proteins in structurally intact tissues and correlates cellular localization of proteins with function . RESULTS Biopsies were taken during endoscopy from BE , EAC , and normal control tissue , and proteomic microscopy was performed on 32 different epitopes . When the significance level was set to p < 0.0005 and the search depth to five antibody combinations , controls and BE can be differentiated by 63 , controls and EAC by 3222 , and BE from EAC by 1521 distinct protein combinations.For example , the number of activated apoptotic naive and memory T cells was significantly increased only in BE , whereas the number of activated apoptotic helper and regulatory T cells was significantly elevated in BE and EAC . In contrast , the number of activated apoptotic cytotoxic T cells was significantly elevated only in EAC . Confirming different pathways in BE and EAC , the number of T lymphocytes with p53 expression and downregulation of bcl2 expression ( CD3+p53+Bcl2-NfkB- ) was significantly increased in EAC compared to BE and controls . Interestingly , the number of precursor T cells ( CD7+ ) was significantly elevated only in EAC . These cells lack Bax and caspase-8 , suggesting impaired apoptosis in the early stages of T cell differentiation . CONCLUSION Proteomic analysis showed for the first time that proteins , which are critically involved in the mucosal immune system of the esophagus , are distinctly expressed in BE and EAC , whereas others are comparably altered in both diseases , suggesting that many pathogenic events might be shared by both diseases . Topological proteomic analysis , therefore , helps us to understand the different pathogenic events in the underlying disease pathways .
The multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib induced a variable but significant decrease of viability in both p53(wild-type) ( EHEB , JVM-2 , JVM-3 ) and p53(mutated) ( MEC-1 , MEC-2 , BJAB ) prolymphocytic B leukemic cells , due to a combination of cell cycle block in G1 and apoptosis . Antibody phospho-kinase array analysis revealed that dasatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of various kinases , including ERK1/2 and p38/MAPK as well as of STAT3 transcription factors , in both p53(wild-type) and p53(mutated) cells . Therefore , dasatinib might offer a novel therapeutic strategy not only for p53(wild-type) , but also for p53(mutated) B malignancies that have the worst prognosis and urgently need innovative therapeutic approaches .
SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 ( SMYD3 ) is a histone methyltransferase that plays an important role in transcriptional regulation in human carcinogenesis . It can specifically methylate histone H3 at lysine 4 and activate the transcription of a set of downstream genes , including several oncogenes ( e.g. , N-myc , CrkL , Wnt10b , RIZ and hTERT ) and genes involved in the control of cell cycle ( e.g. , CyclinG1 and CDK2 ) and signal transduction ( e.g. , STAT1 , MAP3K11 and PIK3CB ) . To determine the effects of SMYD3 over-expression on cell proliferation , we transfected SMYD3 into MDA-MB-231 cells and found that these cells showed several transformed phenotypes as demonstrated by colony growth in soft agar . Besides , we show here that down-regulation of SMYD3 could induce G1-phase cell cycle arrest , indicating the potent induction of apoptosis by SMYD3 knockdown . These results suggest the regulatory mechanisms of SMYD3 on the acceleration of cell cycle and facilitate the development of strategies that may inhibit the progression of cell cycle in breast cancer cells .
Recently , we identified the " apoptotic ring, " containing phosphorylated histone H2AX ( gamma-H2AX ) , as an early chromatin modification during apoptosis . Because gamma-H2AX initiates the DNA damage response ( DDR ) , we tested whether the apoptotic H2AX response leads to the full recruitment of the DDR factors that normally coordinate DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoints . We show that the apoptotic H2AX response does not recruit the DDR factors because MDC1 ( mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 ) , which normally binds to gamma-H2AX in response to DNA damage and amplifies the DDR , is cleaved by caspase-3 . This cleavage separates the BRCT and FHA domains of MDC1 and constitutes a novel mechanism for the inactivation of DNA repair in apoptotic cells . Also , we show that downregulation of MDC1 increases the apoptotic response to TRAIL . Together , these results implicate MDC1 in the cellular apoptotic response .
Isolinderanolide B ( IOB ) , a butanolide extracted from the stems of Cinnamomum subavenium , was investigated for its antiproliferative activity in T24 human bladder cancer cells . To identity the anticancer mechanism of IOB , its effect on apoptosis , cell cycle distribution , and levels of p53 , p21 Waf1/Cip1 , Fas/APO-1 receptor , and Fas ligand was assayed . Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the G0/G1 phase arrest is because of increase in the expression of p21 Waf1/Cip1 . An enhancement in Fas/APO-1 and membrane-bound Fas ligand ( mFasL ) might be responsible for the apoptotic effect induced by IOB . This study reports the novel finding that the induction of p21 Waf1/Cip1 and activity of the Fas/mFas ligand apoptotic system may participate in the antiproliferative activity of IOB in T24 cells .
By using the rat azoxymethane ( AOM)-induced colon carcinogenesis model , which mirrors many clinical features of human colorectal cancer , we examined whether genetic changes occurring early in colonic mucosa are predictive of treatment efficacy . In the present study the administration of the chemopreventive agent lupulone over the course of 7 weeks postinitiation reduced the number of preneoplastic lesions in the colonic mucosa by 50% . At the molecular level we observed the downregulation of genes involved in the inflammatory response , including IL-1beta and TNF-alpha , and of matrix metalloproteinase-7 gene and protein expression . We also observed a substantial upregulation of components of the innate immune system , alpha-defensin-5 and lipocalin 2 . Lupulone induced the expression of apoptosis-related genes and caused a reversal of the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 ( Bcl-2 ; antiapoptotic ) to Bcl-2 associated X protein ( Bax ; proapoptotic ) transcript and protein ratios ( Bcl-2/Bax > 1 in AOM controls and Bcl-2/Bax < 1 in lupulone-treated AOM rats ) . Here , we identify several target genes that could be considered early biomarkers of colon carcinogenesis and indicative of drug efficacy .
