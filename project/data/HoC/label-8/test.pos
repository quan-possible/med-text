This is a case report of a 69-year-old woman with sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , which was diagnosed clinically as hemangioma . She was first admitted to our university hospital , complaining of general fatigue in December , 1988 , and cholelithiasis and liver cirrhosis with hepatic tumor in Segment 8 were diagnosed . The serum AFP level was within normal range , and the tumor was diagnosed as hemangioma radiologically . She underwent only cholecystectomy and was well without any therapy for the liver tumor up until March in 1991 when she was readmitted to our university hospital due to rapidly progressive liver dysfunction . The size of the liver tumor was unchanged . Despite intensive care , she died of hepatic failure due to cirrhosis in a decompensation state . At autopsy , a well defined yellowish white tumor of 3 cm in maximum diameter was seen in the cirrhotic liver . Although the largest part of the tumor revealed necrosis and hyalinization , a sarcomatoid part composed of spindle-shaped cells was noted in the peripheral portion . In addition , some necrotic ghost cells , probably hepatocellular carcinoma , were also noted . Low molecular cytokeratin , which is always found in HCCs , was seen in spindle-shaped sarcomatoid cells . The liver tumor was diagnosed as sarcomatoid HCC from these pathological findings . We report this histologically unusual HCC with an immunohistochemical study .
PURPOSE We recently reported that overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) positively correlated with radioresistance of murine carcinomas . Because cyclin D1 is a downstream sensor of EGFR activation , the present study investigated whether a relationship exists between the extent of cyclin D1 expression and in vivo radiocurability of murine tumors . We further investigated the influence of radiation on cyclin D1 expression and the expression of p27 , an inhibitor of the cyclin D1 downstream pathway , as well as the relationship of these molecular determinants to cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in tumors exposed to radiation . METHODS AND MATERIALS Cyclin D1 expression was assayed in nine carcinomas syngeneic to C3Hf/Kam mice using Western blot analysis . These tumors greatly differed in their radioresponse as assessed by TCD(50) . The expression of cyclin D1 and p27 proteins was determined by Western blotting . Cell proliferative activity in tumors was determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) immunochemistry . The effect of irradiation on the expression of cyclin D1 or p27 proteins and on PCNA positivity was determined in the radiosensitive OCa-I and in the radioresistant SCC-VII tumors . RESULTS Cyclin D1 expression varied among tumors by 40-fold , and its magnitude positively correlated with poorer tumor radioresponse ( higher TCD(50) values ) . The level of cyclin D1 expression paralleled that of EGFR . A 15-Gy dose reduced constitutive expression of cyclin D1 in the radiosensitive OCa-I tumors , but had no influence on expression of cyclin D1 in the radioresistant SCC-VII tumors . In contrast , 15 Gy increased the expression of p27 in radiosensitive tumors and reduced it in radioresistant tumors . Radiation induced no significant apoptosis or change in the percentage of PCNA-positive ( proliferating ) cells in SCC-VII tumors with high cyclin D1 levels , but it induced significant apoptosis and a decrease in the percentage of proliferating cells in OCa-I tumors with low cyclin D1 expression . CONCLUSION Our findings show a positive correlation between cyclin D1 expression and tumor radioresistance . The expression of cyclin D1 and p27 was modified by radiation and was associated with cellular response to radiation , but this depended on the pretreatment level of cyclin D1 expression . These findings may have important clinical implications : The pretreatment assessment of cyclin D1 expression could serve as a useful predictor of radiotherapy outcome and assist in selecting an effective treatment modality .
Notch signaling controls cell fate decisions of hematopoietic progenitors by inhibiting certain steps of differentiation and inducing either self-renewal or differentiation toward lymphoid or myeloid lineages . In addition , truncated Notch1 alleles could be associated with 10% of all cases of human T lymphoblastic leukemia and , when introduced into mouse bone marrow stem cells , cause T-cell neoplasms . However , functional links between the abundant expression of intact Notch1 and oncogenesis are still lacking . Here we show that Notch1 is highly expressed in B- and T-cell-derived tumor cells of Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma . We demonstrate a novel mechanism for the oncogenic capacity of Notch1 by showing that the interaction between intact Notch1 on tumor cells and its ligand Jagged1 dramatically induces proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis in vitro . We further provide evidence that in Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma , Jagged1 is expressed in malignant and in bystander cells colocalizing with Notch1-positive tumor cells . Notch1 signaling may therefore be activated in tumor cells by Jagged1 through homotypic or heterotypic cell-cell interactions , and it seems likely that these interactions contribute to lymphomagenesis in vivo . Thus , our data suggest that activated Notch1 signaling plays an important role in the pathobiology of Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma and that it might be a potential new target for treatment .
p53 and INK4a/ARF mutations promote tumorigenesis and drug resistance , in part , by disabling apoptosis . We show that primary murine lymphomas also respond to chemotherapy by engaging a senescence program controlled by p53 and p16(INK4a) . Hence , tumors with p53 or INK4a/ARF mutations-but not those lacking ARF alone-respond poorly to cyclophosphamide therapy in vivo . Moreover , tumors harboring a Bcl2-mediated apoptotic block undergo a drug-induced cytostasis involving the accumulation of p53 , p16(INK4a) , and senescence markers , and typically acquire p53 or INK4a mutations upon progression to a terminal stage . Finally , mice bearing tumors capable of drug-induced senescence have a much better prognosis following chemotherapy than those harboring tumors with senescence defects . Therefore , cellular senescence contributes to treatment outcome in vivo .
Elevated insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1 ( IGFBP-rP1 ) mRNA in senescent human mammary epithelial cells suggested that the IGFBP-3 gene product may inhibit cell proliferation . To test this hypothesis , we used a retroviral vector to express IGFBP-rP1 cDNA in the IGFBP-rP1-deficient MCF-7 breast cancer cell line . Compared with control vector-transduced cells , cumulative cell numbers for IGFBP-rP1-transduced polyclonal or clonal cell cultures were reduced by 39 and 74% , respectively , after 1 week . Medium conditioned by IGFBP-rP1-producing cultures reduced cumulative cell numbers in parental MCF-7 cultures by 20% compared with medium from cultures of a control vector-transduced cell line . Nuclear fragmentation analysis and cell proliferation assays completed in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone excluded apoptosis as the responsible mechanism . The percentage of cells containing senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity was doubled compared with control cell cultures . Flow cytometry analysis indicated that twice as many noncycling cells were present in the IGFBP-rP1-transduced MCF-7 cell cultures compared with controls . These findings indicate that IGFBP-rP1 is an inhibitor of MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation and may act via a cellular senescence-like mechanism .
A persistent immune response to hepatitis viruses is a well-recognized risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma . However , the molecular and cellular basis for the procarcinogenic potential of the immune response is not well defined . Here , using a unique animal model of chronic hepatitis that induces hepatocellular carcinogenesis , we demonstrate that neutralization of the activity of Fas ligand prevented hepatocyte apoptosis , proliferation , liver inflammation , and the eventual development of hepatocellular carcinoma . The results indicate that Fas ligand is involved not only in direct hepatocyte killing but also in the process of inflammation and hepatocellular carcinogenesis in chronic hepatitis . This is the first demonstration that amelioration of chronic inflammation by some treatment actually caused reduction of cancer development .
We have previously reported that stressed apoptotic tumor cells are more immunogenic in vivo than nonstressed ones . Using confocal microscopy we have confirmed our previous observation that heat-stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 leukemia cells ( BCR-ABL(+) ) express HSP60 and HSP72 on their surface . To explore how the immune system distinguishes stressed from nonstressed apoptotic tumor cells , we analyzed the responses of dendritic cells to these 2 types of apoptotic cells . We found that nonstressed and heat-stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells were taken up by dendritic cells in a comparable fashion . However , when stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells were coincubated with immature dendritic cells for 24 hours , this resulted in greater up-regulation of costimulatory molecules ( CD40 , CD80 , and CD86 ) on the surface of dendritic cells . Moreover , stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells were more effective in stimulating dendritic cells to secrete interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) and in enhancing their immunostimulatory functions in mixed leukocyte reactions . Furthermore , we demonstrated that immunization of mice with stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells induced the secretion of T helper-1 ( T(H)1 ) profile of cytokines by spleen cells . Splenocytes from mice immunized with stressed apoptotic cells , but not nonstressed ones , were capable of lysing 12B1-D1 and the parental 12B1 line , but not a B-cell leukemia line , A20 . Our data indicate that stressed apoptotic tumor cells are capable of providing the necessary danger signals , likely through increased surface expression of heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) , resulting in activation/maturation of dendritic cells and , ultimately , the generation of potent antitumor T-cell responses .
PURPOSE To investigate treatment of human pancreatic cancer cell lines and xenografts with combinations of Erbitux ( IMC-C225 ) anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) antibody , gemcitabine , and radiation . METHODS AND MATERIALS BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 human pancreatic carcinoma cells were treated in vitro for 24 h with IMC-C225 ( 5 microg/mL ) , then exposed to epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) ( 10 mM ) for 5 min . Immunoblots were screened for EGFR expression and the ability of IMC-C225 to block EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR . Cells were treated with IMC-C225 ( 5 microg/mL ) on Day 0 , the IC(50) dose of gemcitabine on Day 1 for 24 h , followed by 3 Gy 60Co irradiation on Day 2 , or the combination of each agent . For cell proliferation , cells were counted on Day 4 , and for apoptosis , cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide , then analyzed by FACS . Cells were treated with the same single or multiple treatments and analyzed in a clonogenic cell survival assay . The effect of IMC-C225 , gemcitabine , and radiation on the growth of BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 tumor xenografts was determined . Athymic nude mice bearing established s.c. tumor xenografts of 6-8 mm diameter received 6 weeks of treatment with IMC-C225 ( 1 mg every 3 days x 6 ) alone or in combination with gemcitabine ( 120 mg/kg i.v. every 6 days x 6 ) , and 6 weekly fractions of 3 Gy radiation on the days after gemcitabine administration . Tumor growth was measured with Vernier calipers . RESULTS BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 cell lines expressed low levels of EGFR . IMC-C225 inhibited EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor on both cell lines . Treatment of cells with a combination of IMC-C225 + gemcitabine + radiation produced the highest induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation in vitro . Combination treatment with IMC-C225 , gemcitabine , and radiation produced 100% complete regression of MiaPaCa-2 tumors for more than 250 days , and the greatest growth inhibition of BxPC-3 tumors compared to any single or dual treatments . CONCLUSIONS The IMC-C225 therapy in combination with gemcitabine chemotherapy and radiation therapy demonstrated statistically significantly greater efficacy over the single and double combination therapies . This form of multimodality treatment shows potential clinical application in the treatment of pancreatic cancer in humans .
Recent studies have shown that the transcription factor , nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , regulates critical survival pathways in a variety of different cell types , including human pancreatic cancer cells . The activation of NF-kappaB is controlled by proteasome-mediated degradation of its endogenous polypeptide inhibitor , inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaBalpha . We investigated the effects of PS-341 , a peptide boronate inhibitor of the proteasome in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo . Comparison of PS-341's effects on the growth of eight different human pancreatic cancer cell lines revealed marked heterogeneity in drug responsiveness , ranging from highly resistant ( IC50 > 10 microM ; Panc-48 , HS766T , and Mia-PaCa-2 ) to extremely sensitive ( IC50 < 40 nM ; L3.6pl , Hpaf2 , and BxPC3 ) . However , these effects did not correlate with differential inhibition of NF-kappaB activation . Direct quantification of apoptosis revealed that PS-341's effects on cell growth largely correlated with sensitivity to programmed cell death . Evaluation of PS-341's effects on established orthotopic tumor xenografts demonstrated that biweekly intravenous administration of the maximum-tolerated dose of the drug ( 1 mg/kg ) led to significant reductions in the volumes of L3.6pl tumors but not Mia-PaCa-2 tumors . Laser scanning cytometer-mediated quantification of drug-induced apoptosis in the xenografts confirmed that PS-341 induced DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase-3 in L3.6pl tumors but not in Mia-PaCa-2 tumors . However , histological examination of drug-treated tumors revealed extensive central necrosis and reductions in microvessel density and VEGF expression in both tumor types . Taken together , our results demonstrate that PS-341 inhibits the growth of human pancreatic tumors via direct effects on tumor cells and indirect effects on the tumor vasculature .
Despite experimental evidence that sulforaphane can exert chemopreventive effects , whether these effects are specific for neoplastic cells is not known . Following our previous demonstration that sulforaphane induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human T lymphoblastoid Jurkat leukemia cells and increases p53 and bax protein expression , we tested sulforaphane on non-transformed phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes . Here , we demonstrate that sulforaphane arrested cell cycle progression in G , phase , through a decrease in the protein expression of cyclin D3 . Moreover , sulforaphane induced apoptosis ( and also necrosis ) , mediated by an increase in the expression of p53 . These findings suggest that sulforaphane is a growth modulator for T cells . Our in vitro evidence that sulforaphane is active and even cytotoxic in normal as well as transformed lymphocytes raises important questions regarding its suitability for cancer chemoprevention .
Epidemiological studies suggest that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) may influence breast cancer progression and prognosis . In order to study potential mechanisms of action of fatty acid modulation of tumor growth , we studied , in vitro , the influence of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on proliferation , cell cycle , differentiation and apoptosis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells . Both eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) inhibited the MCF-7 cell growth by 30% and 54% , respectively , while linoleic acid ( LA ) had no effect and arachidonic acid ( AA ) inhibited the cell growth by 30% ( p < 0.05 ) . The addition of vitamin E ( 10uM ) to cancer cells slightly restored cell growth . The incubation of MCF-7 cells with PUFAs did not alter the cell cycle parameters or induce cell apoptosis . However , the growth inhibitory effects of EPA , DHA and AA were associated with cell differentiation as indicated by positive Oil-Red-O staining of the cells . Lipid droplet accumulation was increased by 65% , 30% and 15% in the presence of DHA , EPA and AA , respectively ; ( p < 0.05 ) . These observations suggest that fatty acids may influence cellular processes at a molecular level , capable of modulating breast cancer cell growth .
To investigate whether the Bcl-2 gene family is involved in modulating mechanism of apoptosis and change of cell cycle protein induced by curcumin in acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell line and primary acute myelogenous leukemic cells , the Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 , Bax and Bak and cell cycle proteins including P27kipl , P21wafl , cyclin D3 and pRbp- were selected and their expression detected by SABC immuno-histochemical stain method . The attitude of sub-G1 peak in DNA histogram was determined by FCM . The TUNEL positive cell percentage was identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TdT)-mediated Biotin dUNP end labeling technique . It was found that when HL-60 cells were treated with 25 mumol/L curcumin for 24 h , the expression level of Mcl-1 was down-regulated , but that of Bax and Bak up-regulated time-dependently . There was significant difference in the expression level of Mcl-1 , Bax and Bak between the curcumin-treated groups and control group ( P < 0.05-0.01 ) . At the same time , curcumin had no effect on progress of cell cycle in primaty acute myelogenous leukemia at newly diagnosis , but could increase the peak of Sub-G1 ( P < 0.05 ) , and down-regulate the expression of Mcl-1 and up-regulate the expression of Bax and Bak with the difference being statistically significant . The expression of P27kipl , P21wafl and pRbp- were elevated and that of cyclin D3 decreased in the presence of curcumin . These findings suggested that the Bcl-2 gene family indeed participated in the regulatory process of apoptosis induced by curcumin in HL-60 cells and AML cells . Curcumin can induce apoptosis of primary acute myelogenous leukemic cells and disturb cell cycle progression of HL-60 cells . The mechanism appeared to be mediated by perturbing G0/G1 phases checkpoints which associated with up-regulation of P27kipl , P21wafl and pRbp- expression , and down-regulation of cyclin D3 .
To evaluate the effects of adenovirus ( Ad)-mediated transfer of p53 and p16 on human bladder cancer cells EJ , EJ were transfected with Ad-p53 and Ad-p16 . Cell growth , morphological change , cell cycle , apoptosis were measured using MTT assay , flow cytometry , cloning formation , immunocytochemical assays . Ad-p16 or Ad-p53 alone could inhibit the proliferating activity of EJ cells in vitro . Ad-p53 could induce apoptosis of partial EJ cells . G1 arrest was observed 72 h after infection with Ad-p16 , but apoptosis was not obvious . The transfer of Ad-p16 and Ad-p53 could significantly inhibit the growth of EJ cells , decrease the cloning formation rate and induce apoptosis of large number of EJ cells . The occurrence time of subcutaneous tumor was delayed and the tumor volume in 4 weeks was diminished by using Ad-p53 combined with Ad-p16 and the difference was significant compared with using Ad-p53 or Ad-p16 alone . It was suggested that the transfer of wild-type p53 and p16 could significantly inhibit the growth of human bladder cancer in vitro and in vivo .
Previous experiments have shown that emodin is highly active in suppressing the proliferation of several tumor cell lines . However , it is not clear that emodin can induce growth inhibition of hepatoma cells . We have found that emodin induces apoptotic responses in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines ( HCC ) Mahlavu , PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 . The addition of emodin to these three cell lines led to inhibition of growth in a time- and dose-dependent manner . Emodin generated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in these cells which brought about a reduction of the intracellular mitochondrial transmembrane potential ( DeltaPsim ) , followed by the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 , leading to DNA fragmentation and apoptosis . Our findings demonstrate that ROS and the resulting oxidative stress play a pivotal role in apoptosis . Preincubation of hepatoma cell lines with the hydrogen peroxide-scavenging enzyme , catalase ( CAT ) and cyclosporin A ( CsA ) , partially inhibited apoptosis . These results demonstrate that enhancement of generation of ROS , DeltaPsim disruption and caspase activation may be involved in the apoptotic pathway induced by emodin .
Investigation has been conducted to delineate the action of some phenolic compounds of natural origin in four human tumor cell lines : acute myeloblastic leukemia ( HL-60 ) , chronic myelogenic leukemia ( K-562 ) , breast adenocarcinoma ( MCF-7 ) and cervical epithelial carcinoma ( HeLa ) . In cells grown in appropriate media the phenolics curcumin , yakuchinone B , resveratrol and capsaicin exhibited growth inhibition as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion . It was evident from the results of the MTT reduction assay and [ (3)H]thymidine incorporation into nuclear DNA that the phenolics were cytotoxic and inhibited cell proliferation . Dose response studies indicated curcumin to be most cytotoxic towards HL-60 , K-562 and MCF-7 but did not show much activity in HeLa cells . On the other hand , yakuchinone B , although less active than curcumin , displayed cytotoxicity towards all four cell lines . Resveratrol was cytotoxic only in leukemic cells , while capsaicin was marginally cytotoxic . All these phenolics did not elicit any cytotoxic activity as judged by the above parameters towards lymphocytes purified from normal human blood . When cells treated with phenolics were stained with propidium iodide and examined under a fluorescent microscope , characteristic apoptotic features such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were observed . Scoring of cells with apoptotic and non-apoptotic features showed positive correlation of apoptotic index with dose of phenolic , and fragmented DNA extracted free of genomic DNA displayed on gel electrophoresis a typical ladder pattern . These phenolics which have human exposure are known cancer chemopreventive agents and their action as inducers of apoptosis in tumor cells suggest their potential use in a strategy for cancer control .
Hexavalent chromium ( Cr(VI) ) compounds are known human carcinogens associated with the incidence of lung cancer . Although a direct correlation between Cr(VI) exposure and lung cancer has been established , several studies aimed at generating animal models for Cr(VI) have yielded inconsistent data that do not affirmatively support findings from epidemiologic studies . Because the lack of a good animal model has hindered the identification of molecular mechanisms involved in Cr(VI) exposure , we developed an in vitro model that facilitates mechanistic studies of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis . We report here that long-term exposure to Cr(VI) leads to the malignant transformation of nontumorigenic human lung epithelial cells . Cr(VI)-transformed cells exhibited loss of contact inhibition , colony formation , and increased rates of cell invasion , migration , and proliferation , as compared with passage-matched control cells . Cr(VI)-transformed cells evaded apoptosis by a mechanism involving S-nitrosylation and stabilization of Bcl-2 protein in a nitric oxide-dependent manner . This study establishes an important in vitro model that facilitates mechanistic studies of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis , and elucidates a novel mechanism that causes apoptosis-resistant malignant transformation of nontumorigenic lung cells in response to a human carcinogen .
Cantharidin is an active constituent of mylabris , a traditional Chinese medicine . It is a potent and selective inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) that plays an important role in control of cell cycle , apoptosis , and cell-fate determination . Owing to its antitumor activity , cantharidin has been frequently used in clinical practice . In the present study , we investigated the therapeutic potential of cantharidin in pancreatic cancer . Cantharidin efficiently inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cells , but presented a much lighter toxicity effect against normal pancreatic duct cells . It caused G2/M cell-cycle arrest that was accompanied by the down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( CDK1 ) and up-regulation of p21 expression . It induced apoptosis and elevated the expressions of pro-apoptotic factors tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , TNF-related apoptosis inducing receptor 1 ( TRAILR1 ) , TRAILR2 , Bad , Bak , and Bid , and decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 . Activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 suggested that both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are involved in the induction of apoptosis . Interestingly , unlike previous studies on other cancer cells , we found that the inhibitory role of cantharidin is independent of oxidative stress in pancreatic cancer cells . Mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , including ERK , JNK , and p38 , were activated after treatment with cantharidin . Inhibition of JNK , but not ERK or p38 , alleviated the cytotoxity effect of cantharidin , suggesting cantharidin exerted its anticancer effect through the JNK-dependent way . Hence , in addition to being an attractive candidate compound with therapeutic potential , cantharidin also highlighted the possibility of using PP2A as a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer treatment .
BACKGROUND The current staging system provides an anatomical classification of lung tumors ; its secondary purpose is to allow the prognostic stratification of patients into homogeneous groups after surgery . In this work , intratumoral perineural invasion , lymphatic and blood vessel invasion together with the necrosis content of the tumor exclusive of the non-small cell cancer staging system were studied . METHODS During a 4-year period , 152 patients operated for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) at our hospital were analyzed . Mean age of patients was 55.7 +/- 10.1 years . RESULTS Overall 5-year survival was 42.2 % . Mediastinal lymph node involvement , tumor size , incomplete resection , pneumonectomy , presence of necrosis and perineural invasion were significant prognosticators ( P = 0.03 , 0.04 , 0.0001 , 0.046 , 0.0246 , < 0.0001 , respectively ) . Multivariate analysis revealed that N status , perineural invasion , and the presence of necrosis were independent prognostic factors ( P = 0.006 , P = 0.001 , P = 0.001 , respectively ) . Patients who had stage I tumor with necrosis and perineural invasion had a lower survival rate than those with stage IIIA tumor without these histopathological features ( P = 0.04 ) . The presence of these histopathological characteristics in stage IIIA patients was a sign of a poorer prognosis ( P = 0.0001 ) . CONCLUSIONS Perineural invasion and the presence of necrosis independently indicated a dismal prognosis and their prognostic power is comparable to those of the TNM classification . These factors could be candidates for better survival stratification and the indicators of the need for adjuvant therapy in early stage lung cancer patients .
PURPOSE Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 ( PKM2 ) is a key enzyme in aerobic glycolysis ; inhibition of PKM2 leads to the tumor growth inhibition . In this study , the effects of combined treatment with cisplatin ( DDP ) and a plasmid that expresses a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) targeting PKM2 on the growth of human A549 xenograft lung cancer model were investigated . METHODS The expression of PKM2 in A549 cells was determined by immunofluorescence . PKM2 expression levels were evaluated by Western blot analysis . In a human A549 lung cancer xenograft model , the effects of treatment with shRNA , with or without cisplatin , on tumor volume were determined . Apoptosis and cell proliferation status were examined to determine the mechanisms of tumor growth inhibition . RESULTS Expression of shRNA targeting PKM2 resulted in inhibition of PKM2 expression in A549 cells . In the lung cancer xenograft model , average tumor volume in the group treated with both cisplatin and shRNA was statistically lower than those of other groups ( P < 0.05 ) . The levels of apoptotic cells were significantly higher in samples from animals in the combined treatment group than those from untreated animals ( P < 0.05 ) . The cell proliferation rate , as determined by counting cells labeled with an anti-phospho-histone H3 , a marker for mitosis , was lower in samples from animals treated with both cisplatin and shRNA than in samples from other groups ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS Use of RNA interfering ( RNAi ) targeting PKM2 significantly inhibited tumor growth when combined with cisplatin in a human A549 lung cancer xenograft model . The enhanced antitumor activity of the combined treatment compared to treatment with shRNA alone may result in part from increased induction of apoptosis and augmented inhibition of cancer cell proliferation .
Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) and agonistic anti-DR4/TRAIL-R1 and anti-DR5/TRAIL-R2 antibodies are currently under clinical investigation for treatment of different malignancies . TRAIL activates DR4 and DR5 and thereby triggers apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling pathways , but possible different roles of DR4 or DR5 in these responses has poorly been addressed so far . In the present work , we analyzed cell viability , DISC formation as well as IL-8 and NF-kappaB activation side by side in responses to TRAIL and agonistic antibodies against DR4 ( mapatumumab ) and against DR5 ( lexatumumab ) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells . We found that all three reagents are able to activate cell death and pro-inflammatory signaling . Death-inducing signaling complex ( DISC ) analysis revealed that mapatumumab and lexatumumab induce formation of homocomplexes of either DR4 or DR5 , whereas TRAIL additionally stimulated the formation of heterocomplexes of both receptors . Notably , blocking of receptors using DR4- and DR5-specific Fab fragments indicated that TRAIL exerted its function predominantly via DR4 . Interestingly , inhibition of PKC by Goe6983 enabled DR5 to trigger apoptotic signaling in response to TRAIL and also strongly enhanced lexatumumab-mediated cell death . Our results suggest the existence of mechanisms that silence DR5 for TRAIL- but not for agonistic-antibody treatment .
MG132 , as a proteasome inhibitor , can induce apoptotic cell death through formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . In this study , we investigated the effects of MAPK ( MEK , JNK , and p38 ) inhibitors on MG132-treated A549 lung cancer cells in relation to cell growth , cell death , ROS , and glutathione ( GSH ) levels . Treatment with 10 microM MG132 inhibited the growth of A549 cells at 24 h . MG132 also induced apoptosis , which was accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP ; deltapsi(m) ) . ROS were not increased in MG132-treated A549 cells . MG132 increased GSH-depleted cell numbers and decreased GSH levels . MEK and JNK inhibitors did not strongly affect cell growth , cell death , ROS , and GSH levels in MG132-treated A549 cells . In contrast , p38 inhibitor reduced cell growth inhibition , apoptosis , and MMP ( deltapsi(m) ) loss by MG132 . However , p38 inhibitor did not change ROS level and GSH content . In conclusion , MG132 inhibited the growth of A549 cells via apoptosis without formation of ROS . Treatment with p38 inhibitor rescued some cells from MG132-induced apotposis , which was not affected by ROS and GSH level changes .
BACKGROUND AND AIM The importance of glycolysis in cancer cells is well documented . The effects of inhibiting glycolysis using metabolic inhibitors iodoacetate ( IAA ) , an inhibitor of GAPDHase , and 3-bromopyruvate ( 3BP ) , an inhibitor of hexokinase-II , on survival and signaling of pancreatic cancer cells ( Panc-1 ) were investigated . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cellular survival was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay . Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) assay was used to analyze the induced necrosis and protein levels were evaluated using Western blot analysis . RESULTS The results show that the inhibitors lowered cellular survival and increased cellular necrosis . Mitogenic signaling pathways were affected by 3BP but not by IAA . CONCLUSION We conclude that there may be a cross-talk between signaling pathways and glycolysis in regulating pancreatic cancer cell survival and signaling . Thus , a combination of agents that inhibit both energy production and cell signaling may provide a novel and effective approach to target pancreatic cancer effectively .
The hypoxic tumor microenvironment is associated with malignant progression and poor treatment response . The glucose transporter Glut-1 is a prognostic factor and putative hypoxia marker . So far , studies of Glut-1 in cancer have utilized conventional immunohistochemical analysis in a series of individual biopsy or surgical specimens . Tissue microarrays , however , provide a rapid , inexpensive means of profiling biomarker expression . To evaluate hypoxia markers , tissue cores must show the architectural features of hypoxia ; i.e. viable tissue surrounding necrotic regions . Glut-1 may be a useful biomarker to validate tissue microarrays for use in studies of hypoxia-regulated genes in cancer . In this study , we carried out immunohistochemical detection of Glut-1 protein in many tumor and normal tissue types in a range of tissue microarrays . Glut-1 was frequently found in peri-necrotic regions , occurring in 9/34 lymphomas , 6/12 melanomas , and 5/16 glioblastomas ; and in 43/54 lung , 22/84 colon , and 23/60 ovarian tumors . Expression was rare in breast ( 6/40 ) and prostate ( 1/57 ) tumors , and in normal tissue , was restricted to spleen , tongue , and CNS endothelium . In conclusion , tissue microarrays enable the observation of Glut-1 expression in peri-necrotic regions , which may be linked to hypoxia , and reflect previous studies showing differential Glut-1 expression across tumor types and non-malignant tissue .
BACKGROUND/AIMS The use of chemotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma is still controversial . The aim of this study was to investigate whether the combined use of epirubicin and progesterone has a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis in HepG2 cells . METHODOLOGY Different concentrations of epirubicin ( 0.1 microg/ml , 0.25 microg/ml and 0.5microg/ml ) or progesterone ( 12.5 microM , 25 microM and 50 microM ) were added to HepG2 cells either alone or in combinations consisting of different concentrations of the two . Their effects on HepG2 cells were studied by ( 1 ) XTT assay for analysis of cell proliferation , ( 2 ) 3H-Thymidine incorporation for DNA synthesis , ( 3 ) annexin V-FITC/ propidium iodide ( PI ) flowcytometery for cell apoptosis , ( 4 ) flowcytometry for cell cycle distributions , and ( 5 ) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for expression of cell cycle modulator , cyclin D1 . RESULTS 50 microM progesterone increased both the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of 0.1 microg/ml epirubicin on HepG2 cells at 48 hr culture due to 50 microM progesterone accumulated cells in S phase of the cell cycle and subsequently reduced cyclin D1 expression . These effects on HepG2 cells induced by this combination were comparable to those induced by 0.5 microg/ml epirubicin alone . CONCLUSIONS In vitro , progesterone can increase the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by epirubicin on HepG2 cells .
Recent research has shown that the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit is a novel anti-cancer target , which plays pivotal roles in malignant cell ion transport , metabolism , migration and signal transduction . The purpose of the present study was to investigate the anti-cancer effects of ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 small interfering ribonucleic acid ( siRNA ) on HepG2 cell proliferation , apoptosis and cell cycle , and to explore the molecular mechanisms . The expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , normal liver tissues and human HCC line ( HepG2 , SMMC-7721 and Bel-7402 ) has been investigated . Using the ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit siRNA , which target the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase , we have evaluated the effects of inhibiting Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 in human HepG2 cells with respect to cell proliferation , morphology , cell cycle , impact on intracellular Ca2++ , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) concentration , and correlated gene expression level on messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) and protein . Our data showed that the expression Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in HCC tissues is higher than that in normal liver tissues . Ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 siRNA could inhibit HepG2 cell proliferation . Ouabain could induce HepG2 cell apoptosis and generate S phase arrest , and siRNA could enhance the anti-cancer effect of ouabain that induced HepG2 cells apoptosis via an intracellular Ca(2+) and ROS increase-mediated , and generated cell cycle S phase arresting by decreasing the CyclinA1/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ( CDK2)/proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) complex product and increasing the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A ( P21(CIP1) ) . We believe that targeting of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in human HCC cells could provide new sight into the treatment of HCC .
A 33-year-old man presented with pain and palsy of the leg in 2008 for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with huge distant metastases . The patient's tumors had slowly enlarged despite several treatments . Oral administration of sorafenib at 800 mg/day with careful observation was commenced in 2009 . Laboratory investigations on day 7 showed massive tumor lysis . An abdominal CT showed multiple low density areas and tumor markers decreased , indicating extended tumor necrosis . In conclusion , clinicians should bear in mind not only the published adverse effects , but also massive tumor lysis , when treating patients with large tumor burden by sorafenib .
Hypoxia is one of the inevitable circumstances of various tumors . It controls various levels of regulation in tumor progression and results in tumor resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy . Here we investigated a synthetic TPZ derivative , N-ethoxymethyl-3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1,4-dioxide ( XQ2 ) , a novel compound that induced anti-cancer effects both in normoxia and in hypoxia , cell proliferation assay found that XQ2 exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on the tested cancer cell lines both in normoxia and in hypoxia . Flow cytometry and western blot studies indicated that XQ2 induces G2/M arrest and a caspase-dependent apoptosis in A549 cells . Additionally , intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) appear to play a key role in the anticancer effect of XQ2 in hypoxia . Taken together , our data suggest that XQ2 exerted anticancer action by suppressing the ROS level and triggering cell-cycle arrest and the caspase-dependent pathway , which is associated with apoptosis .
OBJECTIVE The study was undertaken to document and highlight the shortcomings of histopathology reporting of breast carcinoma in Pakistan so that improvements can be recommended and a standardized protocol devised . METHODS This was a descriptive cross sectional study and was conducted at Histopathology Department , Armed Forces Institute of Pathology , Rawalpindi from 1st January 2008 to 31st October 2008 . Fifty consecutive breast carcinoma reports received for review from different laboratories were analyzed for documentation of patients age , sex , type of procedure/specimen , specimen size , tumour size , invasive tumour type , invasive tumour grade , comment on excision margins , extent of lymph node involvement , insitu component , lymphovascular invasion , necrosis , skin involvement and tabular format . Frequencies and percentages were calculated for presence of these above mentioned variables in different reports , keeping in mind the possible information that could be obtained from a particular sample . RESULTS It was found that the variable least mentioned in the reports was in situ component commented upon in only 23.2% of reports . Necrosis was mentioned in 35% of reports . Tabular format was found in 36% of reports only . CONCLUSION Marked deficiencies are seen in histopathology reports for breast carcinoma due to the lack of any standardized reporting system . Separate checklist formats for trucut biopsies , lumpectomies and mastectomies should be introduced to ensure uniform reporting .
The biological activities of tocotrienols are receiving increasing attention . Herein , we report the efficacy of a mixed-tocotrienol diet against prostate tumorigenesis in the transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate ( TRAMP ) mouse model . Male TRAMP mice , 8 wk old , were fed 0.1% , 0.3% , or 1% mixed tocotrienols in AIN-76A diet up to 24 wk old . Likewise , a positive control group consisting of male TRAMP mice and a negative control group consisting of wild-type nontransgenic mice were fed regular AIN-76A diet up to 24 wk old . Our results show that mixed-tocotrienol-fed groups had a lower incidence of tumor formation along with a significant reduction in the average wet weight of genitourinary apparatus . Furthermore , mixed tocotrienols significantly reduced the levels of high-grade neoplastic lesions as compared to the positive controls . This decrease in levels of high-grade neoplastic lesions was found to be associated with increased expression of proapoptotic proteins BAD ( Bcl(2) antagonist of cell death ) and cleaved caspase-3 and cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 . In contrast , the expression of cyclins A and E were found to be decreased in mixed-tocotrienol groups . Taken together , our results show that by modulating cell cycle regulatory proteins and increasing expression of proapoptotic proteins , mixed tocotrienols suppress prostate tumorigenesis in the TRAMP mice .
AIM To compare the value of intravenous contrast-enhanced ultrasonography ( US ) , intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography ( CT ) , and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas . MATERIAL AND METHODS The study enrolled 48 patients , aged between 20 and 79 years ( 35 [ 72.9% ] women , 13 [ 27.1% ] men ; mean age , 53.5+/-12.855 years ) , who were examined and treated in the Departments of Gastroenterology , Surgery , and Oncology , Hospital of Kaunas University of Medicine , in the year 2007 . All patients underwent intravenous contrast-enhanced US , intravenous contrast-enhanced CT , and MRI and were diagnosed with hepatic hemangioma according to the findings of these examinations . RESULTS The size of hemangiomas was < or =2.0 cm in 20 cases ( 41.7% ) and >2.0 cm in 28 ( 58.3% ) . No association between hepatic hemangioma and patient's age was found ( chi(2)=0.547 , df=2 , P=0.761 ) . Nearly one-third of hemangiomas were located in the segment IV of the left hepatic lobe . There were a few complicated hemangiomas in the study sample : 2 with calcification and 1 with necrosis . The sensitivity of CT in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma was 76.92% ; specificity , 33.3% ; positive prognostic value , 83.3% ; and negative prognostic value , 25.0% . The sensitivity of intravenous contrast-enhanced US in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma was 77.8% ; specificity , 100% ; positive prognostic value , 100% ; and negative prognostic value , 23.1% . CONCLUSIONS Intravenous contrast-enhanced US is more specific than intravenous contrast-enhanced CT in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma ( P=0.0005 ) and has a higher positive prognostic value ( P=0.001 ) .
n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) have a chemopreventive effect while n-6 PUFA promote carcinogenesis . The effect of these essential fatty acids may be related to oxidative stress . Therefore , the study was designed to evaluate the effect of different ratios of fish oil ( FO ) and corn oil ( CO ) in the prevention of colon cancer . Male Wistar rats were divided into control , dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride ( DMH ) treated , FO + CO ( 1:1 ) and FO + CO ( 2.5:1 ) . All the groups , except the control received a weekly injection of DMH for 4 weeks . The animals were sacrificed either 48 h later ( initiation phase ) or kept for 16 weeks ( post initiation phase ) . DMH treatment in the initiation phase animals showed mild to moderate inflammation , decreased ROS and TrxR activity , increased antioxidants , apoptosis and ACF multiplicity . The post initiation study showed severe inflammation with hyperplasia , increased ACF multiplicity and ROS levels , a decrease in antioxidants and apoptosis . The FO + CO ( 1:1 ) treated animals showed severe inflammation , a decrease in ROS , an increase in antioxidants and apoptosis in the initiation phase . FO + CO ( 1:1 ) in the post initiation phase and FO + CO ( 2.5:1 ) in the initiation showed mild inflammation , increased ROS , apoptosis and decreased antioxidants . There was a decrease in ACF multiplicity and ROS levels , increased antioxidants and apoptosis in the post initiation phase study . The present study suggests that FO has a dose- and time-dependent chemopreventive effect in colon cancer mediated through oxidative stress and apoptosis .
BACKGROUND Cisplatin chemotherapy often causes acute kidney injury in cancer patients . The causative mechanisms of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury include renal inflammation , activation of p53 tumour suppressor protein and tubular apoptosis . Luteolin , a flavone found in medicinal herbs and plants , has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory , antioxidant and anticarcinogenic activities . The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-apoptotic effect of luteolin on cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury and the molecular mechanism . METHODS C57BL/6 mice were treated with cisplatin ( 20 mg/kg ) with or without treatment with luteolin ( 50 mg/kg for 3 days ) . Renal function , histological changes , degree of oxidative stress and tubular apoptosis were examined . The effects of luteolin on cisplatin-induced expression of renal p53 , PUMA-alpha and Bcl-2 family proteins were evaluated . RESULTS Treatment of mice with cisplatin resulted in renal damage , showing an increase in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels , tubular damage , oxidative stress and apoptosis . Treatment of cisplatin-treated mice with luteolin significantly improved renal dysfunction , reducing tubular cell damage , oxidative stress and apoptosis . Examination of molecules involving apoptosis of the kidney revealed that treatment of cisplatin increased the levels of p53 and its phosphorylation , PUMA-alpha , Bax and caspase-3 activity that were significantly decreased by treatment with luteolin . CONCLUSION These results indicate that cisplatin induces acute kidney injury by regulation of p53-dependent renal tubular apoptosis and that luteolin ameliorates the cisplatin-mediated nephrotoxicity through down-regulation of p53-dependent apoptotic pathway in the kidney .
Diallyl disulfide ( DADS ) is a major organo-sulfur compound derived from garlic ( Allium sativum ) , which inhibits the proliferation of various types of cancer cells . In this study we investigated the effect of DADS on the induction of apoptosis , as well as its regulatory effect on the activation of transcription factors in B16F-10 melanoma cells . Treatment of B16F-10 cells with nontoxic concentrations of DADS resulted in the presence of apoptotic bodies and induced DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner . Cell-cycle analysis revealed that the occurrence of the sub-G1 peak was significantly elevated in DADS-treated cells . DADS treatment also down-reguated Bcl-2 expression and up-regulated p53 , caspase-9 , and caspase-3 expression in B16F-10 melanoma cells . The study also reveals that DADS inhibited the activation and nuclear translocation of p65 , p50 , and c-Rel subunits of nuclear factor ( NF)-B and other transcription factors , such as c-fos , activated transcription factor-2 , and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein , in B16F-10 melanoma cells The pro-inflammatory cytokine production and gene expression of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)-alpha , interleukin ( IL)-1beta , IL-6 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) were down-regulated in DADS-treated cells compared with control B16F-10 metastatic melanoma cells . DADS induces caspase-dependent apoptosis through a mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway in B16F-10 melanoma cells by activating p53 and caspase-3 gene expression and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-B-mediated Bcl-2 activation .
Overexpression of the melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 ( MDA-7)/IL-24 in vitro generally results in the growth suppression and induction of apoptosis of diverse human tumor cells . In this study , we investigated the effects of overexpression of the MDA-7/IL-24 gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells in vitro and in vivo . Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of MDA-7 facilitated the MDA-7/IL-24-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in HCC cells , but not in the normal liver cell line L02 , and the effect was independent of the p53 status . Inhibition of metastasis and angiogenesis was correlated with decreasing expression of STAT3 , P-STAT3 , MMP-2 , VEGF , and TGF-beta genes , regulated by STAT3 in MHCCLM6 cells . We also showed that Ad.mda-7 combined with doxorubicin ( ADM ) had significantly enhanced antitumor and antimetastatic effects in vivo , accompanied by the downregulation of VEGF , MMP-2 , and TGF-beta genes and the upregulation of E-cadherin genes . These data suggested that MDA-7/IL-24 induces its selective antitumor properties in HCC cells by promoting apoptosis independent of p53 status , inhibiting subcutaneous tumor growth and metastasis , and increasing the effect of chemotherapeutic agents . MDA-7/IL-24 represents a new class of cancer suppressor genes that may be useful in the targeted therapy of HCC .
BACKGROUND Ginkgolic acids ( GAs ) , extracted from the seed coat of Ginkgo biloba L. Our previous study has shown that GA monomer could inhibit the growth of Hep-2 significantly and induce the fragmentation of the chromosomal DNA . To further assess the antitumor potential and turn it into a candidate new antitumor drug , the antitumor mechanism of GA was investigated . METHOD The cytotoxicity and antitumor effect of GA monomer were assayed by MTT colorimetric assay with nontumorogenic MC-3T3-E1 as well as tumorogenic Hep-2 and Tac8113 cell lines . The effect of GA monomer on the proliferation of tumor cell lines was analyzed with MTT colorimetric and CFSE labeled assay . Cell cycle distribution and measurement of the percentage of apoptotic cells were performed by flow cytometry following stained with propidium iodide , annexin V-FITC . The expression of apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 , Bax and caspase-3 was analyzed with Western blot . RESULT GA only inhibited the growth of tumorogenic cell lines in a both dose- and time-dependent manner . Tumor cells were treated with GA for 72 h , 70.53 +/- 4.54% Hep-2 and 63.5 +/- 7.2% Tca8113 cells were retarded at GO/G1 phase , and the percentage of apoptosis was 40.4 +/- 1.58 and 38.4 +/- 1.7% , respectively . GA-treated activated caspase-3 downregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and upregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax protein , eventually leading to a decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in tumor cells . CONCLUSIONS The antitumor action of GA was due to inhibiting the proliferation in a manner of inhibiting division , retarding the progress of cell cycle and inducing apoptosis , making GA a candidate as new antitumor drug .
BACKGROUND Though an increased efficacy of carmustine and temozolomide ( TMZ ) has been demonstrated by inactivation of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) with O(6)-benzyl-guanine ( BG ) in human pancreatic tumors refractive to alkylating agents , the regulatory mechanisms have not been explored . METHODS The effects of TMZ and BG on apoptosis , cell growth , the mitotic index , cell cycle distribution , and protein expression were studied by TUNEL , cell counting , flow cytometry , and Western blot analysis , respectively . RESULTS The wt-p53 human pancreatic tumor cell line Capan-2 and p53-efficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were more responsive to treatment with TMZ + BG than mutant p53 Capan-1 and p53-null MEFs . S phase delay with a subsequent G2/M arrest was observed in Capans in response to BG + TMZ . The G1-to-S transition delay in Capan-2 was associated with p53-dependent apoptosis and was distinctly different from the presumed mismatch repair ( MMR ) killing operative during the G2/M arrest . The effect of p53 on BG + TMZ toxicity was supported by a marked change in apoptosis when p53 function was restored/inactivated . There was an early induction of MMR proteins in p53-efficient lines . CONCLUSION p53 provokes a classic proapoptotic response by delaying G1-to-S progression , but it may also facilitate cell killing by enhancing MMR-related cell cycle arrest and cell death .
Numerous scientific studies have examined the relationship between coffee consumption and an array of medical conditions , including cancer , and yet the direct effect of commercially brewed coffee on cancer cells has not been evaluated . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antiproliferation effect of 4 different regular and decaffeinated coffee brews and 3 of coffee's bioactive ingredients-caffeine , chlorogenic acids , and caffeic acid-on 2 human ovarian cancer cell lines alone and in combination with cisplatin ( CDDP ) . Antiproliferation IC(50) for Brand A regular and decaffeinated coffee on A2780 cells was 1:70.79 +/- 5.66 and 1:55.68 +/- 2.00 dilution ( vol/vol ) in tissue culture medium ( mean +/- standard error of the mean ; N = 12 ) , respectively , and slightly lower on A2780CP70 cells . Three other brands showed lower antiproliferation activity . Antiproliferation IC(50) concentrations of chlorogenic acids and caffeic acid are many folds lower than caffeine . In combination with CDDP , both Brand A coffee brews , and the 3 bioactive compounds , showed additive antiproliferation effect on both cancer cell lines . Flow cytometry analysis showed that coffee treatment induced apoptosis of A2780 and A2780CP70 cells . To our knowledge , this is the first report showing the antiproliferation activity and the additive effect with CDDP of commercially prepared coffee brews on human cancer cell lines .
Cell division and apoptosis are two crucial components of tumor biology and the importance of increased cell proliferation and reduced cell death have made them valid therapeutic targets . The plant kingdom is a relatively underexploited cache of novel drugs , and crude extracts of plants are known for their synergistic activity . The present study assessed the anti-proliferative activity of the medicinal plant Centrosema pubescens Benth . Centrosema pubescens dichloromethane extract ( CPDE ) inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 ( promyelocytic acute leukaemia ) cells with an IC50 value of 5 mug/ml . Further studies also showed that CPDE induces growth arrest at the G1 phase and specifically down-regulates the expressions of cyclin E and CDK2 and up-regulates p27(CKI) levels . These events apparently lead to the induction of apoptosis , which was demonstrated qualitatively by a DNA fragmentation assay and propidium iodide staining . Quantitative assessment of the effective arrest of the cell cycle and of apoptosis was confirmed by flow cytometry . CPDE exhibited negligible cytotoxicity even at the highest dose tested ( 100 mug/ml ) in both normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in an in vitro model ( HL-60 ) . Our results strongly suggest that CPDE arrests the cell cycle at the G1 phase and triggers apoptosis by caspase activation .
We investigated the priming effect and mechanism of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in chemotherapy with low-dose Ara-C and VP-16 for acute myeloid leukemia . We analyzed cell proliferation , apoptosis , and cell cycle in vitro using leukemia cell lines 32Dcl3 , U937 , HL-60 , and Ba/F3 . Cell proliferation assays were performed using the Trypan Blue dye exclusion method . For detection of apoptosis , the Annexin V-binding capacity of treated cells was examined by flow cytometry . To evaluate the cell cycle , we used an FITC BrdU Flow kit and conducted analysis by flow cytometry . The combination of Ara-C and VP-16 significantly enhanced the observed effects compared with those of Ara-C or VP-16 alone . Concurrent administration of G-CSF further reduced the cell number and viability of 32Dcl3 and U937 cells , but not of HL-60 and Ba/F3 cells . Apoptotic cells were significantly increased in number by the addition of G-CSF to 32Dcl3 and U937 cells , while G-CSF had no significant effect on HL-60 and Ba/F3 cell lines . The addition of G-CSF significantly decreased the percentage of G0/G1-phase cells and significantly increased that of S-phase cells among 32Dcl3 and U937 cells . No significant effect was observed for HL-60 and Ba/F3 cells . An enhancement was confirmed for the combination of Ara-C , VP-16 , and G-CSF for 32Dcl3 and U937 cells but not for HL-60 and Ba/F3 cells . It was thought that this difference was a result of different responses to G-CSF . G-CSF potentiates Ara-C- and VP-16-induced cytotoxicities through apoptosis induction by mobilizing resting G0-G1-phase cells into S phase .
Tobacco-induced oxidative stress leads to chronic inflammation and is implicated in the development of many human epithelial cancers , including head and neck cancer . Cigarette smoke exposure was shown to induce the expression of the DeltaNp63alpha and nitric oxide synthase ( NOS)-2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells and immortalized oral keratinocytes . The NOS2 promoter was found to contain various cognate sequences for several transcription factors including interferon regulatory factor ( IRF)-6 and p63 , which were shown in vivo binding to the NOS2 promoter in response to smoke exposure . Small interfering ( si)-RNAs against both DeltaNp63alpha and IRF6 decreased the induction of NOS2 promoter-driven reporter luciferase activity and were shown to inhibit NOS2 activity . Furthermore , both mainstream ( MSE ) and sidestream ( SSE ) smoking extracts induced changes in expression of autophagic marker , LC3B , while siRNA against DeltaNp63alpha , IRF6 and NOS2 modulated these autophagic changes . Overall , these data support the notion that DeltaNp63alpha/IRF6 interplay regulates NOS2 transcription , thereby underlying the autophagic-related cancer cell response to tobacco exposure .
Pegylated Interferon-alpha2b ( pIFN-alpha ) is an integral part of the drug regimen currently employed against melanoma . Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the IFN response , cell cycle and apoptosis . We have studied pIFN-alpha induced responses when combined with the chemotherapy agent , vinblastine in tumor and endothelial cell lines and the connection to IRF-1 signaling . Levels of IRF-1/IRF-2 protein expression were found to be decreased in tumor versus normal tissues. pIFN-alpha induced IRF-1 signaling in human melanoma ( M14 ) and endothelial ( EA.hy926 ) cells and enhanced cell death when combined with vinblastine . Upon combined IFN-alpha and vinblastine treatment , p21 expression , PARP cleavage and activated Bak levels were increased in M14 cells . An increase in p21 and cyclin D1 expression occurred in EA.hy926 cells after 6 h of treatment with pIFN-alpha which dissipated by 24 h . This biphasic response , characteristic of cellular senescence , was more pronounced upon combined treatment . Exposure of the EA.hy926 cells to pIFN-alpha was associated with an enlarged , multinucleated , beta-galactosidase-positive senescent phenotype . The overall therapeutic mechanism of IFN-alpha combined with chemotherapy may be due to both direct tumor cell death via IRF-1 signaling and by premature senescence of endothelial cells and subsequent effects on angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment .
BACKGROUND Hesperidin , a flavanone present in citrus fruits , has been identified as a potent anticancer agent because of its proapoptotic and antiproliferative characteristics in some tumor cells . However , the precise mechanisms of action are not entirely understood . AIM The main purpose of this study is to investigate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) in hesperidin's anticancer actions in human pre-B NALM-6 cells , which expresses wild-type p53 . METHODS The effects of hesperidin on cell-cycle distribution , proliferation , and caspase-mediated apoptosis were examined in NALM-6 cells in the presence or absence of GW9662 . The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARgamma ) , p53 , phospho-IkappaB , Bcl-2 , Bax , and XIAP proteins were focused on using the immunoblotting assay . The transcriptional activities of PPARgamma and nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) were analyzed by the transcription factor assay kits . The expression of PPARgamma and p53 was analyzed using the RT-PCR method . RESULTS Hesperidin induced the expression and transcriptional activity of PPARgamma and promoted p53 accumulation and downregulated constitutive NF-kappaB activity in a PPARgamma-dependent and PPARgamma-independent manner . The growth-inhibitory effect of hesperidin was partially reduced when the cells preincubated with PPARgamma antagonist prior to the exposure to hesperidin . CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study clearly demonstrate that hesperidin-mediated proapoptotic and antiproliferative actions are regulated via both PPARgamma-dependent and PPARgamma-independent pathways in NALM-6 cells . These data provide the first evidence that hesperidin could be developed as an agent against hematopoietic malignancies .
BACKGROUND Prostate cancer ( PCa ) progression is often associated with transactivation of the androgen receptor ( AR ) by endogenous hormones/growth factors . One such factor affecting growth , proliferation , and apoptostis ( pro-/anti- ) in various cancers is the adipokine leptin . This research studied leptin-induced signaling and apoptosis in androgen sensitive ( LNCaP , PC3/AR ) and insensitive ( PC3 , DU145 ) PCa cell lines . METHODS Signaling was studied by immunoblotting in cells overexpressing leptin receptors ( LRb ) , Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) , and kinase negative-HER2-YFP cDNAs . Apoptosis was measured by immunoblotting of apoptotic proteins and by Hoechst staining of condensed DNA . RESULTS Leptin rapidly induced activation of JAK2 , STAT3 , and MAPK ( ERK1/2 ) signaling cascades ; it may also induce HER2 transactivation via leptin-induced phospho-JAK2 . Leptin was then shown to exert clear pro-apoptotic effects , increasing levels of caspase 3 , cleavage of its substrate , poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) to cleaved PARP(89) , levels of CK 18 , a cytoskeletal protein formed during apoptosis , and DNA condensation . Kinase inhibitors indicated that leptin-induced apoptosis is probably mediated by balanced activation of JAK2/STAT3 , p38 MAPK , and PKC pathways in PCa cells . A human leptin mutein LRb antagonist , L39A/D40A/F41A , fully inhibited leptin-induced phosphorylation of JAK2 , ERK1/2 , and Akt/PKB , and partially abrogated effects on apoptotic proteins . In LNCaP and PC3/AR cells , leptin increased AR protein levels in correlation with raised apoptotic markers . Thus , AR may mediate , at least partly , the leptin-induced apoptotic response . CONCLUSIONS Leptin can clearly induce apoptosis in human PCa cell lines . These findings could lead to development of new leptin agonists with enhanced pro-apoptotic effects and targeted for use in human PCa .
BACKGROUND Androgens and the androgen receptor ( AR ) play important roles in the development of male urogenital organs . We previously found that mice with total AR knockout ( ARKO ) and epithelial ARKO failed to develop normal prostate with loss of differentiation . We have recently knocked out AR gene in smooth muscle cells and found the reduced luminal infolding and IGF-1 production in the mouse prostate . However , AR roles of stromal fibroblasts in prostate development remain unclear . METHODS To further probe the stromal fibroblast AR roles in prostate development , we generated tissue-selective knockout mice with the AR gene deleted in stromal fibroblasts ( FSP-ARKO ) . We also used primary culture stromal cells to confirm the in vivo data and investigate mechanisms related to prostate development . RESULTS The results showed cellular alterations in the FSP-ARKO mouse prostate with decreased epithelial proliferation , increased apoptosis , and decreased collagen composition . Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that FSP-ARKO mice have defects in the expression of prostate stromal growth factors . To further confirm these in vivo findings , we prepared primary cultured mouse prostate stromal cells and found knocking down the stromal AR could result in growth retardation of prostate stromal cells and co-cultured prostate epithelial cells , as well as decrease of some stromal growth factors . CONCLUSIONS Our FSP-ARKO mice not only provide the first in vivo evidence in Cre-loxP knockout system for the requirement of stromal fibroblast AR to maintain the normal development of the prostate , but may also suggest the selective knockdown of stromal AR might become a potential therapeutic approach to battle prostate hyperplasia and cancer .
Zinc dyshomeostasis can induce cell death . However , the mechanisms involved have not been fully elucidated in prostate cancer ( PCa ) cells , which differ dramatically from normal cells in their zinc handling ability . Here , we studied the effects of the ionophore Zn-pyrithione ( ZP ) and the chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine ( TPEN ) . Both compounds induced cell death at micromolar concentrations when incubated with androgen-dependent ( LNCaP ) , androgen-independent ( PC3 , DU145 ) and androgen-sensitive ( C4-2 ) PCa cell-lines . Compared to PCa cells , RWPE1 prostate epithelial cells were less sensitive to ZP and more sensitive to TPEN , but total cellular zinc levels were changed similarly . ZnSO4 enhanced the toxicity of ZP , but inhibited the effects of TPEN as expected . The morphological/biochemical responses to ZP and TPEN differed . ZP decreased ATP levels and stimulated ERK , AKT and PKC phosphorylation . DNA laddering was observed only at low doses of ZP but all doses of TPEN . TPEN activated caspase 3/7 and induced PARP-cleavage , DNA-fragmentation , ROS-formation and apoptotic bodies . PKC and ERK-pathway inhibitors , and antioxidants protected against ZP-induced but not TPEN-induced death . Inhibitors of MPTP-opening protected both . Cell death in response to TPEN ( but not ZP ) was diminished by a calpain inhibitor and largely prevented by a caspase 3 inhibitor . Overall , the results indicated primarily a necrotic cell death for ZP and an apoptotic cell death for TPEN . The enhanced sensitivity of PCa cells to ZP and the apparent ability of ZP and TPEN to kill quiescent and rapidly dividing cells in a p53-independent manner suggest that ZP/TPEN might be used to develop adjunct treatments for PCa .
Recent evidences suggest that the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 ( GSK3 ) contributes to the tumorigenic potential of pancreatic cancer cells through modulation of cell proliferation and survival . However , further investigations are needed to identify GSK3-dependent mechanisms involved in the control of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and survival . This study was undertaken to provide further support for a role of GSK3 in pancreatic cancer cell growth as well as to identify new cellular and molecular mechanisms involved . Herein , we demonstrate that prolonged inhibition of GSK3 triggers an apoptotic response only in human pancreatic cancer cells but not in human non-transformed pancreatic epithelial cells . We show that prolonged inhibition of GSK3 activity increases Bim messenger RNA and protein expressions . Moreover , we provide evidence that activation of the c-jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) pathway is necessary for the GSK3 inhibition-mediated increase in Bim expression and apoptotic response . Finally , we demonstrate that concomitant inhibition of GSK3 potentiates the death ligand-induced apoptotic response in pancreatic cancer cells but not in non-transformed pancreatic epithelial cells and that this effect also requires JNK activity . Considering that different approaches leading to stimulation of death receptor signaling are under clinical trials for treatment of unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer , inhibition of GSK3 could represent an attractive new avenue to improve their effectiveness .
OBJECTIVE : Emerging evidences implicate long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) are deregulated in cancer development . The purpose of the current study is to investigate the role of new lncRNA , named PlncRNA-1 , in prostate cancer ( CaP ) pathogenesis . MATERIALS AND METHODS : In this study , real-time q-PCR was used to demonstrate the expression of PlncRNA-1 in 16 pairs CaP tissues and matched normal tissues , 14 pairs CaP tissues and BPH tissues , 4 CaP cell lines , including LNCaP , LNCaP-AI , PC3 , and C4-2 , and 2 normal prostate epithelial cell lines RWPE-1 and PWR-1E . After PlncRNA-1 was suppressed by siRNA in LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cell lines , cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using CCK-8 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) . After PlncRNA-1 and AR was suppressed by siRNA in LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cell lines , real-time q-PCR and Western blotting were used to measure reciprocal regulation of PlncRNA-1 and AR . RESULTS : We showed that expression PlncRNA-1 , was significantly higher in CaP cells relative to normal prostate epithelial cells , as well as higher in human CaPs compared with normal tissues and benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) . Silencing of PlncRNA-1 significantly reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in CaP cell lines LNCaP and LNCaP-AI . Mechanistically , PlncRNA-1 suppression by siRNA resulted in a decrease of androgen receptor ( AR ) mRNA , protein and AR downstream target . Of note , blockade of AR signaling with siRNA also resulted in a suppression of PlncRNA-1 expression in CaP cell lines . CONCLUSIONS : Our study suggests reciprocal regulation of PlncRNA-1 and androgen receptor contribute to CaP pathogenesis and that PlncRNA-1 is a potential therapy target .
D-Limonene , a common monoterepene has been shown to have antiproliferative , apoptosis-inducing and chemopreventive effects . In the present study , we have investigated the effects of D-limonene on the growth of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene ( DMBA)-initiated and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-promoted skin tumor development . We found that D-limonene ( 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight ) treatments to the mouse skin significantly reduced the TPA-induced ( a ) edema and hyperplasia ( p < 0.001 ) ; ( b ) expression of cyclooxygenase-2 ; ( c ) ornithine decarboxylase activity ( p < 0.001 ) ; and ( d ) [ (3)H ] thymidine incorporation into DNA ( p < 0.001 ) . In addition , treatment of D-limonene effectively restored the level of reduced glutathione , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione reductase , glutathione S-transferase , catalase and malondialdehyde production in TPA-treated mouse skin . In a two-stage skin tumorigenesis study , D-limonene significantly reduced the tumor burden ( p < 0.005 ) and tumor incidence as compared to DMBA/TPA-treated mice . D-Limonene treatment also extended the latency period of tumor development from 4 to 9 weeks . D-Limonene treatment decreased the expression level of Ras , Raf and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 in DMBA/TPA-induced tumors . A decrease in the expression of Bcl-2 and an increase in Bax expression were also observed in tumor tissues of mice treated with D-limonene . Taken together , our findings suggest that D-limonene may exert its chemopreventive activity through the inhibition of inflammation , oxidative stress and Ras-signaling as well as the induction of pro-apoptotic state during TPA-mediated promotion of DMBA-induced skin cancer in mouse model .
BACKGROUND Death receptors ( DR ) of the TNF family function as anti-tumor immune effector molecules . Tumor cells , however , often exhibit DR-signaling resistance . Previous studies indicate that radiation can modify gene expression within tumor cells and increase tumor cell sensitivity to immune attack . The aim of this study is to investigate the synergistic effect of sub-lethal doses of ionizing radiation in sensitizing colorectal carcinoma cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The ability of radiation to modulate the expression of multiple death receptors ( Fas/CD95 , TRAILR1/DR4 , TRAILR2/DR5 , TNF-R1 and LTbetaR ) was examined in colorectal tumor cells . The functional significance of sub-lethal doses of radiation in enhancing tumor cell susceptibility to DR-induced apoptosis was determined by in vitro functional sensitivity assays . The longevity of these changes and the underlying molecular mechanism of irradiation in sensitizing diverse colorectal carcinoma cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis were also examined . We found that radiation increased surface expression of Fas , DR4 and DR5 but not LTbetaR or TNF-R1 in these cells . Increased expression of DRs was observed 2 days post-irradiation and remained elevated 7-days post irradiation . Sub-lethal tumor cell irradiation alone exhibited minimal cell death , but effectively sensitized three of three colorectal carcinoma cells to both TRAIL and Fas-induced apoptosis , but not LTbetaR-induced death . Furthermore , radiation-enhanced Fas and TRAIL-induced cell death lasted as long as 5-days post-irradiation . Specific analysis of intracellular sensitizers to apoptosis indicated that while radiation did reduce Bcl-X(L) and c-FLIP protein expression , this reduction did not correlate with the radiation-enhanced sensitivity to Fas and/or TRAIL mediated apoptosis among the three cell types . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Irradiation of tumor cells can overcome Fas and TRAIL resistance that is long lasting . Overall , results of these investigations suggest that non-lethal doses of radiation can be used to make human tumors more amenable to attack by anti-tumor effector molecules and cells .
BACKGROUND The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a validated therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . However , current single agent receptor targeting does not achieve a maximal therapeutic effect , and some mutations confer resistance to current available agents . In the current study we have examined , in different NSCLC cell lines , the combined effect of RNA interference targeting the EGFR mRNA , and inactivation of EGFR signaling using different receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) or a monoclonal antibody cetuximab . METHODS NSCLC cells ( cell lines HCC827 , H292 , H358 , H1650 , and H1975 ) were transfected with EGFR siRNA and/or treated with the TKIs gefitinib , erlotinib , and afatinib , and/or with the monoclonal antibody cetuximab . The reduction of EGFR mRNA expression was measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR . The down-regulation of EGFR protein expression was measured by western blot , and the proliferation , viability , caspase3/7 activity , and apoptotic morphology were monitored by spectrophotometry , fluorimetry , and fluorescence microscopy . The combined effect of EGFR siRNA and different drugs was evaluated using a combination index . RESULTS EGFR-specific siRNA strongly inhibited EGFR protein expression almost equally in all cell lines and inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis in all NSCLC cell lines studied , albeit with a different magnitude . The effects on growth obtained with siRNA was strikingly different from the effects obtained with TKIs . The effects of siRNA probably correlate with the overall oncogenic significance of the receptor , which is only partly inhibited by the TKIs . The cells which showed weak response to TKIs , such as the H1975 cell line containing the T790M resistance mutation , were found to be responsive to siRNA knockdown of EGFR , as were cell lines with downstream TKI resistance mutations . The cell line HCC827 , harboring an exon 19 deletion mutation , was more than 10-fold more sensitive to TKI proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction than any of the other cell lines . Cetuximab alone had no relevant in vitro activity at concentrations obtainable in the clinic . The addition of EGFR siRNA to either TKIs or cetuximab additively enhanced growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in all five cell lines , independent of the EGFR mutation status ( wild-type or sensitizing mutation or resistant mutation ) . The strongest biological effect was observed when afatinib was combined with an EGFR-specific siRNA . CONCLUSIONS EGFR knockdown by siRNA further decreases the cell growth of lung cancer cells that are treated with TKIs or cetuximab alone , confirming that single agent drug targeting does not achieve a maximal biological effect . The siRNA inhibits EGFR oncogenic activity that bypasses downstream " resistance " mutations such as KRAS and PTEN . The combined treatment of siRNA and EGFR inhibitory agents is additive . The combination of a potent , irreversible kinase inhibitor such as afatinib , with EGFR-specific siRNAs should be further investigated as a new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer and other EGFR dependent cancers , including those with downstream resistance mutations .
CDKN1C/P57 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor implicated in different human cancers , including hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) ; however , little is known regarding the role of CDKN1C/P57 and its regulation in HCC . In this study , we show that the down-regulation of Notch1 and Notch3 in two HCC cell lines resulted in Hes1 down-regulation , CDKN1C/P57 up-regulation , and reduced cell growth . In line with these data , we report that CDKN1C/P57 is a target of transcriptional repression by the Notch effector , Hes1 . We found that the up-regulation of CDKN1C/P57 by cDNA transfection decreased tumor growth , as determined by growth curve , flow cytometry analysis , and cyclin D1 down-regulation , without affecting the apoptosis machinery . Indeed , the expression of Bax , Noxa , PUMA , BNIP(3) , and cleaved caspase-3 was not affected by CDKN1C/P57 induction . Morphologically CDKN1C/p57-induced HCC cells became flat and lengthened in shape , accumulated the senescence-associated beta-galactosidase marker , and increased P16 protein expression . Evaluation of senescence in cells depleted both for Hes1 and CDKN1C/P57 revealed that the senescent state really depends on the accumulation of CDKN1C/p57 . Finally , we validated our in vitro results in primary HCCs , showing that Hes1 protein expression inversely correlates with CDKN1C/P57 mRNA levels . In addition , reduced Hes1 protein expression is accompanied by a shorter time to recurrence after curative resection , suggesting that Hes1 may represent a biomarker for prediction of patients with poor prognosis .
Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide . Major risk factors of HCC include infection with hepatitis B or C viruses , alcohol and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . HCC is difficult to diagnose at early stage , and has a very poor survival rate when diagnosed at a late stage . The majority of HCC-related deaths result from local invasion ( to cause liver failure ) or distant metastases . There is an urgent need to identify effective molecular targets for the treatment of the disease . As the target of an established class of therapeutic agent thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) has been widely studied for its role in the development of HCC . A substantial body of evidence based on in vitro and in vivo models indicates that the activation of PPARgamma is able to inhibit HCC cell proliferation and tumor growth through inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the regulation of a panel of downstream effector molecules . PPARgamma activation also induces an inhibitory effect on HCC metastasis . Meanwhile , there is new evidence suggesting that PPARgamma inhibition could also be anti-tumorigenic . In the present review , we summarize the available information on the role of PPARgamma in HCC development and spread , and discuss whether PPARgamma activation by TZDs could play a role in the treatment of HCC , summarizing both in vitro and in vivo . Considering the available data , PPARgamma seems to exert beneficial effects against HCC and may therefore represent as a therapeutic target .
Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , accounting for 80% of lung cancers , is the leading cause of all cancer deaths . Previously , we demonstrated that delta-tocotrienol inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation , invasion and induces apoptosis by down-regulation of the Notch-1 signaling pathway . The objective of this study was to investigate whether delta-tocotrienol , could enhance the anticancer effects of cisplatin . Treatment with a combination of delta-tocotrienol and cisplatin resulted in a dose-dependent , significant inhibition of cell growth , migration , invasiveness , and induction of apoptosis in NSCLC cells , as compared to the single agents . This was associated with a decrease in NF-kappaB DNA binding activity , decrease in Notch-1 , Hes-1 , Bcl-2 and increase in cleaved Caspase-3 and PARP expressions . These results suggest that down-regulation of Notch-1 , via inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling pathways by delta-tocotrienol and cisplatin , in combination , could provide a potential novel approach for tumor arrest in NSCLC , while lowering the effective dose of cisplatin .
Bone marrow necrosis ( BMN ) is a rare finding in children with malignancy occurring most commonly in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia . This article describes the first case of a girl who developed BMN during treatment for Hodgkin's disease . During the second cycle of chemotherapy , she experienced sudden profound bone pain in the lumbosacral region associated with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , fibrin degradation products ( D-Dimer ) , and alkaline phosphatase as well as pancytopenia and leukoerythroblastosis . MRI studies showed multiple confluent areas with low signal intensity and rim contrast enhancement in all vertebral bodies . Bone marrow biopsy revealed focal necrosis within hypocellular bone marrow . The patient responded quickly to symptomatic treatment with analgetics and heparin ; however , elevations of LDH and D-Dimer persisted for 1.5 and 8 months , respectively . Clinicians should be aware of this rare condition to establish the diagnosis and to continue oncologic treatment as early as possible .
Fagonia indica is a small spiny shrub of great ethnopharmacological importance in folk medicine . The aqueous decoction of aerial parts is a popular remedy against various skin lesions , including cancer . We used a biological activity-guided fractionation approach to isolate the most potent fraction of the crude extract on three cancer cell lines : MCF-7 oestrogen-dependent breast cancer , MDA-MB-468 oestrogen-independent breast cancer , and Caco-2 colon cancer cells . A series of chromatographic and spectroscopic procedures were utilised on the EtOAc fraction , which resulted in the isolation of a new steroidal saponin glycoside . The cytotoxic activity of the saponin glycoside was determined in cancer cells using the MTT and neutral red uptake assays . After 24h treatment , the observed IC(50) values of the saponin glycoside were 12.5 muM on MDA-MB-468 and Caco-2 cells , but 100 muM on MCF-7 cells . Several lines of evidence : PARP cleavage , caspase-3 cleavage , DNA ladder assays , and reversal of growth inhibition with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk , suggested stimulation of apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and Caco-2 cells , but not in MCF-7 cells , which do not express caspase-3 . The haemolytic activity of the saponin glycoside was confirmed in sheep red blood cells , with cell lysis observed at >100 muM , suggesting that , at this concentration , the saponin glycoside caused necrosis through cell lysis in MCF-7 cells . Using the DNA ladder assay , the saponin glycoside ( 12.5 muM ) was not toxic to HUVEC ( human umbilical vein endothelial cells ) or U937 cells , indicating some selectivity between malignant and normal cells . We conclude that the steroidal saponin glycoside isolated from F. indica is able to induce apoptosis or necrosis in cancer cells depending on the cell type .
The role of energy deregulation and altered/adapted metabolism in tumor cells is an increasingly important issue in understanding cancer . Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma ( HLRCC ) is an aggressive form of RCC characterized by germline mutation of fumarate hydratase ( FH ) , followed by somatic loss of the remaining wild-type allele and known to be a highly metastatic and lethal malignancy compared to other RCCs . The intrinsic loss of normal tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle presumably aids tumorigenesis due to the necessary metabolic alterations required and the enforced dependence on glycolysis derived energy , mimicking the Warburg effect . Thus , there is considerable utility in establishing a preclinical cell model from these tumors to study energy metabolism deregulation , as well as developing new targeted therapeutic approaches for TCA cycle enzyme-deficient cancers . Here , we describe a new immortalized cell line , UOK268 , derived from a patient's primary HLRCC-associated kidney cancer . This represents the first primary renal cell line to model TCA cycle gene loss and provides a perfect partner cell line to our previously described metastasis-derived HLRCC-associated cell line , UOK262 . We identified a novel germline FH missense mutation , p.His192Asp , and the subsequent loss of heterozygosity in UOK268 . The UOK268 cell line expressed mutant FH protein , which localized to the mitochondria , but with loss of almost all catalytic activity . The UOK268 cells had severely compromised oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolytic flux . Ingenuity pathways analysis of human mitochondria-focused cDNA microarray ( hMitChip3 ) gene chip data confirmed the altered mRNA expression patterns of genes involved in several important pathways , such as lipid metabolism , apoptosis , and energy production/glycolysis . UOK268 provides a unique model of a primary cell line demonstrating an enforced , irreversible Warburg effect and , combined with UOK262 , provides a unique invitro preclinical model for studying the bioenergetics of the Warburg effect in human cancer .
OBJECTIVES To investigate the expression of TLR-4 ( toll-like receptor ) on human cervical cancer and find the biological function of the TLR-4 signal system . METHODS The immunohistochemistry method was performed to study the protein expression and distribution of TLR-4 . The viability of HeLa cells was determined by cell viability assay . Cell proliferation was detected by FCM , ELISA and Western blot were used to observe the gene and protein expression of IL-6 and TGF-beta1 in Hela cell lines . RESULTS TLR-4 was over-expressed in cervix cancer , and its activation by LPS promotes proliferation and anti-apoptosis in Hela cells in vitro . Moreover the cell line proliferation increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner . The production of IL-6 and TGF-beta1 were promoted through the activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway .
IFN-gamma is a master regulator of the immune responses that occur in the transplanted kidney , acting both on the immune system and on the graft itself . The cellular responses to IFN-gamma are complex , and emerging evidence suggests that IFN-gamma may regulate autophagic functions . Conversely , autophagy modulates innate and adaptive immune functions in various contexts . In this study , we identify a novel mechanism by which IFN-gamma activates autophagy in human kidney epithelial cells and provide new insights into how autophagy regulates immune functions in response to IFN-gamma . Our results indicate that IFN-gamma promotes tryptophan depletion , activates the eIF2alpha kinase general control nonderepressible-2 ( GCN2 ) , and leads to an increase in the autophagic flux . Further , tryptophan supplementation and RNA interference directed against GCN2 inhibited IFN-gamma-induced autophagy . This process is of functional relevance because autophagy regulates the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors by human kidney epithelial cells in response to IFN-gamma . These findings assign to IFN-gamma a novel function in the regulation of autophagy , which , in turn , modulates IFN-gamma-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines .
When the prostate cancer cells become unresponsive to androgen therapy , resistance to chemotherapy becomes imminent , resulting in high mortality . To combat this situation , lycopodine , a pharmacologically important bioactive component derived from Lycopodium clavatum spores , was tested against hormone sensitive ( LnCaP ) and refractory ( PC3 ) prostate cancer cells in vitro . This study aims to check if lycopodine has demonstrable anti-cancer effects and if it has , to find out the possible mechanism of its action . The MTT assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect . Depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential , cell cycle , EGF receptor activity and apoptosis were recorded by FACS ; profiles of different anti- and pro-apoptotic genes and their products were studied by semi-quantitative RT-PCR , indirect-ELISA , western blotting . Drug-DNA interaction was determined by CD spectroscopy . Administration of lycopodine down-regulated the expression of 5-lipoxygenase and the 5-oxo-ETE receptor ( OXE receptor1 ) and EGF receptor , and caused up-regulation of cytochrome c with depolarization of mitochondrial inner membrane potential , without palpable change in p53 activity , resulting in apoptosis , cell arrest at G0/G1 stage and ultimately reduced proliferation of cancer cells ; concomitantly , there was externalization of phosphotidyl serine residues . CD spectroscopic analysis revealed intercalating property of lycopodine with DNA molecule , implicating its ability to block cellular DNA synthesis . The overall results suggest that lycopodine is a promising candidate suitable for therapeutic use as an anti-cancer drug .
Invasion and metastasis are the major causes of cancer-related death . Pharmacological or therapeutic interventions such as chemoprevention of the progression stages of neoplastic development could result in substantial reduction in the incidence of cancer mortality . ( -)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG ) , a promising chemopreventive agent , has attracted extensive interest for cancer therapy utilizing its antioxidant , anti- proliferative and inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion . In this study , we assessed the influence of EGCG on the proliferative potential of HeLa cells by cell viability assay and authenticated the results by nuclear morphological examination , DNA laddering assay and cell cycle analysis . Further we analyzed the anti-invasive properties of EGCG by wound migration assay and gene expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in HeLa cells . Our results indicated that EGCG induced growth inhibition of HeLa cells in a dose- and time- dependent manner . It was observed that cell death mediated by EGCG was through apoptosis . Interestingly , EGCG effectively inhibited invasion and migration of HeLa cells and modulated the expression of related genes ( MMP-9 and TIMP-1 ) . These results indicate that EGCG may effectively suppress promotion and progression stages of cervical cancer development .
Many molecular mechanisms contribute to the development of doxorubicin resistance and different cancers can express wide and diverse arrays of drug-resistance genes . The aim of this study was to identify the changes in gene expression associated with the development of doxorubicin resistance in MCF7 breast cancer cell line . The doxorubicin resistant MCF7 cell line was developed by stepwise selection of MCF7 cells and was tested using the MTT assay . The alterations in gene expression were examined using the real-time based PCR array . The findings showed an up-regulation of many phase I/II metabolizing genes , specifically , the CYP1A1 and the CYP1A2 that were up-regulated by 206- and 96-fold respectively . Drug efflux pump genes were also up-regulated profoundly . TOP2A was strongly down-regulated by 202-fold . Many other changes were observed in genes crucial for cell cycle , apoptosis and DNA repair . The findings of this project imply that the development of doxorubicin resistance is a multi-factorial process .
TP53 mutations compromising p53 transcriptional function occur in more than 50% of human cancers , including pancreatic adenocarcinoma , and render cancer cells more resistant to conventional therapy . In the last few years , many efforts have been addressed to identify p53-reactivating molecules able to restore the wild-type transcriptionally competent conformation of the mutated proteins . Here , we show that two of these compounds , CP-31398 and RITA , induce cell growth inhibition , apoptosis , and autophagy by activating p53/DNA binding and p53 phosphorylation ( Ser15 ) , without affecting the total p53 amount . These effects occur in both wild-type and mutant p53 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines , whereas they are much less pronounced in normal human primary fibroblasts . Furthermore , CP-31398 and RITA regulate the axis SESN1-2/AMPK/mTOR by inducing AMPK phosphorylation on Thr172 , which has a crucial role in the autophagic response . The protective role of autophagy in cell growth inhibition by CP-31398 and RITA is supported by the finding that the AMPK inhibitor compound C or the autophagy inhibitors chloroquine or 3-methyladenine sensitize both pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines to the apoptotic response induced by p53-reactivating molecules . Our results demonstrate for the first time a survival role for autophagy induced by p53-reactivating molecules , supporting the development of an anti-cancer therapy based on autophagy inhibition associated to p53 activation .
Androgens regulate both the physiological development of the prostate and the pathology of prostatic diseases . However , the mechanisms by which androgens exert their regulatory activities on these processes are poorly understood . In this study , we have determined that androgens regulate overall cell metabolism and cell growth , in part , by increasing autophagy in prostate cancer cells . Importantly , inhibition of autophagy using either pharmacological or molecular inhibitors significantly abrogated androgen-induced prostate cancer cell growth . Mechanistically , androgen-mediated autophagy appears to promote cell growth by augmenting intracellular lipid accumulation , an effect previously demonstrated to be necessary for prostate cancer cell growth . Further , autophagy and subsequent cell growth is potentiated , in part , by androgen-mediated increases in reactive oxygen species . These findings demonstrate a role for increased fat metabolism and autophagy in prostatic neoplasias and highlight the potential of targeting underexplored metabolic pathways for the development of novel therapeutics .
Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a clonal disease of plasma cells that remains incurable despite the advent of several novel therapeutics . In this study , we aimed to delineate the impact of snake venom extracted from Walterinnesia aegyptia ( WEV ) alone or in combination with silica nanoparticles ( WEV+NP ) on primary MM cells isolated from patients diagnosed with MM as well as on two MM cell lines , U266 and RPMI 8226 . The IC(50) values of WEV and WEV+NP that significantly decreased MM cell viability without affecting the viability of normal peripheral mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were determined to be 25 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml , respectively . Although both WEV ( 25 ng/ml ) and WEV+NP ( 10 ng/ml ) decreased the CD54 surface expression without affecting the expression of CXCR4 ( CXCL12 receptor ) on MM cells , they significantly reduced the ability of CXC chemokine ligand 12 ( CXCL12 ) to induce actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and the subsequent reduction in chemotaxis . It has been established that the binding of CXCL12 to its receptor CXCR4 activates multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate MM cell chemotaxis , adhesion , and proliferation . We found that WEV and WEV+NP clearly decreased the CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated activation of AKT , ERK , NFkappaB and Rho-A using western blot analysis ; abrogated the CXCL12-mediated proliferation of MM cells using the CFSE assay ; and induced apoptosis in MM cell as determined by PI/annexin V double staining followed by flow cytometry analysis . Monitoring the expression of B-cell CCL/Lymphoma 2 ( Bcl-2 ) family members and their role in apoptosis induction after treatment with WEV or WEV+NP revealed that the combination of WEV with NP robustly decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic effectors Bcl-2 , Bcl(XL) and Mcl-1 ; conversely increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic effectors Bak , Bax and Bim ; and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential in MM cells . Taken together , our data reveal the biological effects of WEV and WEV+NP and the underlying mechanisms against myeloma cancer cells .
BACKGROUND: : Radiotherapy is an efficient remedy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma ( Hca ) ; however , some cancer cells can still survive from the radiation and the therapeutic effect is to be improved . Regulatory T cell ( Tregs)-induced tumor tolerance and Akt expression play important roles in the tumor survival . This study aims to elucidate the role of radiation induces Akt expression in Tregs . METHODS: : A rat Hca model was developed . Hca tissue was collected from the rats with or without radiotherapy . The frequency of Treg and apoptotic Treg in Hca tissue was assessed by flow cytometry . A cell culture model was used to investigate the mechanism by which the tumor-infiltrating Tregs survive from irradiation . RESULTS: : After radiotherapy , the frequency of Treg was increased in Hca , the frequency of apoptotic Tregs was decreased and the expression of Akt was increased in the remaining Tregs . The results were reproduced in vitro with a cell culture model . The addition of Akt inhibitor blocked the irradiation-induced Treg survival . Tregs with high levels of Akt still preserve the immune suppressor function . CONCLUSIONS: : Akt plays an important role in the radiation-induced tumor-infiltrating Treg survival in Hca .
PURPOSE : Prostate cancer ( PCa ) development is often associated with deletion or silencing of tumor suppressor PTEN , a negative regulator of the PI3K-Akt pathway , leading to resistance to various therapies . Therefore , the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a central role in various cellular processes leading to malignant phenotype , and , consequently is an attractive target . However , the efficacy of AKT inhibitors is limited by resistance mechanisms that result in minimal tumor cell death . Methods:Effects of Akt inhibitor AZD5363 were investigated on cell proliferation , apoptosis , Akt pathway and survival mechanisms . We then examined the impacts of inhibition of autophagy combined with AZD5363 on cell proliferation and apoptosis . Furthermore , the anti-cancer activity of combination treatment of the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy ( chloroquine ) with Akt inhibitor AZD5363 was evaluated in PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts . RESULTS : we show that AZD5363 affected Akt downstream pathway by reducing p-mTOR , p-P70S6K and p-S6K . While AZD5363 monotherapy induced G2 growth arrest and autophagy , it failed to induce significant apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 PCa cells . Blocking autophagy using pharmacological inhibitors or genetic inhibitors enhanced cell death induced by AZD5363 in these PCa cells . Importantly , the combination of AZD5363 with chloroquine significantly reduced tumor volume by 84.9% compared with the control group and by 77.5% compared with either drug alone in PC3 xenografts . CONCLUSIONS : These data demonstrate that Akt inhibitor AZD5363 , synergizes with the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy , chloroquine , to induce apoptosis and delay tumor progression in PCa models that are resistant to monotherapy AZD5363 , providing a new therapeutic approach potentially translatable to patients .
Our study was to elucidate the mechanisms whereby BMS-345541 ( BMS , a specific I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 inhibitor ) inhibits the repair of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) and evaluate whether BMS can sensitize MCF-7 breast cancer cells ( MCF-7 cells ) to ionizing radiation ( IR ) in an apoptosis-independent manner . In this study , MCF-7 cells were exposed to IR in vitro and in vivo with or without pretreatment of BMS . The effects of BMS on the repair of IR-induced DSBs by homologous recombination ( HR ) and non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) were analyzed by the DR-GFP and EJ5-GFP reporter assays and IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX , 53BP1 , Brca1 and Rad51 foci assays . The mechanisms by which BMS inhibits HR were examined by microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription PCR . The effects of BMS on the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to IR were determined by MTT and clonogenic assays in vitro and tumor growth inhibition in vivo in a xenograft mouse model . The results showed that BMS selectively inhibited HR repair of DSBs in MCF-7 cells , most likely by down-regulation of several genes that participate in HR . This resulted in a significant increase in the DNA damage response that sensitizes MCF-7 cells to IR-induced cell death in an apoptosis-independent manner . Furthermore , BMS treatment sensitized MCF-7 xenograft tumors to radiation therapy in vivo in an association with a significant delay in the repair of IR-induced DSBs . These data suggest that BMS is a novel HR inhibitor that has the potential to be used as a radiosensitizer to increase the responsiveness of cancer to radiotherapy .
gamma-Tocotrienol and sesamin are phytochemicals that display potent anticancer activity . Since sesamin inhibits the metabolic degradation of tocotrienols , studies were conducted to determine if combined treatment with sesamin potentiates the antiproliferative effects of gamma-tocotrienol on neoplastic mouse ( +SA ) and human ( MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 ) mammary cancer cells . Results showed that treatment with gamma-tocotrienol or sesamin alone induced a significant dose-responsive growth inhibition , whereas combination treatment with these agents synergistically inhibited the growth of +SA , MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 mammary cancer cells , while similar treatment doses were found to have little or no effect on normal ( mouse CL-S1 and human MCF-10A ) mammary epithelial cell growth or viability . However , sesamin synergistic enhancement of gamma-tocotrienol-induced anticancer effects was not found to be mediated from a reduction in gamma-tocotrienol metabolism . Rather , combined treatment with subeffective doses of gamma-tocotrienol and sesamin was found to induce G1 cell cycle arrest , and a corresponding decrease in cyclin D1 , CDK2 , CDK4 , CDK6 , phospho-Rb , and E2F1 levels , and increase in p27 and p16 levels . Additional studies showed that the antiproliferative effect of combination treatment did not initiate apoptosis or result in a decrease in mammary cancer cell viability . Taken together , these findings indicate that the synergistic antiproliferative action of combined gamma-tocotrienol and sesamin treatment in mouse and human mammary cancer cells is cytostatic , not cytotoxic , and results from G1 cell cycle arrest .
ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : Survivin , a member of the family of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins , functions as a key regulator of mitosis and programmed cell death . YM155 , a novel molecular targeted agent , suppresses survivin , which is overexpressed in many tumor types . The aim of this study was to determine the antitumor activity of YM155 in SK-NEP-1 cells . METHODS : SK-NEP-1 cell growth in vitro and in vivo was assessed by MTT and nude mice experiments . Annexin V/propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometric analysis was used to detect apoptosis in cell culture . Then gene expression profile of tumor cells treated with YM155 was analyzed with real-time PCR arrays . We then analyzed the expression data with MEV ( Multi Experiment View ) cluster software . Datasets representing genes with altered expression profile derived from cluster analyses were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool . RESULTS : YM155 treatment resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation of SK-NEP-1cells in a dose-dependent manner . Annexin V assay , cell cycle , and activation of caspase-3 demonstrates that YM155 induced apoptosis in SK-NEP-1 cells . YM155 significantly inhibited growth of SK-NEP-1 xenografts ( YM155 5 mg/kg : 1.45 +/- 0.77 cm3 ; YM155 10 mg/kg : 0.95 +/- 0.55 cm3 ) compared to DMSO group ( DMSO : 3.70 +/- 2.4 cm3 ) or PBS group cells ( PBS : 3.78 +/- 2.20 cm3 , ANOVA P < 0.01 ) . YM155 treatment decreased weight of tumors ( YM155 5 mg/kg : 1.05 +/- 0.24 g ; YM155 10 mg/kg : 0.72 +/- 0.17 g ) compared to DMSO group ( DMSO : 2.06 +/- 0.38 g ) or PBS group cells ( PBS : 2.36 +/- 0.43 g , ANOVA P < 0.01 ) . Real-time PCR array analysis showed between Test group and control group there are 32 genes significantly up-regulated and 54 genes were significantly down-regulated after YM155 treatment . Ingenuity pathway analysis ( IPA ) showed cell death was the highest rated network with 65 focus molecules and the significance score of 44 . The IPA analysis also groups the differentially expressed genes into biological mechanisms that are related to cell death , cellular function maintenance , cell morphology , carbohydrate metabolism and cellular growth and proliferation . Death receptor signaling ( 3.87E-19 ) , TNFR1 signaling , induction of apoptosis by HIV1 , apoptosis signaling and molecular mechanisms of cancer came out to be the top four most significant pathways . IPA analysis also showed top molecules up-regulated were BBC3 , BIRC3 , BIRC8 , BNIP1 , CASP7 , CASP9 , CD5 , CDKN1A , CEBPG and COL4A3 , top molecules down-regulated were ZNF443 , UTP11L , TP73 , TNFSF10 , TNFRSF1B , TNFRSF25 , TIAF1 , STK17A , SST and SPP1 , upstream regulator were NR3C1 , TP53 , dexamethasone , TNF and Akt . CONCLUSIONS : The present study demonstrates that YM155 treatment resulted in apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation of SK-NEP-1cells . YM155 had significant role and little side effect in the treatment of SK-NEP-1 xenograft tumors . Real-time PCR array analysis firstly showed expression profile of genes dyes-regulated after YM155 treatment . IPA analysis also represents new molecule mechanism of YM155 treatment , such as NR3C1 and dexamethasone may be new target of YM155 . And our results may provide new clues of molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by YM155 .
Sunitinib is an oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity that mainly targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptors , and recently , it has been shown to be an active agent for the treatment of malignant pheochromocytomas . Previously , we demonstrated that sunitinib directly inhibited mTORC1 signaling in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells . Although autophagy is a highly regulated cellular process , its relevance to cancer seems to be complicated . It is of note that inhibition of mTORC1 is a prerequisite for autophagy induction . Indeed , direct mTORC1 inhibition initiates ULK1/2 autophosphorylation and subsequent Atg13 and FIP200 phosphorylation , inducing autophagy . Here , we demonstrated that sunitinib significantly increased the levels of LC3-II , concomitant with a decrease of p62 in PC12 cells . Following sunitinib treatment , immunofluorescent imaging revealed a marked increased punctate LC3-II distribution . Furthermore , Atg13 knockdown significantly reduced its protein level , which in turn abolished sunitinib-induced autophagy . Moreover , inhibition of autophagy by siRNAs targeting Atg13 or by pharmacological inhibition with ammonium chloride , enhanced both sunitinib-induced apoptosis and anti-proliferation . Thus , sunitinib-induced autophagy is dependent on the suppression of mTORC1 signaling and the formation of ULK1/2-Atg13-FIP200 complexes . Inhibition of autophagy may be a promising therapeutic option for improving the anti-tumor effect of sunitinib .
N-Ras is one member of a family of oncoproteins that are commonly mutated in cancer . Activating mutations in N-Ras occur in a subset of colorectal cancers , but little in known about how the mutant protein contributes to onset and progression of the disease . Using genetically engineered mice , we find that mutant N-Ras strongly promotes tumorigenesis in the context of inflammation . The pro-tumorigenic nature of mutant N-Ras is related to its anti-apoptotic function , which is mediated by activation of a non-canonical MAPK pathway that signals through Stat3 . As a result , inhibition of MEK selectively induces apoptosis in autochthonous colonic tumors expressing mutant N-Ras . The translational significance of this finding is highlighted by our observation that NRAS mutation correlates with a less favorable clinical outcome for colorectal cancer patients . These data demonstrate for the first time the important role that N-Ras plays in colorectal cancer .
The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway regulates the viability and radiosensitivity of head and neck squamous cancer cells ( HNSCC ) . Increased beta-catenin predisposes HNSCC patients to poor prognosis and survival . This study was conducted to determine the mechanism by which beta-catenin regulates the viability of HNSCC . AMC-HN-3 , -HN-8 , UM-SCC-38 , and -SCC-47 cells , which were established from human head and neck cancer specimens , underwent cell death following beta-catenin silencing. beta-Catenin silencing significantly induced G1 arrest and increased the expression of Bax and active caspase-3 , which demonstrates the sequential activation of apoptotic cascades following treatment of HNSCC with targeted siRNA . Intriguingly , beta-catenin silencing also induced autophagy . Here , we confirm that the number of autophagic vacuoles and the expression of type II light chain 3 were increased in cells that were treated with beta-catenin siRNA . These cell death modes are most likely due to the activation of LKB1-dependent AMPK following beta-catenin silencing . The activated LKB1/AMPK pathway in AMC-HN-3 cells caused G1 arrest by phosphorylating p53 and suppressing mTOR signaling . In addition , treating AMC-HN-3 cells with LKB1 siRNA preserved cell viability against beta-catenin silencing-induced cytotoxicity . Taken together , these results imply that following beta-catenin silencing , HNSCC undergo both apoptotic and autophagic cell death that are under the control of LKB1/AMPK . To the best of our knowledge , these results suggest for the first time that novel crosstalk between beta-catenin and the LKB1/AMPK pathway regulates the viability of HNSCC . This study thus presents new insights into our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in beta-catenin silencing-induced cell death .
Aurora kinases play an essential role in mitotic progression and are potentially druggable targets in cancer therapy . We identified benzo[e]pyridoindoles ( BePI ) as powerful aurora kinase inhibitors . Their efficiency was demonstrated both in enzymatic inhibition studies and in cell culture assays . New BePI molecules were synthesized , and a structure-activity relationship study was conducted with the aim of improving the activity and solubility of the lead compound . Tetracyclic BePI derivatives are characterized by a particular curved shape , and the presence of an oxo group on the pyridine ring was found to be required for aurora kinase B inhibition . New hydrosoluble benzo[e]pyridoindolones were subsequently designed , and their efficacy was tested by a combination of cell-cycle analysis and time-lapse experiments in live cells . The most active BePI derivative , 13 b , inhibited the cell cycle , drove cells to polyploidy , and eventually induced apoptosis . It exhibited high antiproliferative activity in HeLa cells with an IC(50) value of 63 nM . Relative to compounds tested in clinical trials , this antiproliferative potency places 13 b among the top 10 aurora kinase inhibitors . Our results justify further in vivo evaluation in preclinical animal models of cancer .
Hormone antagonist therapy for estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) breast cancer patients post radical surgery and radiation therapy has a poor prognosis and also causes bone loss. 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [ 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) ] is a potent antitumor agent in pre-clinical studies , but caused hypercalcemia when its effective antitumor doses were used . Therefore , we investigated the effects of a less-calcemic 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) analog , 19-nor-2alpha-(3-hydroxypropyl)-1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3 )(MART-10 ) , on ER+MCF-7 cells . We demonstrate that MART-10 is 500- to 1000-fold more potent than 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in inhibiting cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner . MART-10 is also much more potent in arresting MCF-7cell cycle progression at G(0)/G(1) phase as compared to 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) , possibly mediated by a greater induction of p21 and p27 expression . Moreover , MART-10 is more active than 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in causing cell apoptosis , likely through a higher BAX/Bcl expression ratio and the subsequent cytochrome C release from mitochondria to cytosol . Based on our in vitro findings , MART-10 could be a promising vitamin D analog for the potential treatment of breast cancer , for example , ER+ patients , to decrease the tumor relapse rate and the side effect on bone caused by antihormone regimens . Thus , further in vivo animal study is warranted .
Retinoic acid ( RA ) has been believed to be an anticancer drug for a long history . However , the molecular mechanisms of RA actions on cancer cells remain diverse . In this study , the dose-dependent inhibition of RA on DU145 cell proliferation was identified . Interestingly , RA treatment triggered p35 cleavage ( p25 formation ) and Cdk5 overactivation , and all could be blocked by Calpain inhibitor , Calpeptin ( CP ) . Subsequently , RA-triggered DU145 apoptosis detected by sub-G1 phase accumulation and Annexin V staining could also be blocked by CP treatment . Furthermore , RA-triggered caspase 3 activation and following Cdk5 over-activation were destroyed by treatments of both CP and Cdk5 knockdown . In conclusion , we report a new mechanism in which RA could cause apoptosis of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells through p35 cleavage and Cdk5 over-activation . This finding may contribute to constructing a clearer image of RA function and bring RA as a valuable chemoprevention agent for prostate cancer patients .
Background . Multiple myeloma ( MM ) , an almost incurable disease , is the second most common blood cancer . Initial chemotherapeutic treatment could be successful ; however , resistance development urges the use of higher toxic doses accompanied by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . The establishment of more effective treatments that can overcome or circumvent chemoresistance has become a priority . We recently demonstrated that venom extracted from Walterinnesia aegyptia ( WEV ) either alone or in combination with silica nanoparticles ( WEV+NPs ) mediated the growth arrest and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells . In the present study , we evaluated the impact of WEV alone and WEV+NP on proliferation and apoptosis of MM cells . Methods . The impacts of WEV alone and WEV+NP were monitored in MM cells from 70 diagnosed patients . The influences of WEV and WEV+NP were assessed with flow cytometry analysis . Results . WEV alone and WEV+NP decreased the viability of MM cells . Using a CFSE proliferation assay , we found that WEV+NP strongly inhibited MM cell proliferation . Furthermore , analysis of the cell cycle using the propidium iodide ( PI ) staining method indicated that WEV+NP strongly altered the cell cycle of MM cells and enhanced the induction of apoptosis . Conclusions . Our data reveal the biological effects of WEV and WEV+NP on MM cells that enable these compounds to function as effective treatments for MM .
Luteolin is a plant flavonoid which exhibits anti-oxidative , anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects . However , the antiproliferative potential of luteolin is not fully understood . In this study , we investigated the effect of luteolin on cell cycling and apoptosis in human esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line Eca109 cells . MTT assays showed that luteolin had obvious cytotoxicity on Eca109 with an IC50 of 70.7<FFFD>1.72 muM at 24 h . Luteolin arrested cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase and prevented entry into S phase in a dose- and time-dependent manner. as assessed by FCM . Luteolin induced apoptosis of Eca109 cells was demonstrated by AO/EB staining assay and annexin V-FITC/PI staining . Moreover , luteolin downregulated the expression of cyclin D1 , survivin and c-myc , and it also upregulated the expression of p53 , in line with the fact that luteolin was able to inhibit Eca109 cell proliferation .
Onions ( Allium cepa L. ) are widely used in the food industry for its nutritional and aromatic properties . Our studies showed that ethyl acetate extract of onion ( EEO ) had potent inhibitory effects on animal fatty acid synthase ( FAS ) , and could induce apoptosis in FAS over-expressing human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells . Furthermore , this apoptosis was accompanied by reduction of intracellular FAS activity and could be rescued by 25 mM or 50 mM exogenous palmitic acids , the final product of FAS catalyzed synthesis . These results suggest that the apoptosis induced by EEO occurs via inhibition of FAS . We also found that EEO could suppress lipid accumulation during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes , which was also related to its inhibition of intracellular FAS activity . Since obesity is closely related to breast cancer and obese patients are at elevated risk of developing various cancers , these findings suggested that onion might be useful for preventing obesity-related malignancy .
The new concept of keeping primary tumor under control in situ to suppress distant foci sheds light on the novel treatment of metastatic tumor . Hyperthermia is considered as one of the means for controlling tumor growth . In this study , a novel thermal modality was built to introduce hyperthermia effect on tumor to suppress its growth and progression using 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma , a common animal model of metastatic breast cancer . A mildly raised temperature ( i.e.39<FFFD>C ) was imposed on the skin surface of the implanted tumor using a thermal heating pad . Periodic heating ( 12 hours per day ) was carried out for 3 days , 7 days , 14 days , and 21 days , respectively . The tumor growth rate was found significantly decreased in comparison to the control without hyperthermia . Biological evidences associated with tumor angiogenesis and metastasis were examined using histological analyses . Accordingly , the effect of mild hyperthermia on immune cell infiltration into tumors was also investigated . It was demonstrated that a delayed tumor growth and malignancy progression was achieved by mediating tumor cell apoptosis , vascular injury , degrading metastasis potential and as well as inhibiting the immunosuppressive cell myeloid derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) recruitment . Further mechanistic studies will be performed to explore the quantitative relationship between tumor progression and thermal dose in the near future .
BACKGROUND DNA-damaging compounds ( e.g. , alkylating agents , cytotoxic antibiotics and DNA topoisomerase poisons ) are the most widely used anticancer drugs . The inability of tumor cells to properly repair some types of DNA damage may explain why specific DNA-damaging drugs can selectively kill tumor cells . Phenylglyoxal is a dicarbonyl compound known to react with guanidine groups such as that of the DNA base guanine , therefore suggesting that phenylglyoxal could induce DNA damage and have anticancer activity . METHODS Cellular DNA damage was measured by the alkaline comet assay and the \u03b3H2AX focus assay . Formation of topoisomerase I- and topoisomerase II-DNA complexes was assessed by the TARDIS assay , an immunofluorescence technique that employs specific antibodies to DNA topo I or topo II to detect the protein covalently bound to the DNA in individual cells . Cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity were determined by XTT , MTT and clonogenic assays . Apoptosis was assessed by the Annexin V flow cytometry assay . RESULTS Phenylglyoxal induced cellular DNA damage and formation of high levels of topoisomerase I- and topoisomerase II-DNA complexes in cells . These topoisomerase-DNA complexes were abolished by catalase pretreatment and correlated well with the induction of apoptosis . Phenylglyoxal-induced cell death was partially prevented by catalase pretreatment and was higher in lung cancer cells ( A549 ) than in normal lung fibroblasts ( MRC5 ) . Mammalian cell lines defective in nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) , homologous recombination ( HR ) and non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) were more sensitive to phenylglyoxal than parental cells ; this suggests that phenylglyoxal may induce bulky distortions in the shape of the DNA double helix ( which are repaired by the NER pathway ) and DNA double-strand breaks ( which are repaired by HR and NHEJ ) . CONCLUSION This report shows that phenylglyoxal is a new DNA-damaging agent with anticancer activity , and suggests that tumor cells with defects in NER , HR and NHEJ may be hypersensitive to the cytotoxic activity of phenylglyoxal .
Metastasis is the most lethal attribute of human malignancy . High-level expression of survivin is involved in both carcinogenesis and angiogenesis in cancer . Previous studies indicate that a mutation of the threonine residue at position 34 ( Thr34Ala ) of survivin generates a dominant-negative mutant that induces apoptosis , inhibits angiogenesis , and suppresses highly metastatic breast carcinoma in mouse models . We investigated the efficacy of gene therapy with a survivin dominant-negative mutant and possible factors related to lymph node metastasis . The metastasis rate was compared between each group in order to find a survivin-targeted therapy against lymphangiogenesis in its earliest stages . We established lymph node metastasis models and treated animals with H22 tumors with Lip-mSurvivinT34A ( Lip-mS ) , Lip-plasmid ( Lip-P ) , or normal saline ( NS ) . Eight days after the last dose , five randomly chosen mice from each group were sacrificed . We detected the apoptotic index , microvessel density ( MVD ) , lymphatic microvessel density ( LMVD ) , and the expression of VEGF-D with immunohistochemistry . After the remaining animals were sacrificed , we compared the tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes in each group . Administration of mSurvivinT34A plasmid complexed with cationic liposome ( DOTAP/chol ) resulted in the efficacious inhibition of tumor growth and lymph node metastasis within the mouse H22 tumor model . These responses were associated with tumor cell apoptosis , and angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis inhibition . Our results suggested that Lip-mSurvivinT34A induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis , thus suppressing tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis . The mSurvivinT34A survivin mutant is a promising strategy of gene therapy to inhibit lymphatic metastasis .
Nucling is a stress-inducible protein associated with apoptosomes . The cytochrome c-triggered formation of apoptosomes represents a key-initiating event in apoptosis . We have recently reported that Nucling regulates the apoptotic pathway by controlling the activation of NF-kappaB as well . Here we show that hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) arising spontaneously against a background of hepatitis occurred more frequently in Nucling-knockout ( KO ) mice than wild-type ( WT ) mice . Biochemical serum testing revealed potential liver dysfunction with hypercholesterolemia in Nucling-KO males . In the background of Nucling-KO mice , we observed the up-regulation of TNFalpha , spontaneous NF-kappaB-activation and the induction of galectin-3 expression in liver . In addition , we observed a decrease in the number of Kupffer cells ( KCs ) in the KO mice . KCs are important for the hepatic immune system , acting as phagocytes or antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) . We found that KCs in Nucling-KO mice were apoptotic possibly through the up-regulation of TNFalpha . These observations indicate that Nucling is important for the regulation of NF-kappaB signals in liver . We propose that Nucling deficiency could be a powerful tool to reveal the NF-kappaB-related molecular networks leading to hepatitis and HCC development .
Multivitamin preparation ( MVP ) is part of total parenteral nutrition given to premature infants . Photoactivated MVP carries an important load in peroxides , but their cellular effects have not yet been determined . We hypothesized that these peroxides may elicit a DNA-damage response . We found that photoactivation of MVP and the resulting peroxide production were time-dependent and required the simultaneous presence of ascorbic acid and riboflavin . Cells treated with photoactivated MVP showed strongly stimulated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation , an early DNA-damage response in mammals . Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation stimulation was dependent on the presence of ascorbic acid and riboflavin in the photoactivated MVP . It did not occur in the presence of a specific PARP inhibitor nor in mouse fibroblasts deficient in PARP-1 . Photoactivated MVP was able to induce single- and double-strand breaks in DNA , with a predominance of single-stand breaks . The presence of double-strand breaks was further confirmed using a 53PB1 focus analysis . Finally , photoactivated MVP was shown to be toxic to human cells and induced caspase-independent cell death . These results suggest that photoactivated MVP carries an important toxic load able to damage DNA and induce cell death . This study also emphasizes the importance of protecting MVP solution from light before use in preterm infants .
The aim of this study was to determine whether caffeine enhanced radiosensitivity of normal liver tissue in a rat radiation-induced liver disease model . Buffalo rat McA-RH7777 hepatocellular cancer cells and BRL3A normal liver cells were irradiated , and cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rates were analyzed . A rat model of radiation-induced liver disease was established , rats were randomized into four groups : control ; caffeine alone ; irradiation ( IR ) alone ; and caffeine plus IR ( Caff + IR ) group . Apoptosis rates in normal rat liver tissue after IR were evaluated by TUNEL staining and caspase-3 Western blot . Transaminase activity was measured and histopathological examination was done after IR . Caffeine abrogated IR-induced G2 phase arrest ( Caff + IR vs. IR : 40.9 +/- 4.0 vs. 60.7 +/- 5.5% , at 12 h after IR ) and increased apoptosis rates ( Caff + IR vs. IR : 56.1 +/- 6.8 vs. 35.5 +/- 4.0% , at 72 h after IR ) in McA-RH7777 cells , but did not affect IR-induced G2 phase arrest and apoptosis rates at any time point after IR in BRL3A cells . Caffeine did not enhance apoptosis , transaminase activity , or histopathological injury of normal rat liver tissue at any time points after IR . This study suggests that caffeine might not enhance radiosensitivity of normal liver tissue in vivo . In an earlier study , we reported that caffeine enhanced radiosensitivity of human hepatocellular cancer in a nude mice model . Together , these results offer feasibility of clinical application .
