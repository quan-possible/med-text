Cellular senescence forms a barrier that inhibits the acquisition of an immortal phenotype , a critical feature in tumorigenesis . The inactivation of multiple pathways that positively regulate senescence are required for immortalization . To identify these pathways in an unbiased manner , we performed DNA microarray analyses to assess the expression of 20,000 genes in human prostate epithelial cells ( HPECs ) passaged to senescence . These gene expression patterns were then compared with those of HPECs immortalized with the human Papillomavirus 16 E7 oncoprotein . Senescent cells display gene expression patterns that reflect their nonproliferative , differentiated phenotype and express secretory proteases and extracellular matrix components . A comparison of genes transcriptionally up-regulated in senescence to those in which expression is significantly down-regulated in immortalized HPECs identified three genes : the chemokine BRAK , DOC1 , and a member of the insulin-like growth factor axis , IGFBP-3 . Expression of these genes is found to be uniformly lost in human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts , and previously , their inactivation was documented in tumor samples . Thus , these genes may function in novel pathways that regulate senescence and are inactivated during immortalization . These changes may be critical not only in allowing cells to bypass senescence in vitro but in the progression of prostate cancer in vivo .
Human fibroblasts undergo cellular senescence after a finite number of divisions , in response to the erosion of telomeres . In addition to being terminally arrested in the cell cycle , senescent fibroblasts express genes that are normally induced upon wounding , including genes that remodel the extracellular matrix . We have identified the novel zinc finger protein APA-1 , whose expression increased in senescent human fibroblasts independent of telomere shortening . Extended passage , telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts had increased levels of APA-1 as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 . In fibroblasts , APA-1 was modified by the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1 , which increased APA-1 half-life , possibly by blocking ubiquitin-mediated degradation . Overexpression of APA-1 did not cause cell cycle arrest ; but , it induced transcription of the extracellular matrix-remodeling genes MMP1 and PAI2 , which are associated with fibroblast senescence . MMP1 and PAI2 transcript levels also increased in telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts that had high levels of APA-1 , demonstrating that the matrix-remodeling phenotype of senescent fibroblasts was not induced by telomere attrition alone . APA-1 was able to transactivate and bind to the MMP1 promoter , suggesting that APA-1 is a transcription factor that regulates expression of matrix-remodeling genes during fibroblast senescence .
To search for potential biomarkers used to monitor the process of immortalization , we investigated the relative level of telomerase activity and other immortal phenotypes in the SHEE esophageal epithelial cell line . This human fetal esophageal epithelial cell line , induced by human papilloma virus ( HPV ) 18 E6E7 , was continually propagated over 100 passages . Fourteenth passage cells ( SHEE14 ) were cultured in a flask with a serum-free medium and continually cultured to the 30th passage ( SHEE30 ) . Cells of SHEE14 , SHEE20 and SHEE30 were examined according to cell morphology , cell cycle , apoptosis , contact-inhibition growth , anchorage- dependency , dose-dependency to epithelial growth factors ( EGF ) , telomerase activity and tumorigenicity . The SHEE14 cells exhibited good differentiation with contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth . The SHEE20 cells exhibited increase of senescent and apoptotic cells , and difficulty in propagation . The SHEE30 cells exhibited a higher proliferative index and some undifferentiated cells , with weakened contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth . The telomerase was activated in cells of SHEE30 , but not in SHEE14 and SHEE20 cells . The different response to dose-dependency to EGF was not statistically different in SHEE14 and SHEE30 . Three groups of cells displayed lack of tumor formation in nude mice . Compared with SHEE14 and SHEE20 , SHEE30 cells were of immortalized status with immortal phenotype , which consisted of telomerase activity , increase of cell proliferation , weakened contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth , dose dependency to EGF and lack of tumor formation . From passage 14 to 30th passage , SHEE cells went through cellular senescence , apoptosis and immortalization . With a view toward diagnostic and biological aspects , telomerase activity is a crucial step and a cardinal requirement for immortalization . The telomerase activity and other immortal phenotypes are potential markers for monitoring the process of immortalization .
To examine the association of cell cycle regulatory gene inactivation with human cell immortalization , we determined the expression status of INK4a , Rb , and WAF1/ CIP1 , in eleven in vitro immortalized human cell lines , including fibroblasts and keratinocytes . Two human papillomavirus type 16 E6 expressing cell lines with telomerase activity , including a fibroblast cell line and a keratinocyte cell line , expressed no detectable p16(INK4a) . These cell lines had a hyperphosphorylated pRb and reduced expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) . All of seven fibroblast cell lines immortalized either spontaneously or by ( 60)Co , X-rays , 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide or aflatoxin B(1) , maintaining their telomeres by the ALT ( alternative lengthening of telomeres ) pathway , displayed loss of expression of p16(INK4a) and hyperphosphorylation of pRb . Levels of p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression varied among the cell lines . Two fibroblast cell lines that became immortalized following infection with a retrovirus vector encoding human telomerase catalytic subunit ( hTERT ) cDNA were also accompanied by inactivation of p16(INK4a) and pRb pathways . Acquisition of telomerase activity alone was not sufficient for immortalization of these cell lines . Taken together , all the cell lines including fibroblasts and keratinocytes , with either telomerase activity or the ALT pathway for telomere maintenance showed loss of expression of p16(INK4a) and hyperphosphorylation of pRb . These demonstrate the association of inactivation of both p16(INK4a) and pRb with immortalization of human cells including fibroblasts and epithelial cells and telomerase-positive cells and ALT-positive cells .
Human carcinomas are defined by recurrent chromosomal aneuploidies , which result in a tissue-specific distribution of genomic imbalances . In order to develop models for these genome mutations and to determine their role in tumorigenesis , we generated 45 spontaneously transformed murine cell lines from normal epithelial cells derived from bladder , cervix , colon , kidney , lung , and mammary gland . Phenotypic changes , chromosomal aberrations , centrosome number , and telomerase activity were assayed in control uncultured cells and in three subsequent stages of transformation . Supernumerary centrosomes , binucleate cells , and tetraploidy were observed as early as 48 hr after explantation . In addition , telomerase activity increased throughout progression . Live-cell imaging revealed that failure of cytokinesis , not cell fusion , promoted genome duplication . Spectral karyotyping demonstrated that aneuploidy preceded immortalization , consisting predominantly of whole chromosome losses ( 4 , 9 , 12 , 13 , 16 , and Y ) and gains ( 1 , 10 , 15 , and 19 ) . After transformation , focal amplifications of the oncogenes Myc and Mdm2 were frequently detected . Fifty percent of the transformed lines resulted in tumors on injection into immunocompromised mice . The phenotypic and genomic alterations observed in spontaneously transformed murine epithelial cells recapitulated the aberration pattern observed during human carcinogenesis . The dominant aberration of these cell lines was the presence of specific chromosomal aneuploidies . We propose that our newly derived cancer models will be useful tools to dissect the sequential steps of genome mutations during malignant transformation , and also to identify cancer-specific genes , signaling pathways , and the role of chromosomal instability in this process .
The Ras association domain family 1 isoform A ( RASSF1A ) is a tumor suppressor whose inactivation is implicated in the development of many human cancers , including breast carcinomas . Little is known about the tumor-suppressive function of RASSF1A in breast tissue and whether its inactivation is mechanistically involved in the initiation and progression of breast tumors . Here , we show that RASSF1A inhibits breast cancer growth in vivo , and suppresses estrogen receptor ( ERalpha ) expression and function . Reconstitution of RASSF1A in MCF7 cells led to decreased ERalpha levels and reduced sensitivity to estrogen ( E2 ) . Concomitantly , we observed decreased expression of Id1 as well as the E2-responsive genes Bcl-2 and c-Myc that cooperatively contribute to the immortalization and transformation of breast epithelial cells . This downregulation was associated with induction of cell-cycle arrest and senescence that constitute early barriers to cancer initiation and progression . Knockdown of ERalpha showed that downregulation of ERalpha suffices to increase senescence and inhibit expression of Bcl-2 , c-Myc and Id1 . However , enforced expression of ERalpha only partially rescued RASSF1A-mediated growth inhibition and senescence , suggesting that suppression of ERalpha expression and activity is not the only mechanism by which RASSF1A inhibits growth and survival of breast cancer cells . Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 , c-Myc and Id1 had little or no effect on RASSF1A-mediated growth arrest , indicating that RASSF1A acts dominantly over these oncogenes . Mechanistically , RASSF1A was found to suppress ERalpha expression through Akt1 . It also transiently inhibited ERalpha-induced Ras-MAPK activity after exposure of cells to E2 . Together , our data show that RASSF1A acts as a tumor suppressor in ERalpha+ mammary epithelial cells , in part through inhibiting ERalpha expression and activity . These findings suggest that RASSF1A has a key role in suppressing the transformation of human breast epithelial cells and ERalpha+ breast cancer initiation .
Senescence , an inherent tumor suppressive mechanism , is a critical determinant for chemotherapy . In the present study , we show that the monocarboxylate transporter 2 ( MCT2 ) protein was tumor-selectively expressed in human colorectal malignancies and knockdown of MCT2 induces mitochondrial dysfunction , cell-cycle arrest , and senescence without additional cellular stress in colorectal cancer cell lines . Moreover , the reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) scavenger , N-acetylcysteine , blocked MCT2 knockdown-induced growth arrest and cellular senescence , indicating a pivotal role of ROS in this pathway . Dramatic induction of mitochondrial superoxide generation and decrease in ATP production was observed , indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction is the major mechanism underlying MCT2 knockdown-induced ROS generation . Senescence-associated DNA damage was also evident from the increase in promyelocytic leukemia bodies , gammaH2AX foci , and SAHF . Conversely , overexpression of MCT2 prevented doxorubicin-induced ROS accumulation ( P = 0.0002 ) and cell growth inhibition ( P = 0.001 ) . MCT2 knockdown suppressed KRAS mutant colorectal tumor growth in vivo . In addition , MCT2 knockdown and cytostatic drug combination further enhanced the antitumor effect . These findings support the use of MCT2 as a promising target for inhibition of colorectal cancer .
The molecular mechanism mediating expression of senescent cell antigen-aggregated or cleaved band 3 and externalized phosphatidylserine ( PS ) on the surface of aged erythrocytes and their premature expression in certain anemias is not completely elucidated . The erythrocytes with these surface modifications undergo macrophage-mediated phagocytosis . In this study , the role of protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoforms in the expression of these surface modifications was investigated . Inhibition of PKC alpha by 30 muM rottlerin ( R30 ) and 2.3 nM G<FFFD> 6976 caused expression of both the senescent cell marker-externalized PS measured by FACS analysis and aggregated band 3 detected by western blotting . In contrast to this observation , but in keeping with literature , PKC activation by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate ( PMA ) also led to the expression of senescence markers . We explain this antithesis by demonstrating that PMA-treated cells show reduction in the activity of PKC alpha , thereby simulating inhibition . The reduction in PKC alpha activity may be attributed to the known downregulation of PMA-activated PKC alpha , caused by its membrane translocation and proteolysis . We demonstrate membrane translocation of PKC alpha in PMA-treated cells to substantiate this inference . Thus loss of PKC alpha activity either by inhibition or downregulation can cause surface modifications which can trigger erythrophagocytosis .
Retinoic acid ( RA)-induced differentiation therapy is partially successful in neuroblastoma treatment . We found that a novel combination of vanadium-based PTP inhibitors with RA induced extensive differentiation in neuroblastoma cells . In contrast to RA alone , this led to either permanent differentiation or senescence after 14days of combined treatment followed by chemical removal . Senescence was dependent in part on synergistic AKT and ERK activation. p21 was also strongly induced , but in contrast to oncogene-induced senescence , p53 was not activated . Vanadium-based inhibitors thus serve strongly to enhance RA's ability to drive differentiation and a novel form of senescence in neuroblastoma cells .
The mammalian COP9 signalosome ( CSN ) complex is involved in cell transformation , but its molecular mechanism remains undetermined . Here we show that disruption of the fifth component ( CSN5 ) prevented the formation of tumors by p53-null cells transformed with an active form of Ras in subcutaneously injected mice . Depletion of CSN5 suppressed cell proliferation , and induced premature senescence characterized by upregulation of senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase activity and increased expression of CDK inhibitors . CSN5-depleted cells exhibited enhanced activation of the PI3 kinase-Akt pathway , and chemical inhibition of this pathway reduced the level of senescence . Thus , CSN5 is suggested to be a novel target in cancer therapy and for drugs against tumor cells harboring mutated p53 .
Cellular senescence is considered as a tumor suppressive mechanism . Recent evidence indicates however that senescent cells secrete various growth factors and cytokines , some of which may paradoxically promote cancer progression . This phenomenon termed senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) must be inhibited in order for anti-proliferative agents to be effective . The present study was designed to determine whether the beta-catenin destruction complex ( BCDC ) , known to integrate the action of various growth factors and cytokines , would represent a suitable target to inhibit the activity of SASP components . For this , we carried out experiments to determine the effect of drug-induced senescence on secretion of SASP , beta-catenin transactivation , and the relationship between these processes . Moreover , genetic and pharmacological approaches were used to define the implication of BCDC in mediating the effects of SASP components on cell migration and resistance to drugs . The findings indicate that drug-induced senescence was associated with expression of various Wnt ligands in addition to previously known SASP components . Beta catenin transactivation and expression of genes implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) also increased in response to drug-induced SASP . These effects were prevented by Pyrvinium , a recently described activator of BCDC . Pyrvinium also suppressed the effects of SASP on cell migration and resistance to doxorubicin . Together , these findings provide insights on the potential role of BCDC in mediating the effects of drug-induced SASP on cancer cell invasion and resistance to therapy , and suggest that targeting this pathway may represent an effective approach to enhance the activity of current and prospective anti-cancer therapeutics .
