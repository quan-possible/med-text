In human fibroblasts , the expression of SV40 large T antigen is known to cause a variety of chromosomal aberrations and especially dicentric chromosomes . In some cases , the later aberrations have been reported to be reversible telomeric associations . We report here aberration and chromosome number studies of twenty-nine T antigen positive lineages , studied from their initiation by transfection of T antigen sequences into human diploid fibroblasts , until crisis or immortalization occurred or , in some cases until the lines became tumorigenic in nude mice . The data show that T antigen consistently produced chromosomal instability of both number and structure by an active process that began before transformation indicators were positive and continued throughout neoplastic progression . The most frequently observed aberrations were dicentric chromosomes , which were shown to be true dicentrics by examination by in situ hybridization with telomeric sequences . These data are consistent with the hypothesis that T antigen causes human fibroblasts to become neoplastically transformed by successive rounds of chromosomal mutation and lineage evolution .
The mouse polyomavirus encodes a tumor-suppressor gene inactivator in its large T protein and a proto-oncogene activator in its middle T protein . We have used site-directed mutagenesis to selectively inactivate the former function without affecting the latter . Two mutant viruses were constructed to encode altered large T proteins that fail to bind the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene product pRB , along with normal small and middle T proteins . The pRB-binding mutants proved to be defective in immortalization of primary rat embryo fibroblasts by a variety of tests . Yet they proved capable of transforming both primary and established fibroblasts in culture . Most importantly , the inability of these mutants to bind pRB had little effect on their ability to induce tumors in mice . We conclude that induction of multiple tumor types in this system does not depend on large T-pRB interactions but rather on middle T-dependent pathways . In addition , the ability of this virus to immortalize cells in culture is not essential to its ability to induce tumors in the animal .
A panel of primary human cells and virus-transformed derivatives were tested for events that coincide with immortalization . In all primary and precrisis cells , two proteins of 92 and 150 kDa that shared an epitope with p53 were found ; in most of their immortalized derivatives , however , they were absent . Expression of these proteins may be involved in senescence .
The ras oncogenes alone fully transform established ( immortalized ) rodent fibroblasts in a few days , but generally transform early-passage fibroblasts only partially , unless their action is complemented by that of a nuclear , immortalizing , oncogene . Here we show that transfection of second-passage Syrian hamster embryo fibroblasts ( HEFs ) by the EJ-H-ras oncogene coupled to the neo gene , followed by selection with G418 , gives rise to apparently normal , or only slightly transformed , clonal colonies , only a few of which become established . The study of two established clonal lines showed that they acquired only after some weeks , and stepwise , the main characteristics of full neoplastic transformation , i.e. anchorage independence , reduced requirement for serum growth factors and tumorigenicity . Later both clonal lines became increasingly tumorigenic and completely independent of exogenous growth and attachment factors , without increase in the expression of the H-ras oncogene . Transfection of one of the clones , early after its isolation , with a truncated derivative of the nuclear v-myb oncogene devoid of its transcriptional negative regulatory domain and able to partially transform chicken embryo fibroblasts [ (myb(KXANM) ] gave rise to more transformed cells , expressing both EJ-H-ras and myb(KXANM) , which became tumorigenic earlier than the controls and remained more tumorigenic later on . With more efficient transfection techniques , numerous foci of fully transformed cells were subsequently obtained , in a few days , in cultures transfected sequentially with EJ-H-ras(neo) and myb(KXANM) and in cultures co-transfected with the two oncogenes . Highly tumorigenic , serum-independent and immortalized clones expressing both oncogenes were obtained from these cultures . Hence , the truncated myb(KXANM) oncogene accelerate the stepwise transformation of unestablished HEFs by the EJ-HH-ras oncogene and , together with this oncogene , fully transforms these same cells in a single step . The two oncogenes acting in cooperation also induce cell immortalization , but myb(KXANM) , by itself , is not an immortalizing oncogene . No cooperation was observed between EJ-H-ras(neo) and the unaltered v-myb oncogene .
p53 and INK4a/ARF mutations promote tumorigenesis and drug resistance , in part , by disabling apoptosis . We show that primary murine lymphomas also respond to chemotherapy by engaging a senescence program controlled by p53 and p16(INK4a) . Hence , tumors with p53 or INK4a/ARF mutations-but not those lacking ARF alone-respond poorly to cyclophosphamide therapy in vivo . Moreover , tumors harboring a Bcl2-mediated apoptotic block undergo a drug-induced cytostasis involving the accumulation of p53 , p16(INK4a) , and senescence markers , and typically acquire p53 or INK4a mutations upon progression to a terminal stage . Finally , mice bearing tumors capable of drug-induced senescence have a much better prognosis following chemotherapy than those harboring tumors with senescence defects . Therefore , cellular senescence contributes to treatment outcome in vivo .
Elevated insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1 ( IGFBP-rP1 ) mRNA in senescent human mammary epithelial cells suggested that the IGFBP-3 gene product may inhibit cell proliferation . To test this hypothesis , we used a retroviral vector to express IGFBP-rP1 cDNA in the IGFBP-rP1-deficient MCF-7 breast cancer cell line . Compared with control vector-transduced cells , cumulative cell numbers for IGFBP-rP1-transduced polyclonal or clonal cell cultures were reduced by 39 and 74% , respectively , after 1 week . Medium conditioned by IGFBP-rP1-producing cultures reduced cumulative cell numbers in parental MCF-7 cultures by 20% compared with medium from cultures of a control vector-transduced cell line . Nuclear fragmentation analysis and cell proliferation assays completed in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone excluded apoptosis as the responsible mechanism . The percentage of cells containing senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity was doubled compared with control cell cultures . Flow cytometry analysis indicated that twice as many noncycling cells were present in the IGFBP-rP1-transduced MCF-7 cell cultures compared with controls . These findings indicate that IGFBP-rP1 is an inhibitor of MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation and may act via a cellular senescence-like mechanism .
We have modelled multiple stages of malignant transformation of human endothelial cells ( ECs ) by overexpressing the catalytic subunit of human telomerase ( hTERT ) , together with SV40 T antigen ( SV40T ) and oncogenic N-ras . Transfection with hTERT alone , led to the immortalization of two out of three cultures of bone marrow-derived ECs ( BMECs ) . One hTERT transduced BMEC culture underwent a long proliferative lag before resuming proliferation . BMECs transfected with hTERT alone were functionally and phenotypically normal . BMECs transfected with SV40T ( BMSVTs ) had an extended lifespan , but eventually succumbed to crisis . BMSVTs exhibited a partially transformed phenotype , demonstrating growth factor independence , altered antigen expression and forming tiny , infrequent colonies in vitro . Transduction of BMSVTs with hTERT resulted in immortalization of 4 out of 4 cultures . BMSVTs immortalized with hTERT formed large colonies in vitro and small transient tumours in vivo . BMECs co-expressing SV40T , hTERT and N-ras exhibited an overtly transformed phenotype ; forming very large colonies with an altered morphology and generating rapidly growing tumours in vivo . These investigations demonstrate transformation of human ECs to an overtly malignant phenotype . This model will be useful for understanding mechanisms underlying vascular and angiogenic neoplasias , as well as for testing drugs designed to curtail aberrant EC growth .
Id proteins are negative regulators of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors , which are critical for expression of genes associated with cellular differentiation . Previous studies have shown that overexpression of Id-1 delays cellular senescence in several cell types , including fibroblasts , mammary epithelial cells , and keratinocytes . Although previous studies have demonstrated the expression of Id-1 in endothelium , the regulation of Id-1 has not been studied in these cells . In this report , a retroviral vector was used to overexpress Id-1 in human endothelial cells . Sustained expression of Id-1 resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the total number of population doublings ( replicative capacity ) of the cells compared with vector-treated controls , which correlated with low levels of p16 , p21 , and p27 expression . The cells , however , were not immortalized and did eventually undergo senescence despite elevated Id-1 levels . Senescence was characterized by a dramatic increase in p16 , but not p21 and p27 . Under these experimental conditions , telomerase activity was not detected and the telomeres became progressively shorter with time . These results demonstrate the importance of Id-1 in endothelial cell proliferation and indicate that Id-1 represses p16 expression , resulting in delayed senescence . These findings may have implications in the development of endothelial cell-derived tumors .
The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that arise from mammary epithelial cells ( MECs ) . One of the key early events in tumorigenic transformation is the ability of cells to overcome replicative senescence . However , the precise genetic changes that are responsible for this event in MECs is largely unknown . Here , we report that Bmi-1 , originally identified as a c-Myc cooperating oncoprotein , can bypass senescence , extend the replicative life span , and immortalize MECs . Furthermore , Bmi-1 was overexpressed in immortal MECs and several breast cancer cell lines . Overexpression of Bmi-1 in MECs led to activation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) transcription and induction of telomerase activity . Telomerase induction by Bmi-1 was an early event in the extension of the replicative life span and immortalization . Bmi-1 was not overexpressed in hTERT-immortalized MECs , suggesting that Bmi-1 functions upstream of hTERT . Although , c-Myc has been reported to induce telomerase in MECs , Bmi-1 appeared to act independently of c-Myc binding sequences in the hTERT promoter . Deletion analysis of the Bmi-1 protein suggested that the RING finger , as well as a conserved helix-turn-helix-turn domain , were required for its ability to induce telomerase and immortalize MECs . These data suggest that Bmi-1 regulates telomerase expression in MECs and plays a role in the development of human breast cancer .
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Mre11p , Rad50p , and Xrs2p function as a multiprotein complex that has a central role in several DNA repair mechanisms . Though Mre11p has both single-stranded and double-stranded 3'-5 ' exonuclease activity in vitro , null mutants of MRE11 , RAD50 , and XRS2 exhibit reduced 5'-3 ' resection of HO-induced double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) in vivo . In this study , we analyzed four mre11 mutants harboring changes in the N-terminus of Mre11p where the four phosphoesterase motifs specify the in vitro nuclease activities of Mre11p and its homologues . We find that the 5'-3 ' resection defects in vivo do not correlate with several mitotic phenotypes : non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) , telomere length maintenance , and adaptation to the DNA damage-inducible G2/M checkpoint . Overexpression of the 5'-3 ' exonuclease Exo1p in a mre11Delta strain partially increased 5'-3 ' resection and partially suppressed both methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) hypersensitivity and adaptation phenotypes , but did not affect telomere length or NHEJ . Surprisingly , the co-expression of two alleles , mre11-58S and mre11-N113S , each of which confers MMS hypersensitivity and short telomeres , can fully complement the MMS sensitivity and shortened telomere length of mre11Delta cells . We propose that at least two separate activities associated with the N-terminus of Mre11p are required for its mitotic function .
The telomerase activity and the senescence profile of cultured breast fibroblasts from normal human interstitial and malignant stromal tissue were studied in comparison with their proliferation and differentiation pattern . Fibroblasts were grown either in the presence or absence of a conditioned medium ( CM ) obtained from cultures of the oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer MCF-7 cell line . At different passages ( from the 2nd up to the 48th ) , fibroblasts were examined for the telomerase activity by the Telomerase Repeats Amplification Protocol ( TRAP ) assay , for proliferation profile by Ki-67 antigen expression , and the myofibroblast or smooth muscle cell-like differentiation pattern by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies specific for smooth muscle markers . Serial passages of fibroblasts from normal or tumour breast reveal that the relationship between the levels of telomerase activity and phenotypic/proliferation profile changes with cell subcultivation in a different manner in the two cell populations . The fibroblasts from normal tissue completed 12 passages in a CM-independent way prior to senescence whereas fibroblasts from tumour stroma senescence were attained after 48 passages . These cells showed a marked decrease of telomerase activity , growth rate and smooth muscle alpha-actin expressing myofibroblasts after the 32nd passage . CM treatment of this fibroblast population induces a decline in the myofibroblast content , which precedes the changes in telomerase activity . Passaged fibroblasts from normal breast tissue can be converted to myofibroblasts upon CM treatment whereas those from tumour stroma were CM-insensitive . Taken together our data suggest that a heterogeneous fibroblast population with different life span is activated/recruited in the breast interstitium and poses the problem of a unique activation/recruitment of fibroblasts in neoplastic conditions .
The c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase ( JNK ) signaling cascade has been implicated in a wide range of diseases , including cancer . It is unclear how different JNK proteins contribute to human cancer . Here , we report that JNK2 is activated in more than 70% of human squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) samples and that inhibition of JNK2 pharmacologically or genetically impairs tumorigenesis of human SCC cells . Most importantly , JNK2 , but not JNK1 , is sufficient to couple with oncogenic Ras to transform primary human epidermal cells into malignancy with features of SCC . JNK2 prevents Ras-induced cell senescence and growth arrest by reducing the expression levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p16 and the activation of NF-kappaB . On the other hand , JNK , along with phosphoinositide 3-kinase , is essential for Ras-induced glycolysis , an energy-producing process known to benefit cancer growth . These data indicate that JNK2 collaborates with other oncogenes , such as Ras , at multiple molecular levels to promote tumorigenesis and hence represents a promising therapeutic target for cancer .
Pegylated Interferon-alpha2b ( pIFN-alpha ) is an integral part of the drug regimen currently employed against melanoma . Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the IFN response , cell cycle and apoptosis . We have studied pIFN-alpha induced responses when combined with the chemotherapy agent , vinblastine in tumor and endothelial cell lines and the connection to IRF-1 signaling . Levels of IRF-1/IRF-2 protein expression were found to be decreased in tumor versus normal tissues. pIFN-alpha induced IRF-1 signaling in human melanoma ( M14 ) and endothelial ( EA.hy926 ) cells and enhanced cell death when combined with vinblastine . Upon combined IFN-alpha and vinblastine treatment , p21 expression , PARP cleavage and activated Bak levels were increased in M14 cells . An increase in p21 and cyclin D1 expression occurred in EA.hy926 cells after 6 h of treatment with pIFN-alpha which dissipated by 24 h . This biphasic response , characteristic of cellular senescence , was more pronounced upon combined treatment . Exposure of the EA.hy926 cells to pIFN-alpha was associated with an enlarged , multinucleated , beta-galactosidase-positive senescent phenotype . The overall therapeutic mechanism of IFN-alpha combined with chemotherapy may be due to both direct tumor cell death via IRF-1 signaling and by premature senescence of endothelial cells and subsequent effects on angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment .
CDKN1C/P57 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor implicated in different human cancers , including hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) ; however , little is known regarding the role of CDKN1C/P57 and its regulation in HCC . In this study , we show that the down-regulation of Notch1 and Notch3 in two HCC cell lines resulted in Hes1 down-regulation , CDKN1C/P57 up-regulation , and reduced cell growth . In line with these data , we report that CDKN1C/P57 is a target of transcriptional repression by the Notch effector , Hes1 . We found that the up-regulation of CDKN1C/P57 by cDNA transfection decreased tumor growth , as determined by growth curve , flow cytometry analysis , and cyclin D1 down-regulation , without affecting the apoptosis machinery . Indeed , the expression of Bax , Noxa , PUMA , BNIP(3) , and cleaved caspase-3 was not affected by CDKN1C/P57 induction . Morphologically CDKN1C/p57-induced HCC cells became flat and lengthened in shape , accumulated the senescence-associated beta-galactosidase marker , and increased P16 protein expression . Evaluation of senescence in cells depleted both for Hes1 and CDKN1C/P57 revealed that the senescent state really depends on the accumulation of CDKN1C/p57 . Finally , we validated our in vitro results in primary HCCs , showing that Hes1 protein expression inversely correlates with CDKN1C/P57 mRNA levels . In addition , reduced Hes1 protein expression is accompanied by a shorter time to recurrence after curative resection , suggesting that Hes1 may represent a biomarker for prediction of patients with poor prognosis .
The Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres ( ALT ) pathway is a telomerase-independent pathway for telomere maintenance that is active in a significant subset of human cancers and in vitro immortalized cell lines . ALT is thought to involve templated extension of telomeres through homologous recombination , but the genetic or epigenetic changes that unleash ALT are not known . Recently , mutations in the ATRX/DAXX chromatin remodeling complex and histone H3.3 were found to correlate with features of ALT in pancreatic neuroendocrine cancers , pediatric glioblastomas , and other tumors of the central nervous system , suggesting that these mutations might contribute to the activation of the ALT pathway in these cancers . We have taken a comprehensive approach to deciphering ALT by applying genomic , molecular biological , and cell biological approaches to a panel of 22 ALT cell lines , including cell lines derived in vitro . Here we show that loss of ATRX protein and mutations in the ATRX gene are hallmarks of ALT-immortalized cell lines . In addition , ALT is associated with extensive genome rearrangements , marked micronucleation , defects in the G2/M checkpoint , and altered double-strand break ( DSB ) repair . These attributes will facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of ALT positive human cancers .
Cellular senescence has emerged as a critical tumor suppressive mechanism in recent years , but relatively little is known about how senescence occurs . Here , we report that secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 ( SFRP1 ) , a secreted antagonist of Wnt signaling , is oversecreted upon cellular senescence caused by DNA damage or oxidative stress . SFRP1 is necessary for stress-induced senescence caused by these factors and is sufficient for the induction of senescence phenotypes . We present evidence suggesting that SFRP1 functions as a secreted mediator of senescence through inhibition of Wnt signaling and activation of the retinoblastoma ( Rb ) pathway and that cancer-associated SFRP1 mutants are defective for senescence induction .
Premature senescence , a key strategy used to suppress carcinogenesis , can be driven by p53/p21 proteins in response to various stresses . Here , we demonstrate that Wig1 plays a critical role in this process through regulation of p21 mRNA stability . Wig1 controls the association of Argonaute2 ( Ago2 ) , a central component of the RNA-induced silencing complex ( RISC ) , with target p21 mRNA via binding of the stem-loop structure near the microRNA ( miRNA ) target site . Depletion of Wig1 prohibited miRNA-mediated p21 mRNA decay and resulted in premature senescence . Wig1 plays an essential role in cell proliferation , as demonstrated in tumour xenografts in mice , and Wig1 and p21 mRNA levels are inversely correlated in human normal and cancer tissues . Together , our data indicate a novel role of Wig1 in RISC target accessibility , which is a key step in RNA-mediated gene silencing . In addition , these findings indicate that fine-tuning of p21 levels by Wig1 is essential for the prevention of cellular senescence .
We previously demonstrated that downregulation of protein kinase CKII induces cellular senescence in human colon cancer HCT116 cells . To investigate the role of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) in CKII downregulation during senescence , we employed computational algorithms . Four miRNAs ( miR-186 , miR-216b , miR-337-3p , and miR-760 ) were predicted to be miRNAs against CKIIalpha mRNA . Mimics of all four miRNAs jointly downregulated CKIIalpha expression in HCT116 cells . Reporter analysis and RT-PCR have suggested that these four miRNAs may stimulate degradation of CKIIalpha mRNA by targeting its 3 ' untranslated regions ( UTRs ) . The four miRNA mimics increased senescent-associated beta-galactosidase ( SA-beta-gal ) staining , p53 and p21(Cip1/WAF1) expression , and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production . In contrast , concomitant knockdown of the four miRNAs by antisense inhibitors increased the CKIIalpha protein level and suppressed CKII inhibition-mediated senescence . Finally , CKIIalpha overexpression antagonized senescence induced by the four miRNA mimics . Therefore , the present results show that miR-186 , miR-216b , miR-337-3p , and miR-760 cooperatively promote cellular senescence through the p53-p21(Cip1/WAF1) pathway by CKII downregulation-mediated ROS production in HCT116 cells .
Cellular senescence is a permanent out-of-cycle state regulated by molecular circuits acting during the G1 phase of the cell cycle . Cdt1 is a central regulator of DNA replication licensing acting during the G1 phase and it is negatively controlled by Geminin . Here , we characterize the cell cycle expression pattern of Cdt1 and Geminin during successive passages of primary fibroblasts and compare it to tumour-derived cell lines . Cdt1 and Geminin are strictly expressed in distinct subpopulations of young fibroblasts , similarly to cancer cells , with Geminin accumulating shortly after the onset of S phase . Cdt1 and Geminin are down-regulated when primary human and mouse fibroblasts undergo replicative or stress-induced senescence . RNAi-mediated Geminin knock-down in human cells enhances the appearance of phenotypic and molecular features of senescence . Mouse embryonic fibroblasts heterozygous for Geminin exhibit accelerated senescence compared to control fibroblasts . In contrast , ectopic expression of Geminin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts delays the appearance of the senescent phenotype . Taken together , our data suggest that changes in Geminin expression levels affect the establishment of senescence pathways .
Oncogene-induced senescence can provide a protective mechanism against tumour progression . However , production of cytokines and growth factors by senescent cells may contribute to tumour development . Thus , it is unclear whether induction of senescence represents a viable therapeutic approach . Here , using a mouse model with orthotopic implantation of metastatic melanoma tumours taken from 19 patients , we observed that targeting aurora kinases with MLN8054/MLN8237 impaired mitosis , induced senescence and markedly blocked proliferation in patient tumour implants . Importantly , when a subset of tumour-bearing mice were monitored for tumour progression after pausing MLN8054 treatment , 50% of the tumours did not progress over a 12-month period . Mechanistic analyses revealed that inhibition of aurora kinases induced polyploidy and the ATM/Chk2 DNA damage response , which mediated senescence and a NF-kappaB-related , senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) . Blockade of IKKbeta/NF-kappaB led to reversal of MLN8237-induced senescence and SASP . Results demonstrate that removal of senescent tumour cells by infiltrating myeloid cells is crucial for inhibition of tumour re-growth . Altogether , these data demonstrate that induction of senescence , coupled with immune surveillance , can limit melanoma growth .
Genomic instability drives tumorigenesis , but how it is initiated in sporadic neoplasias is unknown . In early preneoplasias , alterations at chromosome fragile sites arise due to DNA replication stress . A frequent , perhaps earliest , genetic alteration in preneoplasias is deletion within the fragile FRA3B/FHIT locus , leading to loss of Fhit protein expression . Because common chromosome fragile sites are exquisitely sensitive to replication stress , it has been proposed that their clonal alterations in cancer cells are due to stress sensitivity rather than to a selective advantage imparted by loss of expression of fragile gene products . Here , we show in normal , transformed , and cancer-derived cell lines that Fhit-depletion causes replication stress-induced DNA double-strand breaks . Using DNA combing , we observed a defect in replication fork progression in Fhit-deficient cells that stemmed primarily from fork stalling and collapse . The likely mechanism for the role of Fhit in replication fork progression is through regulation of Thymidine kinase 1 expression and thymidine triphosphate pool levels ; notably , restoration of nucleotide balance rescued DNA replication defects and suppressed DNA breakage in Fhit-deficient cells . Depletion of Fhit did not activate the DNA damage response nor cause cell cycle arrest , allowing continued cell proliferation and ongoing chromosomal instability . This finding was in accord with in vivo studies , as Fhit knockout mouse tissue showed no evidence of cell cycle arrest or senescence yet exhibited numerous somatic DNA copy number aberrations at replication stress-sensitive loci . Furthermore , cells established from Fhit knockout tissue showed rapid immortalization and selection of DNA deletions and amplifications , including amplification of the Mdm2 gene , suggesting that Fhit loss-induced genome instability facilitates transformation . We propose that loss of Fhit expression in precancerous lesions is the first step in the initiation of genomic instability , linking alterations at common fragile sites to the origin of genome instability .
In normal human cells , oncogene-induced senescence ( OIS ) depends on induction of DNA damage response . Oxidative stress and hyperreplication of genomic DNA have been proposed as major causes of DNA damage in OIS cells . Here , we report that down-regulation of deoxyribonucleoside pools is another endogenous source of DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts ( NHFs ) undergoing HRAS(G12V)-induced senescence . NHF-HRAS(G12V) cells underexpressed thymidylate synthase ( TS ) and ribonucleotide reductase ( RR ) , two enzymes required for the entire de novo deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis , and possessed low dNTP levels . Chromatin at the promoters of the genes encoding TS and RR was enriched with retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein and histone H3 tri-methylated at lysine 9 . Importantly , ectopic coexpression of TS and RR or addition of deoxyribonucleosides substantially suppressed DNA damage , senescence-associated phenotypes , and proliferation arrest in two types of NHF-expressing HRAS(G12V) . Reciprocally , short hairpin RNA-mediated suppression of TS and RR caused DNA damage and senescence in NHFs , although less efficiently than HRAS(G12V) . However , overexpression of TS and RR in quiescent NHFs did not overcome proliferation arrest , suggesting that unlike quiescence , OIS requires depletion of dNTP pools and activated DNA replication . Our data identify a previously unknown role of deoxyribonucleotides in regulation of OIS .
Lowering the threshold of cellular senescence , the process employed by cells to thwart abnormal cell proliferation , though inhibition of CDK2 or Skp2 ( regulator of CDK inhibitors ) has been recently suggested as a potential avenue for cancer treatment . In this study , we employ a published mathematical model of G1/S transition involving the DNA-damage signal transduction pathway to conduct carefully constructed computational experiments to highlight the effectiveness of manipulating cellular senescence in inhibiting damaged cell proliferation . We first demonstrate the suitability of the mathematical model to explore senescence by highlighting the overlap between senescence pathways and those involved in G1/S transition and DNA damage signal transduction . We then investigate the effect of CDK2 deficiency on senescence in healthy cells , followed by effectiveness of CDK2 deficiency in triggering senescence in DNA damaged cells . For this , we focus on the behaviour of CycE , whose peak response indicates G1/S transition , for several reduced CDK2 levels in healthy as well as two DNA-damage conditions to calculate the probability ( \u03b2 ) or the percentage of CDK2 deficient cells passing G1/S checkpoint ( (1-\u03b2) indicates level of senescence ) . Results show that 50% CDK2 deficiency can cause senescence in all healthy cells in a fairly uniform cell population ; whereas , most healthy cells ( \u224867% ) in a heterogeneous population escape senescence . This finding is novel to our study . Under both low- and high-DNA damaged conditions , 50% CDK deficiency can cause 65% increase in senescence in a heterogeneous cell population . Furthermore , the model analyses the relationship between CDK2 and its CKIs ( p21 , p27 ) to help search for other effective ways to bring forward cellular senescence . Results show that the degradation rate of p21 and initial concentration of p27 are effective in lowering CDK2 levels to lower the senescence threshold . Specifically , CDK2 and p27 are the most effective in triggering senescence while p21 having a smaller influence . While receiving experimental support , these findings specify in detail the inhibitory effects of CKIs . However , simultaneous variation of CDK2 and CKIs produces a dramatic reduction of damage cells passing the G1/S with CDK2&p27 combination causing senescence in almost all damaged cells . This combined effect of CDK2&CKIs on senescence is a novel contribution in this study . A review of the crucial protein complexes revealed that the concentration of active CycE/CDK2-p that controls cell cycle arrest provides support for the above findings with CycE/CDK2-p undergoing the largest reduction ( over 100% ) under the combined CDK2&CKI conditions leading to the arrest of most of the damaged cells . Our study thus provides quantitative assessments for the previously published qualitative findings on senescence and highlights new avenues for bringing forward senescence bar .
