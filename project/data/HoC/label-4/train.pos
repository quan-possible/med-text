We have isolated rabbit kidney proximal tubular epithelial cell lines . The selection was based on their ability to form confluent monolayers on porous supports and to maintain receptor-mediated signal transduction and ion transport , characteristic of the proximal tubule . The isolation method consisted of several steps : ( 1 ) superficial cortical proximal tubule segments were microdissected and cultured on a matrix-coated porous support until cells formed a confluent monolayer ; ( 2 ) primary cultures showing hormone-regulated ion transport typical for the proximal tubule were selected and co-cultured with irradiated fibroblasts ; and ( 3 ) the epithelial cells surviving after several passages were expanded and passaged on porous substrates . Most of the cell lines developed in this manner were obtained by co-culture with irradiated fibroblasts producing a recombinant retrovirus encoding SV40 large T antigen and G418 resistance . However , SV40 T antigen expression was not essential for immortalization , since neither T antigen nor G418 resistance was detected in the isolated cell lines and co-culture with non-producing 3T3 cells gave similar results . One cell line ( vEPT ) has been characterized in some detail with respect to morphological , biochemical , and ion transport properties . This line forms confluent monolayers with apical microvilli , tight junctions , and convolutions of the basolateral plasma membrane . Once confluent , monolayers maintain conductances of 25 to 32 mS/cm2 for several weeks in culture and possess phlorizin-sensitive short-circuit current ( Isc ) in glucose containing media , indicative of apical Na(+)-glucose co-transport. vEPT cells also retain receptor and signaling mechanisms for angiotensin II ( Ang II ) . Apical and basal Ang II and 5,6-epoxy-eicosatrienoic acid ( 5,6-EET ) modulate the Isc in a manner similar to primary cultures . The cell lines share with primary cultures expression of the cytokeratins K8 , K10/K11 , and K19 ( "nomenclature " [ 21] ) . They also retain several receptor and signal transduction mechanisms . For example , Ang II , arachidonate , bradykinin , 5,6-EET , parathyroid hormone ( residues 1 through 34 ) , and purine nucleotides increase cytosolic Ca2+ , PTH elevates cAMP levels , and Ang II enhances proximal tubule-specific arachidonic acid metabolism .
We have investigated the cellular requirements for IL-2 production by autocrine proliferating tumor cells from four patients with adult T cell leukemia ( ATL ) . Cultures of these ATL cells both produced endogenous IL-2 protein in the absence of added mitogen and proliferated at higher levels when exogenous recombinant IL-2 was added . Depletion of macrophages in the tumor cell cultures resulted in a sharp decline in tumor cell IL-2 production , while re-addition of macrophages reconstituted this response . Macrophage-derived factors including IL-6 and IL-1 also reconstituted IL-2 production in these macrophage depleted cultures . These results raise the possibility that macrophages may play a central role in HTLV-I mediated immortalization of T cells .
Previous studies have shown that the E7 gene of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) type 16 or 18 alone was sufficient for immortalization of human foreskin epithelial cells ( HFE ) and that the efficiency was increased in cooperation with the respective E6 gene , whereas the HPV6 E6 or E7 gene was not active in HFE . To detect weak immortalizing activities of the HPV6 genes , cells were infected with recombinant retroviruses containing HPV genes , alone and in homologous and heterologous combinations . The HPV6 genes , alone or together ( HPV6 E6 plus HPV6 E7 ) , were not able to immortalize cells . However the HPV6 E6 gene , in concert with HPV16 E7 , increased the frequency of immortalization threefold over that obtained with HPV16 E7 alone . Interestingly , 6 of 20 clones containing the HPV16 E6 gene and the HPV6 E7 gene were immortalized , whereas neither gene alone was sufficient . Thus , the HPV6 E6 and E7 genes have weak immortalizing activities which can be detected in cooperation with the more active transforming genes of HPV16 . Acute expression of the HPV6 and HPV16 E6 and E7 genes revealed that only HPV16 E7 was able to stimulate the proliferation of cells in organotypic culture , resulting in increased expression of the proliferative cell nuclear antigen and the formation of a disorganized epithelial layer . Additionally , combinations of genes that immortalized HFE cells ( HPV16 E6 plus HPV16 E7 , HPV16 E6 plus HPV6 E7 , and HPV6 E6 plus HPV16 E7 ) also stimulated proliferation .
The oncogenic potential of a human papillomavirus type 16 ( HPV16 ) variant cloned from normal human cervical keratinocytes has been tested in vitro using primary rodent epithelial cells and human cervical keratinocytes . The HPV16 variant was able to extend the lifespan of , but failed to immortalize , human keratinocytes . It could however cooperate with an activated ras oncogene to transform primary rodent cells . Radioimmunoprecipitation assays of the rodent cells showed that they expressed the E7 protein . DNA sequence analysis of the URR/E6/E7 and E5 regions of the HPV16 showed them to be fully functional , but a deletion in the viral E2 open reading frame was detected . This truncated E2 only weakly stimulated transcription of the viral regulatory region . Complementation assays using the HPV16 variant and a full-length E2 enabled the cloned variant to immortalize human cervical keratinocytes with wild-type efficiency . These results suggest that other viral gene products in addition to E6/E7 may play an important role in the in vitro immortalization of cervical keratinocytes in HPV16 and the development of cervical cancer .
The " high-risk " human papillomavirus types 16 ( HPV-16 ) and 18 ( HPV-18 ) have been etiologically implicated in the majority of human cervical carcinomas . In these cancers , the viral DNAs are often integrated into the host genome so that expression of the E1 and the E2 genes is lost , suggesting that disruption of these regulatory genes plays an important role in carcinogenic progression . Previous studies defining the viral genes affecting HPV-16 transformation functions have used the " prototype " viral genome , which was cloned from a human cervical carcinoma and later discovered to harbor a mutation in the E1 gene . In this study , we have corrected this mutation and have evaluated the effect of mutations of either the E1 or the E2 gene on the efficiency of HPV-16 immortalization of human keratinocytes . Mutation of either the E1 gene or the E2 gene in the background of a " wild-type " HPV-16 genome markedly increased immortalization capacity . Mutations were also generated in the E2-binding sites located upstream of the P97 promoter , which directs synthesis of the viral E6 and E7 transforming genes . E2 negatively regulates the P97 promoter through binding at adjacent sites . Surprisingly , the mutation of these sites only partially relieved the negative effect of E2 on viral immortalization , implicating additional mechanisms in the E2 repression of viral immortalization functions . Our results provide genetic evidence that the E1 and E2 gene products each can repress HPV-16 immortalization and support the hypothesis that a selective growth advantage is provided by integration of the viral genome in a manner that causes the loss of expression of either E1 or E2 .
Human papillomavirus type 16 ( HPV16 ) E6 and E7 are selectively retained and expressed in HPV16-associated human genital tumors . E6 is active in several cell culture assays , including transformation of NIH 3T3 cells , trans activation of the adenovirus E2 promoter , and cooperation with E7 to immortalize normal human keratinocytes . Biochemically , the HPV16 E6 protein has been shown to bind to tumor suppressor protein p53 in vitro and induce its degradation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate . To examine the relationship between the various biological activities of E6 and inactivation of p53 , we tested the abilities of dominant negative mutants of p53 to substitute functionally for E6 in the three cell culture assays . While wild-type p53 inhibited keratinocyte proliferation , both mouse and human mutant p53s , in conjunction with E7 , increased proliferation of the keratinocytes , resulting in generation of immortalized lines . However , in contrast to E6 , mutant p53 was unable to induce transformation or trans activate the adenovirus E2 promoter in NIH 3T3 cells . These results suggest that inactivation of wild-type p53 is necessary for HPV-induced immortalization of human keratinocytes and that different or additional activities are required for E6-dependent transformation and trans activation of NIH 3T3 cells .
Normal human lung fibroblast diploid cells , WI-38 , become senescent after a definite number of divisions . VA-13 is a line of immortalized cells established by transformation of WI-38 cells by SV40 virus . To determine whether SV40 large T ( SV40-T ) antigen is essential for this immortalization of WI-38 cells we introduced an antisense gene for T antigen into VA-13 . Two morphologically different types of antisense transformant ( VA-AS5-8 and VA-AS37-8 ) were obtained . In both antisense transformants the expression of T antigen was reduced by more than 70% as compared to that in the parent cells . The morphology of the antisense transformants indicated a partial conversion to the senescent phenotype of WI-38 . The relative number of cells in the S phase of the antisense transformants was decreased as compared to that in cultures of VA-13 and about 50% of cells were at G1/0 . The doubling time of the transformants was prolonged to close to the doubling time of WI-38 . The level of expression of retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) complexed with SV40-T antigen of the antisense transformants was significantly decreased although the level of total pRB was much higher than that in VA-13 . The pRB was present exclusively in the underphosphorylated form . Thus , the decreased level of formation of the complex between SV40-T and pRB or the underphosphorylation of pRB may explain the suppression of growth of antisense transformants . Together , these results show that an antisense gene for SV40-T antigen can efficiently block the cell proliferation and the cell immortalization of VA-13 cells .
Three normal human diploid cell strains were transfected with an activated Ha-ras oncogene ( EJ ras ) or SV40 T-antigen . Multiple clones were examined for morphological alterations , growth requirements , ability to grow under anchorage independent conditions , immortality and tumorigenicity in nude mice . Clones expressing SV40 T-antigen alone or in combination with ras protein p21 were significantly radioresistant as compared with their parent cells or clones transfected with the neo gene only . This radioresistant phenotype persisted in post-crisis , immortalized cell lines . Cells transfected with EJ ras alone showed no morphological alterations nor significant changes in radiosensitivity . Cell clones expressing ras and/or SV40 T-antigen showed a reduced requirement for serum supplements , an increase in aneuploidy and chromosomal aberrations , and enhanced growth in soft agar as an early cellular response to SV40 T-antigen expression . The sequential order of transfection with SV40 T-antigen and ras influenced radio-sensitivity but not the induction of morphological changes . These data suggest that expression of the SV40 T-antigen but not activated Ha-ras plays an important role in the radiosensitivity of human diploid cells . The radioresistant phenotype in SV40 T transfected cells was not related to the enhanced level of genetic instability seen in pre-crisis and newly immortalized cells , nor to the process of immortalization itself .
Human diploid fibroblasts have a limited life span in vitro , and spontaneous immortalization is an extremely rare event . We have used transformation of human diploid fibroblasts by an origin-defective simian virus 40 genome to develop series of genetically matched immortal cell lines to analyze immortalization . Comparison of a preimmortal transformant ( SVtsA/HF-A ) with its uncloned and cloned immortalized derivatives ( AR5 and HAL ) has failed to reveal any major alteration involving the simian virus 40 genome . Karyotypic analysis , however , demonstrated that all of the immortal cell lines in this series have alterations of chromosome 6 involving loss of the portion distal to 6q21 . The karyotypic analysis was corroborated by DNA analyses . Southern analysis demonstrated that only one copy of three proto-oncogene loci ( ros1 , c-myb , and mas1 ) on 6q was retained in immortal cells . Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the microsatellite polymorphism at 6q22 ( D6S87 ) showed loss of heterozygosity . In addition , elevated expression of c-myb ( 6q22-23 ) was observed . We hypothesize that the region at and/or distal to 6q21 plays a role in immortalization , consistent with the presence of a growth suppressor gene .
Transforming growth factor-Beta ( TGF-beta ) is a potent growth inhibitor for several cell types including epithelial cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells . Using a human promonocytic leukemia cell line , THP-1 , we have shown that TGF-beta inhibits their proliferation and promotes differentiation into cells exhibiting macrophage-like properties . Therefore , a key question is whether TGF-beta influences the expression of genes associated with proliferation and/or growth inhibition . TGF-beta treatment of THP-1 cells results in downregulation of expression of c-myc . We also observe that TGF-beta 1-treated cells express reduced levels of the cell cycle regulated histone , H2B , but express elevated levels of an RNA splicing variant of this histone that has been observed to be upregulated in growth inhibited and terminally differentiated cells . In addition , a nuclear protein associated with senescence and withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle , statin , is also expressed by THP-1 cells in response to TGF-beta 1 treatment . These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 is capable of inducing expression of specific nuclear proteins associated with differentiation and/or cessation of proliferation that may result in changes in nuclear organization and altered gene expression . Such changes in nuclear organization may be incompatible with continued proliferation of the cells .
The hypothesis that rodent cells can be immortalized by the direct induction of a single mutation-like event was tested by initiating cultures of benzo(a)pyrene treated Syrian hamster embryo cells with low inocula and expanding these few cells maximally until senescence prevented further culturing or immortalization took place . According to the mutation hypothesis immortalization is hardly to be expected under these conditions . However , immortalization was frequently observed . Therefore the induction of immortalization appears indirect . The progeny of benzo(a)pyrene treated cells immortalized with a rate of 3.9 x 10(-8)/cell/generation , which is 64 times higher than the spontaneous rate . The results are in line with the probabilistic theory developed in 1980 by both Fernandez et al . ( Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA , 77 : 7272-7276 , 1980 ) and Kennedy et al . ( Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA , 77 : 7262-7266 , 1980 ) , which states that treatment of cells with a carcinogen can result in a so-called activated state of the treated cells which is transmitted to the progeny and which results in an enhanced rate of transforming events .
Cellular senescence is the genetically programmed cessation of cellular proliferation . We have recently mapped a putative senescence gene(s) on the X chromosome of Chinese hamster embryo ( CHE ) cells . In the present study , we have utilized microcell-mediated chromosome transfer ( microcell fusion ) to test whether : ( i ) the human X chromosome exhibits similar genetic potential to induce senescence and ( ii ) the deletion or inactivation of the X-linked senescence gene(s) in CHE cells is associated with nickel-induced immortalization . A normal CHE or human X chromosome was first introduced into mouse-cell hybrids , then transferred by microcell fusion into a nickel-transformed , immortal male CHE cell line ( Ni-2/TGR ) with an X deletion ( Xq1 ) . Microcell fusion of the normal CHE X chromosome into tumorigenic Ni-2/TGR cells yielded senescence of all X recipient clones . The normal human X chromosome induced dominant senescence of tumorigenic Ni-2/TGR cells in only 17% of the resulting microcell hybrids ( 14/81 ) . Karyotypic analyses of 13 non-senescing human X chromosome-derived microcell hybrid clones revealed that none of these clones retained the complete X. A normal CHE X chromosome induced senescence of 75% of hybrids obtained with another immortal and tumorigenic nickel-transformed male CHE cell line ( Ni-6/TGR ) , which exhibited no visible deletion of the X chromosome , while the normal human X chromosome , only induced senescence in 19% of these hybrids . Transfer of the normal CHE or human X chromosome into spontaneously transformed and tumorigenic cell lines , CHO/TGR or V79/TGR , had little or no effect on their growth . These data suggest that both human and CHE cells possess similar X-linked genetic activities that regulate the process of cellular senescence , and that in Chinese hamster cells nickel-induced immortalization but not that of CHO or V79 cells is associated with inactivation of an X-linked senescence gene .
Clones of mortal chicken fibroblasts and erythroblasts transformed by temperature-sensitive v-src and v-erb B oncoproteins have been developed into immortal cell lines that retain the conditional transformed phenotype . The expressions of two tumor suppressor genes , the retinoblastoma ( Rb ) gene and the p53 gene , were investigated during senescence , crisis , and cell line establishment . In temperature-sensitive ( ts)-v-erb B erythroblasts and ts-v-src fibroblasts ( as well as in v-myc macrophages ) , loss of p53 mRNA or expression of a mutated p53 gene invariably occurred in the early phase of immortalization . In contrast , expression of the Rb gene was unchanged at all stages of immortalization . Inactivation of the original temperature-sensitive oncogene led to loss of the transformed phenotype in fibroblasts and to differentiation in erythroblasts , even in lines that were immortal and lacked p53 . The results demonstrate that the process of immortalization is distinct from cell transformation , probably requiring different mutational events .
Loss of telomeric DNA during cell proliferation may play a role in ageing and cancer . Since telomeres permit complete replication of eukaryotic chromosomes and protect their ends from recombination , we have measured telomere length , telomerase activity and chromosome rearrangements in human cells before and after transformation with SV40 or Ad5 . In all mortal populations , telomeres shortened by approximately 65 bp/generation during the lifespan of the cultures . When transformed cells reached crisis , the length of the telomeric TTAGGG repeats was only approximately 1.5 kbp and many dicentric chromosomes were observed . In immortal cells , telomere length and frequency of dicentric chromosomes stabilized after crisis . Telomerase activity was not detectable in control or extended lifespan populations but was present in immortal populations . These results suggest that chromosomes with short ( TTAGGG)n tracts are recombinogenic , critically shortened telomeres may be incompatible with cell proliferation and stabilization of telomere length by telomerase may be required for immortalization .
The effects of human interferon ( IFN)-alpha , -beta , and -gamma on the immortalization of human and rabbit lymphocytes by human T-lymphotropic virus type-I ( HTLV-I ) have been investigated . The immortalization of human peripheral-blood lymphocytes co-cultured with lethally X-ray-irradiated HTLV-I-producer cells , MT-2 , was blocked in the presence of more than 40 u/ml human recombinant IFN-alpha or more than 200 u/ml human natural type IFN-beta . However , rhIFN-gamma did not block immortalization by HTLV-I even at higher doses . On the other hand , the presence of high doses of hIFN-alpha , -beta , or -gamma did not exhibit any biological effect on the immortalization of rabbit peripheral-blood lymphocytes co-cultured with lethally X-ray-irradiated MT-2 cells . Integration of the full length of HTLV-I genome was detected in every transformant by Southern blot analysis . All cell lines established were CD4+/CD8 divided by T-lymphocytes , except for one cell line of CD4+/CD8+ . Morphologically intact HTLV-I production was observed by electron microscopy in these cells . Our results indicate that HTLV-I released under the strongly suppressed condition in the presence of IFNs remains active and able to immortalize T lymphocytes . It is also suggested that immortalization of human T lymphocytes by HTLV-I can be inhibited by the antiviral state induced by the treatment with low doses of hIFN-alpha and -beta , whereas immortalization of rabbit T lymphocytes is not inhibited because of the species specificity of hIFNs .
Primary fibroblasts respond to activated H-RAS(V12) by undergoing premature arrest , which resembles replicative senescence . This irreversible ' fail-safe mechanism ' requires p19(ARF) , p53 and the Retinoblastoma ( Rb ) family : upon their disruption , RAS(V12)-expressing cells fail to undergo senescence and continue to proliferate . Similarly , co-expression of oncogenes such as c-MYC or E1A rescues RAS(V12)-induced senescence . To identify novel genes that allow escape from RAS(V12)-induced senescence , we designed an unbiased , retroviral complementary DNA library screen . We report on the identification of DRIL1 , the human orthologue of the mouse Bright and Drosophila dead ringer transcriptional regulators . DRIL1 renders primary murine fibroblasts unresponsive to RAS(V12)-induced anti-proliferative signalling by p19(ARF)/p53/p21(CIP1) , as well as by p16(INK4a) . In this way , DRIL1 not only rescues RAS(V12)-induced senescence but also causes these fibroblasts to become highly oncogenic . Furthermore , DRIL1 immortalizes mouse fibroblasts , in the presence of high levels of p16(INK4a) . Immortalization by DRIL1 , whose product binds the pRB-controlled transcription factor E2F1 ( ref. 8 ) , is correlated with induction of E2F1 activity . Correspondingly , DRIL1 induces the E2F1 target Cyclin E1 , overexpression of which is sufficient to trigger escape from senescence . Thus , DRIL1 disrupts cellular protection against RAS(V12)-induced proliferation downstream of the p19(ARF)/p53 pathway .
p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in many human malignancies , including gastric cancer . It remains unclear why patients with germ-line p53 mutations ( i.e. , Li-Fraumeni syndrome ) are not at increased risk for gastric adenocarcinoma , despite the fact that they show a high rate of many other tumors . Furthermore , the precise relationship between germ-line p53 mutations and the response to chronic bacterial infections ( such as Helicobacter spp. ) has not been investigated . To assess the role of germ-line p53 deletions in modulating the progression to gastric cancer , p53(+/-) and wild-type ( WT ) C57BL/6 mice were infected with H. felis . The gastric pathology and immune response in these two groups of mice were analyzed for up to 15 months postinfection . The gastric fundus and antrum were evaluated independently using a 0-4 scale to score inflammation , parietal and chief cell loss , mucus metaplasia , and helicobacter colonization . Nonparametric statistical analysis was performed to determine the effects of p53(+/-) , infection status , and postinoculation ( p.i. ) time on inflammation , preneoplastic changes , invasive lesions , and helicobacter colonization. mRNA expression for gammaIFN , interleukin ( IL)-1 , IL-10 , and IL-4 was quantified by PCR . Sera were also evaluated for H. felis antibody by ELISA . Antral inflammation increased significantly with time in infected mice . There was a significant , protective effect on the development of preneoplastic fundic lesions and invasive carcinoma attributable to the deletion of one p53 allele ( P < 0.05 ) . Submucosal invasive foci were observed in 9 of 11 WT-infected mice ranging from 13 to 15 months p.i. ; invasion of adjacent submucosal blood vessels by glandular epithelia also was present in 5 of these mice . None of these lesions were observed in 33 p53(+/-) mice , infected or not , at any time p.i. p53(+/-) mice had significantly higher helicobacter colonization consistent with a Th2 host response . In sera from WT mice , IgG2a , considered a proinflammatory Th1 response , continued to rise throughout the 15-month study ( P < 0.004 ) . In contrast , IgG2a levels of the p53(+/-) mice were 50-60% lower than those of the WT mice at each time point ( P range , <0.012 to 0.002 ) and did not progress in magnitude between 12 and 15 months of chronic H. felis infection ( P = 0.167). mRNA levels for gammaIFN and IL-1 were significantly up-regulated in WT mice infected with H. felis ( P < 0.05 ) but were slightly elevated or were at background levels in p53(+/-) mice . IL-10 and IL-4 mRNA expression was not significantly different from control samples . Our results support the hypothesis that germ-line deletion of one p53 allele results in a down-regulated Th1 response to gastric helicobacter infection , possibly because of T-cell senescence , which may indirectly protect against the development of gastric cancer and other epithelial-derived neoplasms associated with chronic inflammation .
P53 activity plays a key role in mammalian cells when they undergo replicative senescence at their Hayflick limit . To determine whether p63 proteins , members of the family of p53-related genes , are also involved in this process , we examined their expression in serially passaged rat embryo fibroblasts . Upon senescence , two truncated DeltaNp63 proteins decreased in abundance whereas two TAp63 isoforms accumulated. 2-D gel analysis showed that the DeltaNp63 proteins underwent post-translational modifications in both proliferating and senescent cells . Direct binding of DeltaNp63 proteins to a p53 consensus motif was greater in proliferating cells than senescent cells . In contrast p63alpha isoforms bound to DNA in a p53 dependent manner and this was higher in senescent cells than proliferating cells . An interaction of p63alpha proteins with SV40 large tumour antigen was also detected and ectopic expression of DeltaNp63alpha can extend the lifespan of rat embryo fibroblasts . Taken together the results indicate that p63 proteins may play a role in replicative senescence either by competition for p53 DNA binding sites or by direct interaction with p53 protein bound to DNA .
Mesotheliomas are malignant tumors of the pleural and peritoneal membranes which are often associated with asbestos exposure and with Simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) infection . Telomerase activity is repressed in somatic cells and tissues but is activated in immortal and malignant cells . We evaluated telomerase activity in seven primary malignant mesothelioma biopsies and matched lung specimens and 20 mesothelioma cell lines and eight corresponding primary tumor cultures . All the tumor biopsies , and nearly all primary cell mesothelioma cultures and cell lines were telomerase positive . The findings in cell lines paralleled those observed in primary cultures in cases where paired samples were available . Next , we found that SV40 , a DNA tumor virus present in approximately 50% of mesothelioma biopsies in the USA , induced telomerase activity in primary human mesothelial cells , but not in primary fibroblasts . Telomerase activity became detectable as early as 72 h following wild-type ( strain 776 ) SV40 infection , and a clear DNA ladder was detectable 1 week after infection . The amount of telomerase activity increased during passage in cell culture and appeared to parallel increases in the cellular amounts of the SV40 large T-antigen . Thus , SV40 infection leads to telomerase activity before the infected mesothelial cells become transformed and immortalized . SV40 infection of human fibroblasts did not cause detectable telomerase activity . We also determined that the SV40 small t-antigen ( tag ) plays an important role in inducing telomerase activity because this activity was undetectable or minimal in mesothelial cells infected and/or transformed by SV40 tag mutants . Asbestos alone did not induce telomerase activity , and asbestos did not influence telomerase activity in mesothelial cells infected with SV40 . Induction of telomerase activity by SV40 may be related to the very high rate of mesothelial cell immortalization that is characteristically associated with SV40 infection of mesothelial cells .
Treatment of cells with the anti-cancer drug camptothecin ( CPT ) induces topoisomerase I ( Top1)-mediated DNA damage , which in turn affects cell proliferation and survival . In this report , we demonstrate that treatment of the wild-type HCT116 ( wt HCT116 ) human colon cancer cell line and the isogenic p53(-/-) HCT116 and p21(-/-) HCT116 cell lines with a high concentration ( 250 nm ) of CPT resulted in apoptosis , indicating that apoptosis occurred by a p53- and p21-independent mechanism . In contrast , treatment with a low concentration ( 20 nm ) of CPT induced cell cycle arrest and senescence of the wt HCT116 cells , but apoptosis of the p53(-/-) HCT116 and p21(-/-) HCT116 cells . Further investigations indicated that p53-dependent expression of p21 blocked apoptosis of wt HCT116 cells treated with 20 nm , but not 250 nm CPT . Interestingly , blocking of the apoptotic pathway , by Z-VAD-FMK , in p21(-/-) HCT116 cells following treatment with 20 nm CPT did not permit the cells to develop properties of senescence . These observations demonstrated that p21 was required for senescence development of HCT116 cells following treatment with low concentrations of CPT .
Often the use of cytotoxic drugs in cancer therapy results in stable disease rather than regression of the tumor , and this is typically seen as a failure of treatment . We now show that DNA damage is able to induce senescence in tumor cells expressing wild-type p53 . We also show that cytotoxics are capable of inducing senescence in tumor tissue in vivo . Our results suggest that p53 and p21 play a central role in the onset of senescence , whereas p16(INK4a) function may be involved in maintaining senescence . Thus , like apoptosis , senescence appears to be a p53-induced cellular response to DNA damage and an important factor in determining treatment outcome .
Senescence limits the proliferative capacity of primary cells in culture . We describe here a genetic screen to identify genes that allow bypass of this checkpoint . Using retroviral cDNA expression libraries , we identify BCL6 as a potent inhibitor of senescence . BCL6 is frequently activated in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma , but its mechanism of action has remained unclear . BCL6 efficiently immortalizes primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and cooperates with RAS in oncogenic transformation . BCL6 overrides the senescence response downstream of p53 through a process that requires induction of cyclin D1 expression , as cyclin D1 knockout fibroblasts are specifically resistant to BCL6 immortalization . We show that BCL6 expression also dramatically extends the replicative lifespan of primary human B cells in culture and induces cyclin D1 expression , indicating that BCL6 has a similar activity in lymphoid cells . Our results suggest that BCL6 contributes to oncogenesis by rendering cells unresponsive to antiproliferative signals from the p19(ARF)-p53 pathway .
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that functions to maintain telomeres , the terminal DNA that protects chromosomal integrity , regulating cellular replicative life span . Telomerase is not expressed in most normal human somatic cells but is active in stabilizing telomeres of certain self-renewing cell populations and most malignant cells , making the enzyme an appealing target for anticancer therapy . We describe here a novel cross-species approach to telomerase inhibition . Ectopic expression of the human telomerase catalytic reverse transcriptase component in murine cells inhibited endogenous murine telomerase activity . Using this approach , telomerase inhibition in immortal murine fibroblasts resulted in critical telomere shortening , leading to slowed proliferation , abnormal morphology , altered cell cycle , and telomere dysfunction with cytogenetic instability , followed by apoptotic cell death . Subpopulations of two telomerase-inhibited clones escaped widespread apoptosis , showing proliferative recovery in culture despite persistently inhibited telomerase activity with progressive telomere shortening and dysfunction . This study , by targeting immortal murine cells for telomerase inhibition , demonstrates the importance of telomerase to murine cell immortalization and telomere maintenance . Moreover , the murine model used here should prove useful in further evaluating telomerase inhibition as an anticancer therapy .
UVB from solar radiation is both an initiating and promoting agent for skin cancer . We have found that primary human keratinocytes undergo an apoptotic response to UVB . To determine whether these responses are altered during the course of immortalization , we examined markers of apoptosis in primary human foreskin keratinocytes ( HFK ) transduced with either a retroviral vector expressing the E6 and E7 genes of HPV-16 or with empty vector alone ( LXSN-HFK ) . Whereas LXSN-HFK as well as early passage keratinocytes expressing HPV-16 E6 and E7 ( p7 E6/7-HFK ) were both moderately responsive to UVB irradiation , late passage-immortalized keratinocytes ( p27 E6/7-HFK ) were exquisitely sensitive to UVB-induced apoptosis . After exposure to UVB , enhanced annexin V-positivity and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation were observed in p27 E6/7-HFK compared with either LXSN- or p7 E6/7-HFK . Caspase-3 fluorometric activity assays as well as immunoblot analysis with antibodies to caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase revealed elevated caspase-3 activity and processing at lower UVB doses in p27 E6/7-HFK compared with LXSN- or p7 E6/7-HFK . In addition , the caspase inhibitor DEVD-CHO reduced the apoptotic response and increased survival of all three HFK types . Immunoblot analysis revealed that caspase-8 was activated in all three cell types , but caspase-9 was only activated in p27 E6/7-HFK . Cell cycle analysis further showed that only p27 E6/7-HFK exhibit G(2)/M accumulation that is enhanced by UVB treatment . This accumulation was associated with a rapid down-regulation of Bcl-2 in these cells . The immortalization process subsequent to the expression of HPV E6 and E7 may therefore determine UVB sensitivity by switching the mode of apoptosis from a caspase-8 to a Bcl-2-caspase-9-mediated pathway of apoptosis .
The in vitro immortalization of primary human mammary epithelial ( HME ) cells solely by the exogenous introduction of the catalytic subunit of human telomerase ( hTERT ) has been achieved . Early passage hTERT-transfected HME ( T-HME ) cells continuously decreased the length and density of telomeres even in the presence of telomerase activity , with a significant number of cells staining positive for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase ( SA-beta-gal ) . Subsequently , with the increase in cell passages , the copy number of the exogenously transfected hTERT gene and the percentage of SA-beta-gal positive cells were found to decrease . Eventually , a single copy of the exogenous hTERT gene was observed in the relatively later passage T-HME cells in which telomere length was elongated and stabilized without obvious activation of endogenous hTERT and c-Myc expression . In T-HME cells , the expression of two p53 regulated genes p21(WAF) and HDM2 increased ( as in primary senescent HME cells ) , and was found to be further elevated as the function of p53 was activated by treatment with DNA-damaging agents. p16(INK4a) was shown to be significantly higher in the primary senescent HME and the early passage T-HME cells when compared with the primary presenescent HME cells , with a dramatic repression of p16(INK4a) observed in the later passage T-HME cells . In addition , the expression of E2F1 and its transcription factor activity were found to be significantly higher in the later passage T-HME cells when compared with the earlier passage T-HME cells . Together , our results indicate that in vitro immortalization in HME cells may require the activation of the function of telomerase and other genetic alterations such as the spontaneous loss of p16(INK4a) expression .
The t(10;11)(p12;q23) chromosomal translocation in human acute myeloid leukemia results in the fusion of the MLL and AF10 genes . The latter codes for a novel leucine zipper protein , one of many MLL fusion partners of unknown function . In this report , we demonstrate that retroviral-mediated transduction of an MLL-AF10 complementary DNA into primary murine myeloid progenitors enhanced their clonogenic potential in serial replating assays and led to their efficient immortalization at a primitive stage of myeloid differentiation . Furthermore , MLL-AF10-transduced cells rapidly induced acute myeloid leukemia in syngeneic or severe combined immunodeficiency recipient mice . Structure/function analysis showed that a highly conserved 82-amino acid portion of AF10 , comprising 2 adjacent alpha-helical domains , was sufficient for immortalizing activity when fused to MLL . Neither helical domain alone mediated immortalization , and deletion of the 29-amino acid leucine zipper within this region completely abrogated transforming activity . Similarly , the minimal oncogenic domain of AF10 exhibited transcriptional activation properties when fused to the MLL or GAL4 DNA-binding domains , while neither helical domain alone did . However , transcriptional activation per se was not sufficient because a second activation domain of AF10 was neither required nor competent for transformation . The requirement for alpha-helical transcriptional effector domains is similar to the oncogenic contributions of unrelated MLL partners ENL and ELL , suggesting a general mechanism of myeloid leukemogenesis by a subset of MLL fusion proteins , possibly through specific recruitment of the transcriptional machinery .
The yeast Sir2 protein mediates chromatin silencing through an intrinsic NAD-dependent histone deacetylase activity . Sir2 is a conserved protein and was recently shown to regulate lifespan extension both in budding yeast and worms . Here , we show that SIRT1 , the human Sir2 homolog , is recruited to the promyelocytic leukemia protein ( PML ) nuclear bodies of mammalian cells upon overexpression of either PML or oncogenic Ras ( Ha-rasV12 ) . SIRT1 binds and deacetylates p53 , a component of PML nuclear bodies , and it can repress p53-mediated transactivation . Moreover , we show that SIRT1 and p53 co-localize in nuclear bodies upon PML upregulation . When overexpressed in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts ( MEFs ) , SIRT1 antagonizes PML-induced acetylation of p53 and rescues PML-mediated premature cellular senescence . Taken together , our data establish the SIRT1 deacetylase as a novel negative regulator of p53 function capable of modulating cellular senescence .
In vitro model systems for studying uterine leiomyomas are limited in that human-derived leiomyoma cells grow poorly in culture compared with normal myometrial cells and begin to senesce early , at approximately passage 10 in our studies . To our knowledge , a good in vitro human-derived cell culturing system for leiomyomas does not exist . In an attempt to fill this void , we have immortalized a uterine leiomyoma cell line by inducing telomerase activity , which allows cells to bypass their normal programmed senescence . Telomerase activity was induced by infecting the target ( uterine leiomyoma and normal myometrial ) cells with a retroviral vector containing hTERT , the gene for the catalytic subunit of telomerase . Subsequent analysis by RT-PCR and the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay confirmed expression of the inserted gene and induction of telomerase activity in leiomyoma and myometrial cells . Analysis of cells for estrogen receptor-alpha and progesterone receptor proteins by Western blotting showed no change in expression of these proteins between the immortalized and parental leiomyoma and myometrial cells . Both immortalized and parental myometrial and leiomyoma cells expressed the smooth muscle-specific cytoskeletal protein alpha-actin and were negative for mutant p53 protein as evidenced by immunocytochemical staining . The immortalized leiomyoma and myometrial cells showed no anchorage-independent growth , with the exception of a small subpopulation of immortalized leiomyoma cells at a higher passage that did form two to three small colonies ( per 50,000 cells ) in soft agar . None of the immortalized cells were tumorigenic in nude mice . In conclusion , our data show the successful insertion of the hTERT gene into leiomyoma and myometrial cells and the immortalization of these cell lines without phenotypic alteration from the parental cell types ( up to 200 population doublings ) . These cells should help to advance research in understanding the molecular pathways involved in the conversion of a normal myometrial cell to a leiomyoma cell and the mechanisms responsible for the growth of uterine leiomyomas . Answers to these questions will undoubtedly lead to the development of more effective treatment and intervention regimens for clinical cases of uterine leiomyoma .
The association between acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) and the aberrant expression of Hoxa9 is evidenced by ( 1 ) proviral activation of Hoxa9 and Meis1 in BXH-2 murine AML , ( 2 ) formation of the chimeric Nup98-HoxA9 transactivator protein as a consequence of the t(7;11) translocation in human AML , and ( 3 ) the strong expression of HoxA9 and Meis1 in human AML . In mouse models , enforced retroviral expression of Hoxa9 alone in marrow is not sufficient to cause rapid AML , while co-expression of Meis1 and Hoxa9 induces rapid AML . In contrast , retroviral expression of Nup98-HoxA9 is sufficient to cause rapid AML in the absence of enforced Meis1 expression . Previously , we demonstrated that Hoxa9 could block the differentiation of murine marrow progenitors cultured in granulocyte-macrophage colony-simulating factor ( GM-CSF ) . These progenitors lacked Meis1 expression , could not proliferate in stem cell factor ( SCF ) , but could differentiate into neutrophils when switched into granulocyte colony-simulating factor ( G-CSF ) . Ectopic expression of Meis1 in these Hoxa9 cells suppressed their G-CSF-induced differentiation , permitted proliferation in SCF , and therein offered a potential explanation of cooperative function . Because Meis1 binds N-terminal Hoxa9 sequences that are replaced by Nup98 , we hypothesized that Nup98-HoxA9 might consolidate the biochemical functions of both Hoxa9 and Meis1 on target gene promoters and might evoke their same lymphokine-responsive profile in immortalized progenitors . Here we report that Nup98-HoxA9 , indeed mimicks Hoxa9 plus Meis1 coexpression - it immortalizes myeloid progenitors , prevents differentiation in response to GM-CSF , IL-3 , G-CSF , and permits proliferation in SCF . Unexpectedly , however , Nup98-Hoxa9 also enforced strong transcription of the cellular Hoxa9 , Hoxa7 and Meis1 genes at levels similar to those found in mouse AML's generated by proviral activation of Hoxa9 and Meis1 . Using Hoxa9(-/-) marrow , we demonstrate that expression of Hoxa9 is not required for myeloid immortalization by Nup98-HoxA9 . Rapid leukaemogenesis by Nup98-HoxA9 may therefore result from both the intrinsic functions of Nup98-HoxA9 , as well as of those of coexpressed HOX and MEIS1 genes .
Direct experimental evidence implicates telomere erosion as a primary cause of cellular senescence . Using a well characterized model system for breast cancer , we define here the molecular and cellular consequences of adriamycin treatment in breast tumor cells . Cells acutely exposed to adriamycin exhibited an increase in p53 activity , a decline in telomerase activity , and a dramatic increase in beta-galactosidase , a marker of senescence . Inactivation of wild-type p53 resulted in a transition of the cellular response to adriamycin treatment from replicative senescence to delayed apoptosis , demonstrating that p53 plays an integral role in the fate of breast tumor cells treated with DNA-damaging agents . Stable introduction of hTERT , the catalytic protein component of telomerase , into MCF-7 cells caused an increase in telomerase activity and telomere length . Treatment of MCF-7-hTERT cells with adriamycin produced an identical senescence response as controls without signs of telomere shortening , indicating that the senescence after treatment is telomere length-independent . However , we found that exposure to adriamycin resulted in an overrepresentation of cytogenetic changes involving telomeres , showing an altered telomere state induced by adriamycin is probably a causal factor leading to the senescence phenotype . To our knowledge , these data are the first to demonstrate that the mechanism of adriamycin-induced senescence is dependent on both functional p53 and telomere dysfunction rather than overall shortening .
The metabolic detoxification capacity may critically regulate the susceptibility of human tissues to cancer development . We used standardized and quantitative , reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( StaRT-PCR ) and microarray chip techniques to analyze transcript levels of multiple detoxification enzymes in cultured normal human oral keratinocytes ( NOK ) and the Siman virus 40 T antigen-immortalized oral keratinocyte line SVpgC2a , viewing the latter as a model of a benign tumor state . With good agreement between the 2 methodologies , NOK and SVpgC2a were found to express transcripts for cytochrome P450 enzymes ( CYPs ) , factors related to CYP induction and enzymes involved in conjugation reactions or detoxification of reactive oxygen . The cell types expressed similar levels of CYP 2B6/7 , CYP 2E1 , P450 oxidoreductase , the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator , sulfotransferase 1A1 , sulfotransferase 1A3 , epoxide hydrolase , glutathione S-transferase M3 , glutathione S-transferase pi and catalase , superoxide dismutase 1 , glutathione peroxidase 1 and glutathione peroxidase 3 . In contrast , SVpgC2a exhibited comparatively higher levels of CYP1A1 , 1B1 , aryl hydrocarbon receptor , glutathione S-transferase M1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , glutathione S-transferase theta 1 and superoxide dismutase 2 and comparatively lower levels of UDP glycosyltransferase 2 and microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 . Some transcripts , e.g. , CYP 2A6/7 , were not detected by either standard , non quantitative RT-PCR or the above methods , whereas others were barely quantifiable by StaRT-PCR , i.e. , were present at 1-10 molecules/10(6) molecules of actin . Overall , the expression analysis demonstrated presence of mRNA for multiple enzymes involved in foreign compound metabolism and detoxification pathways , including several enzymes not previously reported for oral epithelium . Generally , the comparison of NOK from 2 individuals indicated relatively similar transcript levels of these enzymes . In contrast , differences between NOK and SVpgC2a , e.g. , for CYP1B1 , may reflect alteration caused by immortalization and aid identification of early stage tumor markers in oral epithelium .
The HOX11 gene encodes a homeodomain transcription factor that is essential for spleen development during embryogenesis . HOX11 is also leukaemogenic , both through its clinical association with childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia , and its ability to immortalize other haematopoietic cell lineages experimentally . To examine the pathological role of HOX11 in tumorigenesis , we constitutively expressed HOX11 cDNA in J2E murine erythroleukaemic cells , which are capable of terminal differentiation . Enforced HOX11 expression was found to induce a profound alteration in J2E cellular morphology and differentiation status . Our analyses revealed that HOX11 produced clones with a preponderance of less differentiated cells that were highly adherent to plastic . Morphologically , the cells overexpressing HOX11 were larger and had decreased globin levels , as well as a reduction in haemoglobin synthesis in response to erythropoietin ( EPO ) . Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed the immature erythroid phenotype imposed by HOX11 , with clones transfected with HOX11 demonstrating expression of the c-Kit stem cell marker , while retaining EPO receptor expression . Taken together , these results show that HOX11 alters erythroid differentiation , favouring a less mature progenitor-like stage . This supports the notion that disrupted haematopoietic cell differentiation is responsible for pre-leukaemic immortalization by the HOX11 oncoprotein .
Cellular senescence , initially observed during subculturing of normal diploid fibroblasts , can also be induced by chronic exposure to cellular stress , such as UV light , oxidative stress , or DNA damaging agents . Here we demonstrate that stable expression of an activated form of MKK6 ( MKK6EE ) , a direct activator of the stress-induced p38(HOG) mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway , is sufficient for inducing features of senescence including a flattened , vacuolated , and irregular morphology , staining for acidic beta-galactosidase , and accumulation of age-associated pigments . Consistent with the senescent phenotype , p38(HOG) activation induces a G(1) cell cycle arrest , which is permanent and irreversible after 4 days . MKK6EE also induces biochemical features of senescence in a p38-dependent manner , including enhanced expression of p21(CIP) , a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor . Microarray analysis of MKK6EE cells showed a pattern of gene expression noted previously in Werner Syndrome and senescent fibroblasts . These results define p38(HOG) as an intracellular pathway that activates a senescence checkpoint in tumor cells and may play a role in Ras- or stress-induced senescence .
A hallmark of cancer cells is the ability to proliferate indefinitely . This acquisition of an immortal lifespan usually requires the activation of telomerase , the enzyme that elongates telomeres . Human telomerase is minimally composed of the reverse transcriptase subunit hTERT , and the RNA subunit hTR . While hTR is ubiquitously expressed in human cells , the hTERT subunit is generally transcriptionally repressed in most normal somatic cells , but is illegitimately activated to restore telomerase activity in cancer cells . Indeed , in the thousands of different human tumours assayed , 85% were scored positive for telomerase activity . However , the levels of telomerase activity detected in tumour samples can vary substantially and even some normal somatic cells have been found to have low levels of enzyme activity . As the functional significance of low levels of telomerase activity is unclear , we investigated whether there is a minimum level of telomerase activity required for tumourigenesis . Using mutants of hTERT that induce varying levels of telomerase activity , we show that there does indeed exist a threshold of activity required for the processes of immortalization , transformation and tumourigenesis . Thus , low levels of activity detected in certain somatic cells would not be expected to contribute to tumourigenesis , nor does the mere detection of telomerase in cancer cells necessarily signify an immortal lifespan .
Using standard culture conditions , primary human mammary epithelial cells ( HMECs ) undergo a premature , transient growth arrest termed M0 ( mortality stage 0 ) after 10-15 population doublings in vitro . It has been reported that emergence from this growth arrest by the abrogation of p16(INK4a) , a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , and expression of the catalytic component of human telomerase ( hTERT ) are necessary for HMEC immortalization . Here we show that primary HMECs , grown on feeder layers , do not undergo this growth arrest and can be immortalized without abrogating p16 . These findings support the concept that the so-called M0 stage represents a cell culture stress-induced growth arrest and that hTERT is sufficient to immortalize HMECs when cultured under adequate conditions .
A large number of human cancers display alterations in the Ink4a/cyclin D/Cdk4 genetic pathway , suggesting that activation of Cdk4 plays an important role in oncogenesis . Here we report that Cdk4-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts are resistant to transformation in response to Ras activation with dominant-negative ( DN ) p53 expression or in the Ink4a/Arf-null background , judged by foci formation , anchorage-independent growth , and tumorigenesis in athymic mice . Cdk4-null fibroblasts proliferate at normal rates during early passages . Whereas Cdk4(+/+)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) cells are immortal in culture , Cdk4(-/-)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) cells undergo senescence during continuous culture , as do wild-type cells . Activated Ras also induces premature senescence in Cdk4(-/-)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) cells and Cdk4(-/-) cells with DNp53 expression . Thus , Cdk4 deficiency causes senescence in a unique Arf/p53-independent manner , which accounts for the loss of transformation potential . Cdk4-null cells express high levels of p21(Cip1/Waf1) with increased protein stability . Suppression of p21(Cip1/Waf1) by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , as well as expression of HPV-E7 oncoprotein , restores immortalization and Ras-mediated transformation in Cdk4(-/-)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) cells and Cdk4(-/-) cells with DNp53 expression . Therefore , Cdk4 is essential for immortalization , and suppression of Cdk4 could be a prospective strategy to recruit cells with inactive Arf/p53 pathway to senescence .
AIM To investigate the progressive transformation of immortal cells of human fetal esophageal epithelium induced by human papillomavirus , and to examine biological criteria of sequential passage of cells , including cellular phenotype , proliferative rate , telomerase , chromosome and tumorigenicity . METHODS The SHEE cell series consisted of immortalized embryonic esophageal epithelium which was in malignant transformation when cultivated over sixty passages without co-carcinogens . Cells of the 10th , 31st , 60th and 85th passages were present in progressive development after being transfected with HPV . Cells were cultivated in a culture flask and 24-hole cultural plates . Progressive changes of morphology , cell growth , contact-inhibition , and anchorage-dependent growth characteristics were examined by phase contrast microscopy . The cell proliferation rate was assayed by flow cytometry . The modal number of chromosomes was analyzed . HPV18E(6)E(7) was detected by Western blot methods and activities of telomerase were analyzed by TRAP . Tumorigenicity of cells was detected with soft agar plates cultivated and with tumor formation in SCID mice . RESULTS In morphological examination the 10th passage cells were in good differentiation , the 60th and 85th passages cells were in relatively poor differentiation , and the 31st passage cells had two distinct differentiations . The characteristics of the 85th and 60th passage cells were weakened at contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth . Karyotypes of four stages of cells belonged to hyperdiploid or hypotriploid , and bimodal distribution of chromosomes appeared in the 31st and 60th passage cells . All of these characteristics combined with a increasing trend . The activities of telomerase were expressed in the latter three passages . Four fourths of SCID mice in the 85th passage cells and one fourth of SCID mice in the 60th passage cells developed tumors , but the cells in the 10th and 31st passage displayed no tumor formation . CONCLUSION In continual cultivation of fetal esophageal epithelial cells with transduction of HPV18E(6)E(7) , cells from the 10th to the 85th passage were changed gradually from preimmortal , immortal , precancerous to malignantly transformed stages . All of these changes were in a dynamic progressive process . The establishment of a continuous line of esophageal epithelium may provide a in vitro model of carcinogenesis induced by HPV .
Properly regulated keratinocyte cell death is fundamentally important to maintain structural integrity and homeostatic function of epidermis . Moreover , from an oncological perspective , therapeutic approaches selectively targeting apoptosis of malignant cell types while sparing normal keratinocytes in surrounding skin is desirable . Apo2Ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( Apo2L/TRAIL ) has been observed to preferentially induce cytopathic effects on transformed/malignant cell types compared with their non-neoplastic counterparts . In this report , two different biologically active preparations of Apo2L/TRAIL , a non-tagged version , NT-Apo2L/TRAIL , and a leucine zipper fusion protein , LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL , were examined for their ability to trigger apoptosis in normal human keratinocytes , and in an immortalized cell line ( HaCaT cells ) . Differences between these preparations were observed , including : NT-Apo2L/TRAIL induced less keratinocyte apoptosis compared with LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL ; NT-Apo2L/TRAIL also induced less apoptosis of HaCaT cells compared with LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL ; LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL but not NT-Apo2L/TRAIL induced cytotoxic effects when keratinocytes became growth arrested due to undergoing spontaneous replicative senescence--a biological state previously observed to be resistant to UV-light-induced apoptosis . Similarities between preparations included : an enhanced ability for both Apo2L/TRAIL preparations to kill a greater relative percentage of HaCaT cells compared with keratinocytes ; enhanced cytotoxicity towards keratinocytes that had their NF-B activity inhibited ; a dependence of both Apo2L/TRAIL preparations on FADD and caspase activation ; triggering of the same caspase cascades including caspase 8 and 3 ; and an ability to induce apoptosis even when HaCaT cells and keratinocytes were transduced to overexpress either Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) ( survival factors that reduce susceptibility to UV-light-induced apoptosis ) . These results indicate that while both preparations of Apo2L/TRAIL possess biological activity , there are important differences as regards their ability to induce apoptosis in normal and immortalized keratinocytes . Moreover , the death receptor pathway triggered by LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL can overcome the apoptotic resistance normally observed in response to UV-light mediated by Bcl-2/Bcl-x(L) , as well as by the state of cellular senescence . Unraveling the molecular basis for these differential biological effects may reveal a new strategic role for these death receptor/ligands linked to apoptosis in maintaining the dynamic balance of keratinocyte proliferation , differentiation , and cell death necessary to achieve a homeostatic thickness and function of normal skin . In addition , it may be possible to utilize these Apo2L/TRAIL preparations for the treatment of various sun-induced skin cancers as they can differentially trigger apoptosis of transformed keratinocytes , or keratinocytes with abnormal NF-kappaB signaling , while sparing adjacent normal keratinocytes .
The early stages of head and neck cancer are presumed to require a senes of genetic alterations that are not represented by a distinct clinical phenotype . Therefore , genes with altered expression in the preneoplasia may be useful for the early detection of this highly recurrent cancer . In this study , we immortalized normal human oral keratinocytes ( NHOK ) by retroviral-mediated infection of HPV 16 transforming oncogenes , E6 and E7 ( HOK16E6E7 ) . Using the Affymetrix gene chip ( U95Av2 ) , we identified 177 known genes and EST that were overexpressed at least 3-fold or above in the immortalized cells , while 133 were down-regulated compared to NHOK . Northern blot analysis showed elevated levels of p55CDC in the immortalized cells , while NHOK showed high basal expression of small proline rich protein ( SPRR2 ) . The altered expression of these genes maybe associated with cellular proliferation or differentiation and the early stages of oral carcinogenesis .
Contrary to the paradigm that cancer incidence increases indefinitely with age , significant data now suggest cancer incidence may markedly reduce beyond age 80 years for humans and beyond 800 days for mice , and is not inevitable . We show that increasing cellular senescence with age is a possible cause of this reduction , since senescent cells are removed from the pool of cells that retain proliferative ability necessary for cancer . We further show that animal interventions appearing to alter senescence , p53 mutation and melatonin dosing , support the prediction that increasing senescence rate reduces cancer while reducing lifespan , and vice versa . Studies of environmental agents associated with increased cancer might be re-examined to find if there is an association with longevity increases , which may markedly alter our view of such agents . We also show that if an agent functions by slowing both senescence and carcinogenesis , longevity is increased while reducing cancer . Dietary restriction is the only known intervention that accomplishes this , but there may be others .
INTRODUCTION A subpopulation of cancer cells , tumor-initiating cells , is believed to be the driving force behind tumorigenesis and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy . The persistence of tumor-initiating cells may depend on altered regulation of DNA damage and checkpoint proteins , as well as a reduced propensity to undergo apoptosis or senescence . METHODS To test this hypothesis , we isolated CD24-/low/CD44+ tumor-initiating cells ( as mammospheres ) from MCF-7 breast cancer cells grown in adherent monolayer culture , and carried out a comprehensive comparison of cell death and DNA damage response pathways prior to and after exposure to ionizing radiation in mammospheres and monolayer MCF-7 cells . Single and double-strand break repair was measured by single-cell gel electrophoresis . The latter was also examined by phosphorylation of histone H2AX and formation of 53BP1 and Rad51 foci . Apoptosis was quantified by flow-cytometric analysis of annexin V-binding and senescence was analyzed on the basis of cellular beta-galactosidase activity . We employed the telomeric repeat amplification protocol to quantify telomerase activity . Expression of key DNA repair and cell cycle regulatory proteins was detected and quantified by western blot analysis . RESULTS Our data demonstrate that in comparison to the bulk population of MCF-7 cells ( predominantly CD24+/CD44+ ) , the MCF-7 mammosphere cells benefit from a multifaceted approach to cellular protection relative to that seen in monolayer cells , including a reduced level of reactive oxygen species , a more active DNA single-strand break repair ( SSBR ) pathway , possibly due to a higher level of expression of the key SSBR protein , human AP endonuclease 1 ( Ape1 ) , and a significantly reduced propensity to undergo senescence as a result of increased telomerase activity and a low level of p21 protein expression . No significant difference was seen in the rates of double-strand break repair ( DSBR ) between the two cell types , but DSBR in mammospheres appears to by-pass the need for H2AX phosphorylation . CONCLUSIONS Enhanced survival of MCF-7 tumor-initiating cells in response to ionizing radiation is primarily dependent on an inherent down-regulation of the senescence pathway . Since MCF-7 cells are representative of cancer cells that do not readily undergo apoptosis , consideration of senescence pathways may play a role in targeting stem cells from such tumors .
We have previously demonstrated the antiproliferative effect of two flavonoids-2,2'-dihydroxychalcone ( DHC ) , a novel synthetic flavonoid , and fisetin , a naturally occurring flavonol-in prostate cancer cells . In this study , we further examine the mechanisms of these compounds on survival and proliferation pathways . DHC and fisetin ( 1-50 microM ) caused a dose-dependent reduction in viability , a concomitant increase in apoptosis in PC3 cells at 72 h , and a decrease in clonogenic survival at 24 h treatment . DHC was considerably more potent than fisetin in these cytotoxicity assays . The mechanism of accelerated cellular senescence was not activated by either compound in PC3 or lymph node carcinoma of the prostate ( LNCaP ) cells . Gene expression alterations in PC3 and LNCaP cells treated with 15 muM DHC and 25 microM fisetin for 6 to 24 h were determined by oligonucleotide array . Amongst the most highly represented functional categories of genes altered by both compounds was the cell cycle category . In total , 100 cell cycle genes were altered by DHC and fisetin including 27 genes with key functions in G2/M phase that were downregulated by both compounds . Other functional categories altered included chromosome organization , apoptosis , and stress response . These results demonstrate the multiple mechanisms of antitumor activity of DHC and fisetin in prostate cancer cells in vitro .
Cellular senescence is a mechanism to inhibit the growth of mammalian cells after oncogenic activation , or in response to damage or stress . We describe here the identification of a novel gene , SENEX , that regulates stress induced premature senescence pathways in endothelial cells ( ECs ) involving p16(INK4a) and retinoblastoma protein activation . Endogenous levels of SENEX remain unchanged during replicative senescence but are regulated by H(2)O(2)-mediated stress . In contrast to that previously described for senescence in other cell types , the SENEX induced senescent ECs are profoundly anti-inflammatory . The cells are resistant to tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)alpha-induced apoptosis , adhesion of neutrophils and mononuclear cells , and the surface ( but not cytoplasmic ) expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 . Furthermore they are resistant to thrombin induced vascular leak . Senescent ECs such as those lining atherosclerotic lesions may therefore function to limit the inflammatory response . SENEX is also essential for EC survival since depletion either ectopically by siRNA or by high- dose H(2)O(2) treatment causes apoptosis . Together , these findings expand our understanding of the role of senescence in the vasculature and identify SENEX as a fulcrum for driving the resultant phenotype of the endothelium after activation .
BACKGROUND The most deadly form of cancer is not lung or colon , breast or prostate ; it is any cancer that has become metastatic . Mortality due to metastatic melanoma , one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers , has increased steadily over the last several decades . Unfortunately , the arsenal of chemotherapeutic agents available today is most often unsuccessful at extending and improving the life expectancy of afflicted individuals . We sought to identify an effective and nontoxic agent against metastatic melanoma . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We chose to study Cloudman S-91 mouse melanoma cells ( sub-clone M3 , CCL53.1 ) because these cells are highly aggressive and metastatic , representing one of the deadliest types of cancer . Melanoma cells also had an experimental advantage because their morphology , which is easily monitored , relates to the physiology of metastatic cells and normal melanocytes . We chose to test methyl sulfone as a chemotherapeutic agent for two reasons . Because of its chemical structure , we speculated a potential anti-cancer activity by targeting microtubules . Equally important , methyl sulfone has a well-established safety profile in humans . Surprisingly , we found that malignant melanoma cells exposed to methyl sulfone demonstrated the loss of phenotypes characteristic of malignant cells , and the reemergence of phenotypes characteristic of healthy melanocytes . Briefly , over time methyl sulfone induced contact inhibition , loss of ability to migrate through an extracellular matrix , loss of anchorage-independent growth , proper wound healing followed by contact inhibition , irreversible senescence followed by arborization with melanosomes in arbors as seen in normal melanocytes . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Methyl sulfone may have clinical potential as a non-toxic agent effective against metastatic melanoma . Additionally , methyl sulfone has promise as a tool to explore molecular mechanisms of metastatic transformation as well as fundamental processes such as cell migration , contact inhibition , wound healing and cellular senescence .
Evidence suggests that stem-like cells are responsible for initiation , maintenance and recurrence of solid tumors , including Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM ) . GBM is an intractable , highly lethal tumor of the central nervous system . Although epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is highly expressed in many GBMs , anti-EGFR therapies have been unsuccessful as treatment . Few studies have examined EGFR activation in GBM stem cells ( GSCs ) to determine if patient-specific GSCs are amenable to anti-EGFR therapy pre-clinically . We hypothesized that EGFR activation in GSCs varied between patients and was an important determinant of responsiveness to anti-EGFR therapy . Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis was performed on tumor-spheres by immuncytochemistry in the presence and absence of the AG1478 . Second messenger pathways operative in these processes were elucidated by immunoblotting . EGFR activated AKT and inactivated GSK3beta in EGFR+/PTEN+ GSCs . AG1478 and erlotinib significantly decreased the total number of tumor-spheres that EGFR+/ PTEN+ GSCs generated and the rate of sphere formation . Inhibition of EGFR signaling by AG1478 increased GSC senescence and apoptosis , likely via inhibition of AKT and activation of GSK3beta . Sphere formation by EGFR-/ PTEN- GSCs was independent of EGF stimulation , but dependant on B27 growth supplement . Our data suggest that EGFR+/PTEN+ GSCs are susceptible to anti-EGFR therapy in vitro .
Although the p16(INK4a) and p21Waf1/Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitors are known to play key roles in cellular senescence in vitro , their roles in senescence remain rather poorly understood in vivo . This situation is partly due to the possibility of compensatory effect(s) between p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 or to the upregulation of functionally related CDK inhibitors . To directly address the cooperative roles of p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in senescence in vivo , we generated a mouse line simply lacking both p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 genes [ double-knockout ( DKO) ] . Mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEF ) derived from DKO mice displayed no evidence of cellular senescence when cultured serially in vitro . Moreover , DKO MEFs readily escaped Ras-induced senescence and overrode contact inhibition in culture . This was not the case in MEFs lacking either p16INK4a or p21Waf1/Cip1 , indicating that p16(INK4a) and p21Waf1/Cip1 play cooperative roles in cellular senescence and contact inhibition in vitro . Notably , we found the DKO mice to be extremely susceptible to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced skin carcinogenesis that involves oncogenic mutation of the H-ras gene . Mechanistic investigations suggested that the high incidence of cancer in DKO mice likely reflected a cooperative effect of increased benign skin tumor formation caused by p21Waf1/Cip1 loss , with increased malignant conversion of benign skin tumors caused by p16(INK4a) loss . Our findings establish an intrinsic cooperation between p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in the onset of cellular senescence and tumor suppression in vivo .
Modeling the behavior of mammalian arachnoid cells is critical to understand hydrocephalus and other brain disorders involving abnormal flow of cerebrospinal fluid , yet relatively little is known about the physiology of arachnoid cells due to lack of a robust three-dimensional model system . Explanted primary cultures have been the only option to study transport across arachnoid cell membranes , but practical limitations of primary culture include slow growth , early senescence , and poor reproducibility . The purpose of this study was to create immortalized rat arachnoid cell lines to permit in vitro study of arachnoid granulations and properties of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) flow . We established and partially characterized two immortalized cell lines generated from primary rat arachnoid cells , using retroviral gene transfer of SV40 large T antigen ( SV40 LTAg ) either with or without human telomerase ( hTERT ) . The established cell lines stably express either SV40 LTAg alone , or SV40 LTAg and hTERT , and demonstrate high proliferative rate , contact inhibition at confluence , and stable expression of protein markers characteristic of native arachnoid cells over more than 160 passages .
The NF-kB family of transcription factors regulates important biological functions including cell growth , survival and the immune response . We found that Human Papillomavirus type 16 ( HPV-16 ) E7 and E6/E7 proteins inhibited basal and TNF-alpha-inducible NF-kB activity in human epithelial cells cultured from the cervical transformation zone , the anatomic region where most cervical cancers develop . In contrast , HPV-16 E6 regulated NF-kB in a cell type- and cell growth-dependent manner . NF-kB influenced immortalization of cervical cells by HPV16 . Inhibition of NF-kB by an IkB alpha repressor mutant increased colony formation and immortalization by HPV-16 . In contrast , activation of NF-kB by constitutive expression of p65 inhibited proliferation and immortalization . Our results suggest that inhibition of NF-kB by HPV-16 E6/E7 contributes to immortalization of cells from the cervical transformation zone .
Immortalization ( senescence bypass ) is a critical rate-limiting step in the malignant transformation of mammalian somatic cells . Human cells must breach at least two distinct senescence barriers to permit unfettered clonal evolution during cancer development : ( 1 ) stress- or oncogene-induced premature senescence ( SIPS/OIS ) , mediated via the p16-Rb and/or ARF-p53-p21 tumour-suppressive pathways , and ( 2 ) replicative senescence triggered by telomere shortening . In contrast , because their telomerase is constitutively active , cells from small rodents possess only the SIPS/OIS barrier , and are therefore useful for studying SIPS/OIS bypass in isolation . Dermal fibroblasts from the Syrian hamster ( SHD cells ) are exceptionally resistant to spontaneous SIPS bypass , but it can be readily induced following exposure to a wide range of chemical and physical carcinogens . Here we show that a spectrum of carcinogen-specific mutational and epigenetic alterations involving the INK4A ( p16 ) , p53 and INK4B ( p15 ) genes are associated with induced SIPS bypass . With ionizing radiation , immortalization is invariably accompanied by efficient biallelic deletion of the complete INK4/CDKN2 locus . In comparison , SHD cells immortalized by the powerful polycyclic hydrocarbon carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene display transversion point mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53 coupled with INK4 alterations such as loss of expression of p15 . Epimutational silencing of p16 is the primary event associated with immortalization by nickel , a human non-genotoxic carcinogen . As SIPS/OIS bypass is a prerequisite for the immortalization of normal diploid human epithelial cells , our results with the SHD model will provide a basis for delineating combinations of key molecular changes underpinning this important event in human carcinogenesis .
Radiotherapy is commonly used for cancer treatment . However , it often results in side effects due to radiation damage in normal tissue , such as bone marrow ( BM ) failure . Adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPC ) reside in BM next to the endosteal bone surface , which is lined primarily by hematopoietic niche osteoblastic cells . Osteoblasts are relatively more radiation-resistant than HSPCs , but the mechanisms are not well understood . In the present study , we demonstrated that the stress response gene REDD1 ( regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1 ) was highly expressed in human osteoblast cell line ( hFOB ) cells after \u03b3 irradiation . Knockdown of REDD1 with siRNA resulted in a decrease in hFOB cell numbers , whereas transfection of PCMV6-AC-GFP-REDD1 plasmid DNA into hFOB cells inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) and p21 expression and protected these cells from radiation-induced premature senescence ( PS ) . The PS in irradiated hFOB cells were characterized by significant inhibition of clonogenicity , activation of senescence biomarker SA-\u03b2-gal , and the senescence-associated cytokine secretory phenotype ( SASP ) after 4 or 8 Gy irradiation . Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the stress response proteins p53 and nuclear factor \u03ba B ( NFkB ) interacted with REDD1 in hFOB cells . Knockdown of NFkB or p53 gene dramatically suppressed REDD1 protein expression in these cells , indicating that REDD1 was regulated by both factors . Our data demonstrated that REDD1 is a protective factor in radiation-induced osteoblast cell premature senescence .
The functional and therapeutic importance of the Warburg effect is increasingly recognized , and glycolysis has become a target of anticancer strategies . We recently reported the identification of a group of novel small compounds that inhibit basal glucose transport and reduce cancer cell growth by a glucose deprivation-like mechanism . We hypothesized that the compounds target Glut1 and are efficacious in vivo as anticancer agents . Here , we report that a novel representative compound WZB117 not only inhibited cell growth in cancer cell lines but also inhibited cancer growth in a nude mouse model . Daily intraperitoneal injection of WZB117 at 10 mg/kg resulted in a more than 70% reduction in the size of human lung cancer of A549 cell origin . Mechanism studies showed that WZB117 inhibited glucose transport in human red blood cells ( RBC ) , which express Glut1 as their sole glucose transporter . Cancer cell treatment with WZB117 led to decreases in levels of Glut1 protein , intracellular ATP , and glycolytic enzymes . All these changes were followed by increase in ATP-sensing enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) and declines in cyclin E2 as well as phosphorylated retinoblastoma , resulting in cell-cycle arrest , senescence , and necrosis . Addition of extracellular ATP rescued compound-treated cancer cells , suggesting that the reduction of intracellular ATP plays an important role in the anticancer mechanism of the molecule . Senescence induction and the essential role of ATP were reported for the first time in Glut1 inhibitor-treated cancer cells . Thus , WZB117 is a prototype for further development of anticancer therapeutics targeting Glut1-mediated glucose transport and glucose metabolism .
Regulator of Cullins-1 ( ROC1 ) or RING box protein-1 ( RBX1 ) is an essential RING component of Cullin-RING ligase ( CRL ) . Our previous studies showed that ROC1 is required for the growth of several cancer cell lines while ROC1 siRNA silencing inactivates CRL , leading to cell cycle arrest , cell senescence and/or apoptosis . However , it is completely unknown whether ROC1 knockdown triggers autophagic response by inactivating CRL . Moreover , the role of ROC1 in liver cancer remains elusive . In this study , we reported that ROC1 knockdown significantly inhibited the growth of liver cancer cells by sequentially and independently inducing autophagy and p21-dependent cell senescence . Mechanism analysis revealed that ROC1 silencing triggered autophagy by inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) activity due to accumulation of mTOR-inhibitory protein Deptor , a substrate of CRL . Consistently , Deptor knockdown significantly blocked autophagy response upon ROC1 silencing . Biologically , autophagy response upon ROC1 silencing was a survival signal , and blockage of autophagy pathway sensitized cancer cells to apoptosis . Finally , we demonstrated that ROC1 was overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinomas , which is associated with poor prognosis of liver cancer patients . These findings suggest that ROC1 is an appealing drug target for liver cancer and provide a proof-of-concept evidence for a novel drug combination of ROC1 inhibitor and an autophagy inhibitor for effective treatment of liver cancer by enhancing apoptosis.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication , 31 August 2012 ; doi:10.1038/cdd.2012.113 .
Therapy-induced senescence ( TIS ) , a cytostatic stress response in cancer cells , is induced inefficiently by current anticancer agents and radiation . The mechanisms that mediate TIS in cancer cells are not well defined . Herein , we characterize a robust senescence response both in vitro and in vivo to the quinone diaziquone ( AZQ ) , previously identified in a high-throughput senescence-induction small-molecule screen . Using AZQ and several other agents that induce senescence , we screened a series of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and found that p27(Kip1) was induced in all investigated prostate cancer cell lines . The ubiquitin-ligase Skp2 negatively regulates p27(Kip1) and , during TIS , is translocated to the cytoplasm before its expression is decreased in senescent cells . Overexpression of Skp2 blocks the effects of AZQ on senescence and p27(Kip1) induction . We also find that stable long-term short hairpin RNA knockdown of Skp2 decreases proliferation but does not generate the complete senescence phenotype . We conclude that Skp2 participates in regulating TIS but , alone , is insufficient to induce senescence in cancer cells .
Therapy-induced cellular senescence ( TCS ) , characterized by prolonged cell cycle arrest , is an in vivo response of human cancers to chemotherapy and radiation . Unfortunately , TCS is reversible for a subset of senescent cells , leading to cellular reproliferation and ultimately tumor progression . This invariable consequence of TCS recapitulates the clinical treatment experience of patients with advanced cancer . We report the findings of a clinicopathological study in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer demonstrating that marker of in vivo TCS following neoadjuvant therapy prognosticate adverse clinical outcome . In our efforts to elucidate key molecular pathways underlying TCS and cell cycle escape , we have previously shown that the deregulation of mitotic kinase Cdk1 and its downstream effectors are important mediators of survival and cell cycle reentry . We now report that aberrant expression of Cdk1 interferes with apoptosis and promotes the formation of polyploid senescent cells during TCS . These polyploid senescent cells represent important transition states through which escape preferentially occurs . The Cdk1 pathway is in part modulated differentially by p21 and p27 two members of the KIP cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor family during TCS . Altogether , these studies underscore the importance of TCS in cancer therapeutics .
We examined how well the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) E6 oncogene can function in the absence of the E7 oncogene during the carcinogenic process in human keratinocytes using a common HPV variant strongly associated with cervical cancer : the Asian-American E6 variant ( AAE6 ) . This E6 variant is 20 times more frequently detected in cervical cancer than the prototype European E6 variant , as evidenced by independent epidemiological data . Using cell culture and cell-based functional assays , we assessed how this variant can perform crucial carcinogenesis steps compared to the prototype E6 variant . The ability to immortalize and transform primary human foreskin keratinocytes ( PHFKs ) to acquire resilient phenotypes and the ability to promote cell migration were evaluated . The immortalization capability was assayed based on population doublings , number of passages , surpassing mortality stages 1 and 2 , human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) expression , and the ability to overcome G(1) arrest via p53 degradation . Transformation and migration efficiency were analyzed using a combination of functional cell-based assays . We observed that either AAE6 or prototype E6 proteins alone were sufficient to immortalize PHFKs , although AAE6 was more potent in doing so . The AAE6 variant protein alone pushed PHFKs through transformation and significantly increased their migration ability over that of the E6 prototype . Our findings are in line with epidemiological data that the AA variant of HPV16 confers an increased risk over the European prototype for cervical cancer , as evidenced by a superior immortalization , transformation , and metastatic potential .
Liver cancer ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignancy of all cancers worldwide . According to the principles of traditional Chinese medicine , liver Yin deficiency is a common clinical syndrome of liver cancer , and tonifying liver Yin is a common treatment method for liver cancer . However , no hepatocarcinoma-specific liver Yin tonifying formula has yet been established . In the present study , we established a liver cancer-specific combination of herbs , which we term liver Yin tonifying formula ( LYTF ) . We found that LYTF inhibits the proliferation of Bel-7402 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner . LYTF induces apoptosis in Bel-7402 cells , which is accompanied by activation of caspases-8 , -9 and -3 . Pan-caspase blocking completely abrogates LYTF-induced apoptosis and partially abrogates LYTF-induced proliferation inhibition . LYTF also induces cell senescence , as indicated by a large and flattened morphology , senescence-activated beta-galactosidase-positive staining and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest , accompanied by the up-regulation of p16 and p21 and the down-regulation of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation . These findings suggest that LYTF is effective in inhibiting the growth and survival of hepatocarcinoma cells through the induction of apoptosis and cell senescence . Our study also provides insight into traditional Chinese medicine methods used for the treatment of liver cancer .
Cellular senescence can be a functional barrier to carcinogenesis . We hypothesized that inflammation modulates carcinogenesis through senescence and DNA damage response ( DDR ) . We examined the association between senescence and DDR with macrophage levels in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . In vitro experiments tested the ability of macrophages to induce senescence in primary cells . Inflammation modulating microRNAs were identified in senescence colon tissue for further investigation .
p21 is a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that plays a role in promoting G1 cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence . Consistent with this role , p21 is a downstream target of several tumour suppressors and oncogenes , and it is downregulated in the majority of tumours , including breast cancer . Here , we report that protein arginine methyltransferase 6 ( PRMT6 ) , a type I PRMT known to act as a transcriptional cofactor , directly represses the p21 promoter . PRMT6 knock-down ( KD ) results in a p21 derepression in breast cancer cells , which is p53-independent , and leads to cell cycle arrest , cellular senescence and reduced growth in soft agar assays and in severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) mice for all the cancer lines examined . We finally show that bypassing the p21-mediated arrest rescues PRMT6 KD cells from senescence , and it restores their ability to grow on soft agar . We conclude that PRMT6 acts as an oncogene in breast cancer cells , promoting growth and preventing senescence , making it an attractive target for cancer therapy .
UNLABELLED Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is a major liver malignancy . We previously demonstrated that deregulation of epigenetic regulators is a common event in human HCC . Suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 ( SUV39H1 ) , the prototype of histone methyltransferase , is the major enzyme responsible for histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation , which , essentially , is involved in heterochromatin formation , chromosome segregation , and mitotic progression . However , the implication of SUV39H1 in hepatocarcinogenesis remains elusive . In this study , we found that SUV39H1 was frequently up-regulated in human HCCs and was significantly associated with increased Ki67 expression ( P < 0.001 ) and the presence of venous invasion ( P = 0.017 ) . To investigate the role of SUV39H1 in HCC development , both gain- and loss-of-function models were established . SUV39H1 overexpression remarkably enhanced HCC cell clonogenicity , whereas knockdown of SUV39H1 substantially suppressed HCC cell proliferation and induced cell senescence . In addition , ectopic expression of SUV39H1 increased the migratory ability of HCC cells , whereas a reduced migration rate was observed in SUV39H1 knockdown cells . The significance of SUV39H1 in HCC was further demonstrated in a nude mice model ; SUV39H1 knockdown drastically inhibited in vivo tumorigenicity and abolished pulmonary metastasis of HCC cells . We also identified microRNA-125b ( miR-125b ) as a post-transcriptional regulator of SUV39H1 . Ectopic expression of miR-125b inhibited SUV39H1 3'-untranslated-region-coupled luciferase activity and suppressed endogenous SUV39H1 expression at both messenger RNA and protein levels . We have previously reported frequent down-regulation of miR-125b in HCC . Interestingly , miR-125b level was found to be inversely correlated with SUV39H1 expression ( P = 0.001 ) in clinical specimens . Our observations suggested that miR-125b down-regulation may account for the aberrant SUV39H1 level in HCC . CONCLUSION Our study demonstrated that SUV39H1 up-regulation contributed to HCC development and metastasis . The tumor-suppressive miR-125b served as a negative regulator of SUV39H1 .
Overexpression of cyclin D1 is believed to endow mammary epithelial cells ( MEC ) with a proliferative advantage by virtue of its contribution to pRB inactivation . Accordingly , abrogation of the kinase-dependent function of cyclin D1 is sufficient to render mice resistant to breast cancer initiated by ErbB2 . Here , we report that mouse cyclin D1(KE/KE) MECs ( deficient in cyclin D1 activity ) upregulate an autophagy-like process but fail to implement ErbB2-induced senescence in vivo . In addition , immortalized cyclin D1(KE/KE) MECs retain high rates of autophagy and reduced ErbB2-mediated transformation in vitro . However , highlighting its dual role during tumorigenesis , downregulation of autophagy led to an increase in senescence in cyclin D1(KE/KE) MECs . Autophagy upregulation was also confirmed in human mammary epithelial cells ( HMEC ) subjected to genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of cyclin D1 activity and , similar to our murine system , simultaneous inhibition of Cdk4/6 and autophagy in HMECs enhanced the senescence response . Collectively , our findings suggest a previously unrecognized function of cyclin D1 in suppressing autophagy in the mammary epithelium . Cancer Res ; 72(24) ; 6477-89. <FFFD>2012 AACR .
Neural stem cells ( NSCs ) are considered to be the cell of origin of glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . However , the genetic alterations that transform NSCs into glioma-initiating cells remain elusive . Using a unique transposon mutagenesis strategy that mutagenizes NSCs in culture , followed by additional rounds of mutagenesis to generate tumors in vivo , we have identified genes and signaling pathways that can transform NSCs into glioma-initiating cells . Mobilization of Sleeping Beauty transposons in NSCs induced the immortalization of astroglial-like cells , which were then able to generate tumors with characteristics of the mesenchymal subtype of GBM on transplantation , consistent with a potential astroglial origin for mesenchymal GBM . Sequence analysis of transposon insertion sites from tumors and immortalized cells identified more than 200 frequently mutated genes , including human GBM-associated genes , such as Met and Nf1 , and made it possible to discriminate between genes that function during astroglial immortalization vs. later stages of tumor development . We also functionally validated five GBM candidate genes using a previously undescribed high-throughput method . Finally , we show that even clonally related tumors derived from the same immortalized line have acquired distinct combinations of genetic alterations during tumor development , suggesting that tumor formation in this model system involves competition among genetically variant cells , which is similar to the Darwinian evolutionary processes now thought to generate many human cancers . This mutagenesis strategy is faster and simpler than conventional transposon screens and can potentially be applied to any tissue stem/progenitor cells that can be grown and differentiated in vitro .
Centrosome overduplication or amplification has been observed in many human cancers and in premalignant tissue , but the mechanisms leading to such centrosome aberrations are not fully understood . We previously showed that abnormal mitotic cells with supernumerary centrosomes increase with replicative senescence in human fibroblasts , especially in a polyploid subpopulation . This study examines localization of p53 protein at centrosomes in mitotic cells , which is often observed in association with DNA damage response , to investigate a possible association between p53 localization and numerical centrosome aberrations induced by cellular senescence . Cultures at later passages or the 4th day after exposure to H(2)O(2) showed increased frequencies of mitotic cells with supernumerary centrosomes , especially in a polyploid subpopulation . Immunohistochemical analysis frequently showed p53-positive foci in mitotic cells , and some were localized at centrosomes . The number of p53-positive foci in mitotic cells and its localization to centrosomes increased with replicative and premature senescence . Supernumerary centrosomes showed higher frequencies of p53 localization compared to normally duplicated centrosomes . Centrosome-associated p53 protein was phosphorylated at Ser15 . These data suggest a possible association between localization of p53 protein and numerical centrosome aberrations in replicatively or prematurely senescent cells .
Blind mole rats Spalax ( BMR ) are small subterranean rodents common in the Middle East . BMR is distinguished by its adaptations to life underground , remarkable longevity ( with a maximum documented lifespan of 21 y ) , and resistance to cancer . Spontaneous tumors have never been observed in spalacids . To understand the mechanisms responsible for this resistance , we examined the growth of BMR fibroblasts in vitro of the species Spalax judaei and Spalax golani . BMR cells proliferated actively for 7-20 population doublings , after which the cells began secreting IFN-\u03b2 , and the cultures underwent massive necrotic cell death within 3 d . The necrotic cell death phenomenon was independent of culture conditions or telomere shortening . Interestingly , this cell behavior was distinct from that observed in another long-lived and cancer-resistant African mole rat , Heterocephalus glaber , the naked mole rat in which cells display hypersensitivity to contact inhibition . Sequestration of p53 and Rb proteins using SV40 large T antigen completely rescued necrotic cell death . Our results suggest that cancer resistance of BMR is conferred by massive necrotic response to overproliferation mediated by p53 and Rb pathways , and triggered by the release of IFN-\u03b2 . Thus , we have identified a unique mechanism that contributes to cancer resistance of this subterranean mammal extremely adapted to life underground .
Progression to malignancy requires that cells overcome senescence and switch to an immortal phenotype . Thus , exploring the genetic and epigenetic changes that occur during senescence/immortalization may help elucidate crucial events that lead to cell transformation . In the present study , we have globally profiled DNA methylation in relation to gene expression in primary , senescent and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts . Using a high-resolution genome-wide mapping technique , followed by extensive locus-specific validation assays , we have identified 24 CpG islands that display significantly higher levels of CpG methylation in immortalized cell lines as compared to primary murine fibroblasts . Several of these hypermethylated CpG islands are associated with genes involved in the MEK-ERK pathway , one of the most frequently disrupted pathways in cancer . Approximately half of the hypermethylated targets are developmental regulators , and bind to the repressive Polycomb group ( PcG ) proteins , often in the context of bivalent chromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells . Because PcG-associated aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of several human malignancies , our methylation data suggest that epigenetic reprogramming of pluripotency genes may initiate cell immortalization . Consistent with methylome alterations , global gene expression analysis reveals that the vast majority of genes dysregulated during cell immortalization belongs to gene families that converge into the MEK-ERK pathway . Additionally , several dysregulated members of the MAP kinase network show concomitant hypermethylation of CpG islands . Unlocking alternative epigenetic routes for cell immortalization will be paramount for understanding crucial events leading to cell transformation . Unlike genetic alterations , epigenetic changes are reversible events , and as such , can be amenable to pharmacological interventions , which makes them appealing targets for cancer therapy when genetic approaches prove inadequate .
Senescence is a cellular response preventing tumorigenesis . The Ras oncogene is frequently activated or mutated in human cancers , but Ras activation is insufficient to transform primary cells . Ina search for cooperating oncogenes , we identify the lysine demethylase JMJD2A/KDM4A . We show that JMJD2A functions as a negative regulator of Ras-induced senescence and collaborates with oncogenic Ras to promote cellular transformation by negatively regulating the p53 pathway . We find CHD5 , a known tumor suppressor regulating p53 activity , as a target of JMJD2A . The expression of JMJD2A inhibits Ras-mediated CHD5 induction leading to a reduced activity of the p53 pathway . In addition , we show that JMJD2A is overexpressed inmouse and human lung cancers . Depletion of JMJD2A in the human lung cancer cell line A549 bearing an activated K-Ras allele triggers senescence . We propose that JMJD2A is an oncogene that represents a target for Ras-expressing tumors .
The anthracycline doxorubicin is a widely used effective anti-cancer drug . However , its application and dosage are severely limited due to its cardiotoxicity . The exact mechanisms of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxic side effects remain poorly understood . Even less is known about the impact of doxorubicin treatment on vascular damage . We found that low doses of doxorubicin induced a senescent response in human primary vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMC ) . We observed that expression of urokinase receptor ( uPAR ) was upregulated in response to doxorubicin . Furthermore , the level of uPAR expression played a decisive role in developing doxorubicin-induced senescence. uPAR silencing in human VSMC by means of RNA interference as well as uPAR knockout in mouse VSMC resulted in abrogation of doxorubicin-induced cellular senescence . On the contrary , uPAR overexpression promoted VSMC senescence . We further found that proteasomal degradation of telomeric repeat binding factor 2 ( TRF2 ) mediates doxorubicin-induced VSMC senescence . Our results demonstrate that uPAR controls the ubiquitin-proteasome system in VSMC and regulates doxorubicin-induced TRF2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation via this mechanism . Therefore , VSMC senescence induced by low doses of doxorubicin may contribute to vascular damage upon doxorubicin treatment. uPAR-mediated TRF2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are further identified as a molecular mechanism underlying this process .
Metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells provides energy and multiple intermediates critical for cell growth . Hypoxia in tumors represents a hostile environment that can encourage these transformations . We report that glycogen metabolism is upregulated in tumors invivo and in cancer cells invitro in response to hypoxia . Invitro , hypoxia induced an early accumulation of glycogen , followed bya gradual decline . Concordantly , glycogen synthase ( GYS1 ) showed a rapid induction , followed by a later increase of glycogen phosphorylase ( PYGL ) . PYGL depletion and the consequent glycogen accumulation led to increased reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) levels that contributed to a p53-dependent induction of senescence and markedly impaired tumorigenesis invivo . Metabolic analyses indicated that glycogen degradation by PYGL is important for the optimal function of the pentose phosphate pathway . Thus , glycogen metabolism is a key pathway induced by hypoxia , necessary for optimal glucose utilization , which represents a targetable mechanism of metabolic adaptation .
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein consisting of a catalytic subunit , the telomerase reverse transcriptase , TERT , and an integrally associated RNA , TR , which contains a template for the synthesis of short repetitive G-rich DNA sequences at the ends of telomeres . Telomerase can repetitively reverse transcribe its short RNA template , acting processively to add multiple telomeric repeats onto the same DNA substrate . The contribution of enzyme processivity to telomere length regulation in human cells is not well characterized . In cancer cells , under homeostatic telomere length-maintenance conditions , telomerase acts processively , while under nonequilibrium conditions , telomerase acts distributively on the shortest telomeres . To investigate the role of increased telomerase processivity on telomere length regulation in human cells with limited lifespan that are dependent on human TERT ( hTERT ) for lifespan extension and immortalization , we mutated the leucine at position 866 in the reverse transcriptase C motif of hTERT to a tyrosine ( L866Y ) , which is the amino acid found at a similar position in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase . We report that , similar to the previously reported ' gain of function ' Tetrahymena telomerase mutant ( L813Y ) , the human telomerase variant displays increased processivity. hTERT-L866Y , like wild-type hTERT can immortalize and extend the lifespan of limited lifespan cells . Moreover , hTERT-L866Y expressing cells display heterogenous telomere lengths , telomere elongation , multiple telomeric signals indicative of fragile sites and replicative stress , and an increase in short telomeres , which is accompanied by telomere trimming events . Our results suggest that telomere length and homeostasis in human cells may be regulated by telomerase enzyme processivity .
PURPOSE : Previous studies have shown that the novel microtubule poison , JG-03-14 , which binds to the colchicine binding site of tubulin , has the capacity to kill breast tumor cells primarily through the promotion of autophagy . The current work was designed to determine whether autophagy was , in fact , the primary mode of action as well as susceptibility to JG-03-14 in two additional tumor cell models , the B16/F10 murine melanoma cell line and the HCT-116 human colon cancer cell line . METHODS : Drug cytotoxicity was monitored based on viable cell number and clonogenic survival . Apoptosis was assessed by DAPI staining , the TUNEL assay and/or FACS analysis . Autophagy was monitored based on staining with acridine orange , redistribution and punctuation of RFP-LC3 and electron microscopy as well as p62 degradation . Senescence was evaluated based on beta-galactosidase staining and alterations in cell morphology . Drug effects were also evaluated in a murine model of B16/F10 cells that localizes to the lungs while peripheral neuropathy was assessed by three complementary behavioral assays . RESULTS : Both HCT-116 colon cancer cells and B16/F10 melanoma cells were sensitive to JG-03-14 in that the drug demonstrated tumor cell killing . However , there was minimal induction of apoptosis . In contrast , there was clear evidence for autophagy and autophagic flux while the residual surviving cells appeared to be in a state of irreversible senescence . Inhibition of drug-induced autophagy in either the melanoma cells or the colon carcinoma cells was only slightly protective as the cells instead died by apoptosis . JG-03-14 reduced the size of tumor nodules in mice lungs ; furthermore , the drug did not promote peripheral neuropathy . CONCLUSIONS : Taken together with evidence for its actions as a vascular disrupting agent , these observations support the potential utility of JG-03-14 to effectively treat malignancies that might be resistant to conventional chemotherapy through evasion of apoptosis .
When the cell cycle is arrested , even though growth-promoting pathways such as mTOR are still active , then cells senesce . For example , induction of either p21 or p16 arrests the cell cycle without inhibiting mTOR , which , in turn , converts p21/p16-induced arrest into senescence ( geroconversion ) . Here we show that geroconversion is accompanied by dramatic accumulation of cyclin D1 followed by cyclin E and replicative stress . When p21 was switched off , senescent cells ( despite their loss of proliferative potential ) progressed through S phase , and levels of cyclins D1 and E dropped . Most cells entered mitosis and then died , either during mitotic arrest or after mitotic slippage , or underwent endoreduplication . Next , we investigated whether inhibition of mTOR would prevent accumulation of cyclins and loss of mitotic competence in p21-arrested cells . Both nutlin-3 , which inhibits mTOR in these cells , and rapamycin suppressed geroconversion during p21-induced arrest , decelerated accumulation of cyclins D1 and E and decreased replicative stress . When p21 was switched off , cells successfully progressed through both S phase and mitosis . Also , senescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) overexpressed cyclin D1 . After release from cell cycle arrest , senescent MEFs entered S phase but could not undergo mitosis and did not proliferate . We conclude that cellular senescence is characterized by futile hyper-mitogenic drive associated with mTOR-dependent mitotic incompetence .
The mechanisms by which hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSC and HPC ) from myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) undergo ineffective production of blood cells and disease transformation into acute myeloid leukemia remain to be investigated . It has been confirmed that increased production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) under various pathological conditions impairs HSC self-renewal and causes HSC premature exhaustion and BM suppression primarily via induction of HSC senescence , and oncogene induces accumulation of ROS and DNA damage and subsequently cellular senescence , which functions as an important barrier to prevent the growth of transformed cells to form a neoplasia . Here we investigated whether MDS CD34(+) cells enriched with HSC and HPC undergo senescence through accumulation of ROS and DNA damage and their action mechanisms . In this study , the percentages of SA-beta-gal positive senescent CD34(+) cells increased in lower-risk MDS patients , but not in higher-risk MDS and AML patients , compared to that of healthy controls . The increases were associated with an elevated expression of p21 but not the activation of p38 . Further study found that there were increased ROS and DNA damage in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells enriched with HSC progression from lower-risk MDS , higher-risk MDS to AML . Therefore , these data suggest that CD34(+) cells from patients with lower-risk MDS present p21 dependent premature senescence , increased accumulation of ROS and DNA damage in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells could contribute to this process ; however , CD34(+) cells from patients with higher-risk MDS could develop some mechanisms to uncouple ROS and DNA damage induced senescence .
MYC deregulation is common in human cancer . IG-MYC translocations that are modeled in Emu-Myc mice occur in almost all cases of Burkitt lymphoma as well as in other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders . Deregulated expression of MYC results in increased mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) signaling . As tumors with mTORC1 activation are sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition , we used everolimus , a potent and specific mTORC1 inhibitor , to test the requirement for mTORC1 in the initiation and maintenance of Emu-Myc lymphoma . Everolimus selectively cleared premalignant B cells from the bone marrow and spleen , restored a normal pattern of B-cell differentiation , and strongly protected against lymphoma development . Established Emu-Myc lymphoma also regressed after everolimus therapy . Therapeutic response correlated with a cellular senescence phenotype and induction of p53 activity . Therefore , mTORC1-dependent evasion of senescence is critical for cellular transformation and tumor maintenance by MYC in B lymphocytes .
The ASPP2 ( also known as 53BP2L ) tumor suppressor is a proapoptotic member of a family of p53 binding proteins that functions in part by enhancing p53-dependent apoptosis via its C-terminal p53-binding domain . Mounting evidence also suggests that ASPP2 harbors important nonapoptotic p53-independent functions . Structural studies identify a small G protein Ras-association domain in the ASPP2 N terminus . Because Ras-induced senescence is a barrier to tumor formation in normal cells , we investigated whether ASPP2 could bind Ras and stimulate the protein kinase Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade . We now show that ASPP2 binds to Ras-GTP at the plasma membrane and stimulates Ras-induced signaling and pERK1/2 levels via promoting Ras-GTP loading , B-Raf/C-Raf dimerization , and C-Raf phosphorylation . These functions require the ASPP2 N terminus because BBP ( also known as 53BP2S ) , an alternatively spliced ASPP2 isoform lacking the N terminus , was defective in binding Ras-GTP and stimulating Raf/MEK/ERK signaling . Decreased ASPP2 levels attenuated H-RasV12-induced senescence in normal human fibroblasts and neonatal human epidermal keratinocytes . Together , our results reveal a mechanism for ASPP2 tumor suppressor function via direct interaction with Ras-GTP to stimulate Ras-induced senescence in nontransformed human cells .
The down-regulation of dominant oncogenes , including C-MYC , in tumor cells often leads to the induction of senescence via mechanisms that are not completely identified . In the current study , we demonstrate that MYC-depleted melanoma cells undergo extensive DNA damage that is caused by the underexpression of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) and ribonucleotide reductase ( RR ) and subsequent depletion of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools . Simultaneous genetic inhibition of TS and RR in melanoma cells induced DNA damage and senescence phenotypes very similar to the ones caused by MYC-depletion . Reciprocally , overexpression of TS and RR in melanoma cells or addition of deoxyribo-nucleosides to culture media substantially inhibited DNA damage and senescence-associated phenotypes caused by C-MYC depletion . Our data demonstrate the essential role of TS and RR in C-MYC-dependent suppression of senescence in melanoma cells .
The activity of DNA methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1 ) is associated with diverse biological activities , including cell proliferation , senescence and cancer development . Here , we demonstrated that the HMG box-containing protein 1 ( HBP1 ) transcription factor is a new repressor of DNMT1 in a complex mechanism during senescence . The DNMT1 gene contains an HBP1-binding site at position -115 to -134bp from the transcriptional start site . HBP1 repressed the endogenous DNMT1 gene through sequence-specific binding , resulting in both gene-specific ( e.g. p16(INK4) ) and global DNA hypomethylation changes . The HBP1-mediated repression by DNMT1 contributed to replicative and premature senescence , the latter of which could be induced by Ras and HBP1 itself . A detailed investigation unexpectedly revealed that HBP1 has dual and complex transcriptional functions-both of which contribute to premature senescence . HBP1 both repressed the DNMT1 gene and activated the p16 gene in premature senescence . The opposite transcriptional functions proceeded through different DNA sequences and differential protein acetylation . While intricate , the reciprocal partnership between HBP1 and DNMT1 has exceptional importance , since its abrogation compromises senescence and promotes tumorigenesis . Together , our results suggest that the HBP1 transcription factor orchestrates a complex regulation of key genes during cellular senescence with an impact on overall DNA methylation state .
The ATM/ATR DNA damage checkpoint functions in the maintenance of genetic stability and some missense variants of the ATM gene have been shown to confer a moderate increased risk of prostate cancer . However , whether inactivation of this checkpoint contributes directly to prostate specific cancer predisposition is still unknown . Here , we show that exposure of non-malignant prostate epithelial cells ( HPr-1AR ) to androgen led to activation of the ATM/ATR DNA damage response and induction of cellular senescence . Notably , knockdown of the ATM gene expression in HPr-1AR cells can promote androgen-induced TMPRSS2 : ERG rearrangement , a prostate-specific chromosome translocation frequently found in prostate cancer cells . Intriguingly , unlike the non-malignant prostate epithelial cells , the ATM/ATR DNA damage checkpoint appears to be defective in prostate cancer cells , since androgen treatment only induced a partial activation of the DNA damage response . This mechanism appears to preserve androgen induced autophosphorylation of ATM and phosphorylation of H2AX , lesion processing and repair pathway yet restrain ATM/CHK1/CHK2 and p53 signaling pathway . Our findings demonstrate that ATM/ATR inactivation is a crucial step in promoting androgen-induced genomic instability and prostate carcinogenesis .
Loss of p53 is considered to allow progression of colorectal tumors from the adenoma to the carcinoma stage . Using mice with an intestinal epithelial cell ( IEC)-specific p53 deletion , we demonstrate that loss ofp53 alone is insufficient to initiate intestinal tumorigenesis but markedly enhances carcinogen-induced tumor incidence and leads to invasive cancer and lymph node metastasis . Whereas p53 controls DNA damage and IEC survival during the initiation stage , loss of p53 during tumor progression is associated with increased intestinal permeability , causing formation of an NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory microenvironment and the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition . Thus , we propose a p53-controlled tumor-suppressive function that is independent of its well-established role in cell-cycle regulation , apoptosis , and senescence .
Recent studies have highlighted an apparently paradoxical link between self-renewal and senescence triggered by DNA damage in certain cell types . In addition , the finding that TP53 can suppress senescence has caused a re-evaluation of its functional role in regulating these outcomes . To investigate these phenomena and their relationship to pluripotency and senescence , we examined the response of the TP53-competent embryonal carcinoma ( EC ) cell line PA1 to etoposide-induced DNA damage . Nuclear POU5F1/OCT4A and p21cip1 were upregulated in the same cells following etoposide-induced G 2M arrest . However , while accumulating in the karyosol , the amount of OCT4A was reduced in the chromatin fraction . Phosphorylated CHK2 and Rad51/gammaH2AX-positive nuclear foci , overexpression of Aurora B kinase and moderate macroautophagy were evident . Upon release from G 2M arrest , cells with repaired DNA entered mitoses , while the cells with persisting DNA damage remained at this checkpoint or underwent mitotic slippage and gradually senesced . Reduction of TP53 using sh- or si-RNA prevented the upregulation of OCT4A and p21cip1 and increased DNA damage . Subsequently , mitoses , micronucleation and senescence were all enhanced after TP53 reduction with senescence confirmed by upregulation of CDKN2A/p16ink4a and increased sa-beta-galactosidase positivity . Those mitoses enhanced by TP53 silencing were shown to be multicentrosomal and multi-polar , containing fragmented and highly deranged chromosomes , indicating a loss of genome integrity . Together , these data suggest that TP53-dependent coupling of self-renewal and senescence pathways through the DNA damage checkpoint provides a mechanism for how embryonal stem cell-like EC cells safeguard DNA integrity , genome stability and ultimately the fidelity of self-renewal .
Here , we provide the necessary proof of concept , that it is possible to metabolically create a non-permissive or " hostile " stromal microenvironment , which actively prevents tumor engraftment in vivo . We developed a novel genetically engineered fibroblast cell line that completely prevents tumor formation in mice , with a 100% protection rate . No host side effects were apparent.This could represent a viable cellular strategy for preventing and treating a variety of human cancers . More specifically , we examined the autocrine and paracrine effects of the cellular delivery of TNF-alpha on breast cancer tumor growth and cancer metabolism . For this purpose , we recombinantly overexpressed TNF-alpha in human breast cancer cells ( MDA-MB-231 ) or human immortalized fibroblasts ( hTERT-BJ1 ) . Our results directly show that TNF-alpha functions as a potent tumor suppressor . Remarkably , TNF-alpha-expressing breast cancer cells were viable , without any significant increases in their basal apoptotic rate . However , after 4 weeks post-implantation , TNF-alpha-expressing breast cancer cells failed to form any tumors in xenografted mice ( 0 tumors/10 injections ) , ultimately conferring 100% protection against tumorigenesis . Similarly , TNF-alpha-overexpressing fibroblasts were also viable , without any increases in apoptosis . Significantly , complete tumor suppression was obtained by co-injecting TNF-alpha expressing stromal fibroblasts with human breast cancer cells , indicating that paracrine cell-mediated delivery of TNF-alpha can also prevent tumor engraftment and growth ( 0 tumors/10 injections ) . Mechanistically , TNF-alpha induced autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in both epithelial cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts , preventing energy transfer from the tumor microenvironment , likely " starving " the cancer cells to death . In addition , via qRT-PCR analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells , we observed that TNF-alpha mediated the up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with inflammation and senescence [ IL-1-beta , IL-6 , IL-8 , MCP-1 , COX-2 , p21(WAF1/CIP1) ] and downregulated known tumor-promoting genes ( collagen VI and MMP2 ) . Recombinant overexpression of TNF-alpha receptor(s) in MDA-MB-231 cells also significantly reduced tumor growth , but was not as effective as the TNF-alpha ligand itself in preventing tumor growth . Thus , we propose that stromal cell-mediated delivery of TNF-alpha to human tumors [ using transfected fibroblasts or mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs) ] may be a novel and effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of human cancers .
Cellular senescence , an irreversible cell cycle arrest induced by a diversity of stimuli , has been considered as an innate tumor suppressing mechanism with implications and applications in cancer therapy . Using a targeted proteomics approach , we show that fibroblasts induced into senescence by expression of oncogenic Ras exhibit a decrease of global acetylation on all core histones , consistent with formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci . We also detected clear increases in repressive markers ( e.g. >50% elevation of H3K27me2/3 ) along with decreases in histone marks associated with increased transcriptional expression/elongation ( e.g . H3K36me2/3 ) . Despite the increases in repressive marks of chromatin , 179 loci ( of 2206 total ) were found to be upregulated by global quantitative proteomics . The changes in the cytosolic proteome indicated an upregulation of mitochondrial proteins and downregulation of proteins involved in glycolysis . These alterations in primary metabolism are opposite to the well-known Warburg effect observed in cancer cells . This study significantly improves our understanding of stress-induced senescence and provides a potential application for triggering it in antiproliferative strategies that target the primary metabolism in cancer cells .
Aims : RAS-induced tumorigenesis has been suggested to follow a three-stage model consisting of an initial RAS activation , senescence induction , and evasion of p53-dependent senescence checkpoints . While reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) act as second messengers in RAS-induced senescence , they are also involved in oncogenic transformation by inducing proliferation and promoting mutations . In the current work , we investigated the role of extracellular superoxide dismutase ( SOD3 ) in RAS-induced senescence and immortalization in vitro and in vivo . We used a mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) primary cell model together with immortalized and transformed human cell lines derived from papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer . Results : Based on our data , sod3 RNA interference in H-RasV12-transduced cells markedly inhibited cell growth , while sod3 over-expression in MEFs initially caused a proliferative burst followed by the activation of DNA damage checkpoints , induction of p53-p21 signal transduction , and senescence . Subsequently , sod3-transduced MEF cells developed co-operative p21-p16 down-regulation and acquired transformed cell characteristics such as increased telomerase activity , loss of contact inhibition , growth in low-nutrient conditions , and in vivo tumorigenesis . Interestingly , as reported previously with RAS , we showed a dose-dependent response to SOD3 in vitro and in vivo involving transcriptional and non-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms . Innovation : SOD3 may mediate H-RasV12-induced initiation of primary cell immortalization . Conclusions : Our results indicate that SOD3 influences growth signaling in primary and cancer cells downstream of the ras oncogene and could serve as a therapy target at an early tumorigenesis phase .
