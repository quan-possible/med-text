A persistent immune response to hepatitis viruses is a well-recognized risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma . However , the molecular and cellular basis for the procarcinogenic potential of the immune response is not well defined . Here , using a unique animal model of chronic hepatitis that induces hepatocellular carcinogenesis , we demonstrate that neutralization of the activity of Fas ligand prevented hepatocyte apoptosis , proliferation , liver inflammation , and the eventual development of hepatocellular carcinoma . The results indicate that Fas ligand is involved not only in direct hepatocyte killing but also in the process of inflammation and hepatocellular carcinogenesis in chronic hepatitis . This is the first demonstration that amelioration of chronic inflammation by some treatment actually caused reduction of cancer development .
Human esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) develops in a sequence from gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , columnar-lined esophagus ( CLE ) , dysplasia , and eventually to EAC . We established a rat surgical EAC model with esophagogastroduodenal anastomosis ( EGDA ) to mimic the staged process of esophageal adenocarcinogenesis . Profiling of the AA metabolites with mass spectrometry showed that prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) , 15-hydroeicosatetraenoic acid ( HETE ) , 12-HETE , 8-HETE and 5-HETE all increased at the esophagoduodenal junction after EGDA as compared with the proximal esophagus , with PGE2 as the major metabolite . Consistent with this profile , cyclooxygenase 2 ( Cox2 ) was overexpressed in the basal cell layer of esophageal squamous epithelium , CLE cells and EAC tumor cells of the EGDA rats , as compared with the normal esophageal epithelium . Sulindac ( a Cox inhibitor ) , nordihydroguaiaretic acid ( NDGA , a lipoxygenase inhibitor ) and alpha-difluoromethylornithine ( DFMO , an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor ) were tested for their possible inhibitory actions against the formation of EAC in the rat EGDA model . In a short-term study ( for 4 weeks after surgery ) , dietary administration of both sulindac ( 300 and 600 p.p.m. ) and NDGA ( 100 p.p.m. ) effectively reduced the EGDA-induced inflammation . In a long-term chemoprevention study ( for 40 weeks after surgery ) , 300 p.p.m. sulindac , alone or in combination with 100 p.p.m . NDGA or 0.5% DFMO , decreased the tumor incidence from 57.7 to 26.9% , or 16.7 or 20% , respectively ( P < 0.05 ) . NDGA alone ( 100 and 200 p.p.m. ) slightly decreased the tumor incidence to 52.4 and 37% , respectively , although the difference was not statistically significant . DFMO alone did not show significant effects on tumor incidence . Inhibition of tumor formation by sulindac was correlated with lowered levels of PGE2 . In conclusion , sulindac exerted its chemopreventive effect against the formation of EAC in the rat EGDA model possibly through its inhibition of Cox .
During the period of 1996-1998 ninety-four gastrectomy specimens with gastric carcinoma referred to Erciyes University , Medical Faculty , Department of Pathology , were examined histopathologically , histochemically and immunohistochemically . General characteristics of gastric carcinomas and prognostic factors were studied . According the Lauren classification , of the 94 cases of gastric carcinomas , 56 were intestinal type , 21 were diffuse type and 17 were mixed type carcinoma . The association rates of Helicobacter pylori , chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia with gastric carcinomas were high . There was strong immunorectivity with HSP70 in 62,5% of the intestinal type carcinomas . This ratios were lower in diffuse and mixed type carcinomas ( p<0.05 ) . The more tumor size and invasion depth increased , the more HSP70 immunoreactivity was obtained ( p<0.05 ) . HSP70 immunorectivity was considerably higher in the patients having lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion ( p<0.05 ) . It was found that the NK cell number was low in the tumor but higher around the tumor in early gastric carcinomas , compared with advanced carcinomas ( p>0.05 ) . In the tumors larger than 10 cm with vascular invasion , NK cell number was lower around the tumor ( p>0.05 ) . Defining prognostic factors of gastric carcinomas is of importance to clinicians . It is thought that HSP70 immunoreactivity , besides invasion depth , lymph node metastasis , vascular invasion , tumor size and inflammatory reaction against the tumor , is important in prognosis and associated with advanced stage .
Previous experiments have shown that emodin is highly active in suppressing the proliferation of several tumor cell lines . However , it is not clear that emodin can induce growth inhibition of hepatoma cells . We have found that emodin induces apoptotic responses in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines ( HCC ) Mahlavu , PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 . The addition of emodin to these three cell lines led to inhibition of growth in a time- and dose-dependent manner . Emodin generated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in these cells which brought about a reduction of the intracellular mitochondrial transmembrane potential ( DeltaPsim ) , followed by the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 , leading to DNA fragmentation and apoptosis . Our findings demonstrate that ROS and the resulting oxidative stress play a pivotal role in apoptosis . Preincubation of hepatoma cell lines with the hydrogen peroxide-scavenging enzyme , catalase ( CAT ) and cyclosporin A ( CsA ) , partially inhibited apoptosis . These results demonstrate that enhancement of generation of ROS , DeltaPsim disruption and caspase activation may be involved in the apoptotic pathway induced by emodin .
We examined the influence of the level of dietary protein or vitamin E ( VE ) on oxidative damage to DNA , lipids , and protein in the liver after total body irradiation ( TBI ) with X-rays at 1 or 4 Gy . Levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine , thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances , and protein carbonyls in the liver did not differ among the groups that did not receive TBI . However , oxidative damage to lipids and protein was increased by TBI only in the 1% protein group . DNA damage , lipid peroxidation , or protein oxidation in the liver was increased by TBI in a dose-dependent manner , and the damage was consistently higher in the 1% than in the 20% protein group . In the 1% protein group , a greater decrease in relative spleen weight by TBI was also observed . Concentrations of antioxidants ( vitamins C and E and glutathione ) in the liver were lower and the concentration of nonheme iron in the liver was higher in the 1% than in the 20% protein group . Mice fed a 1% protein diet became susceptible to TBI-induced oxidative damage , and decreases in antioxidant levels and an increase in iron level were involved in the mechanism of this susceptibility . These results suggest that dietary VE and protein can prevent oxidative damage to DNA , lipid , and protein in mice subjected to TBI . Consumption of a VE-free diet significantly increased 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels in DNA from mice fed the 1% protein diet with TBI , but such changes were not detected in DNA from mice fed the 20% protein diet .
Inflammation which is an indispensable participant in tumor progression is intricately linked with redox modulation . The pro-inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNFalpha ) elevates reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . As both TNFalpha and oxidative stress independently play role in regulating cytoskeletal organization and cell survival pathways we investigated whether TNFalpha mediated oxidative stress regulates responses that offer survival advantages to glioblastoma cells . Treatment with TNFalpha elevated Akt phosphorylation in glioma cells . Increased in Akt phosphorylation was concurrent with the decrease in ROS scavenger SOD-1 levels . TNFalpha mediated increase in Akt phosphorylation was dependent on oxidative stress as Akt phosphorylation was abrogated in the presence of ROS inhibitor and elevated in cells transfected with SOD-1 siRNA . TNFalpha altered actin cytoskeletal organization and increased Cdc42 levels . This increase in Cdc42 was concomitant with its increased interaction with scaffold protein IQGAP-1 . Also , we report for the first time a ROS dependent interaction between pAkt and IQGAP-1 in TNFalpha treated cells . Importantly , Akt inhibition not only reversed TNFalpha mediated changes in actin cytoskeletal organization but also abrogated anchorage independent growth . Together , these results suggest that TNFalpha induced oxidative stress affects Akt activation to regulate actin organization and growth of glioma cells .
BACKGROUND Lung cancer often develops in association with chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases with an influx of neutrophils . More detailed information on inflammatory pathways and the role of neutrophils herein is a prerequisite for understanding the mechanism of inflammation associated cancer . METHODS In the present study , we used microarrays in order to obtain a global view of the transcriptional responses of the lung to LPS in mice , which mimics an acute lung inflammation . To investigate the influence of neutrophils in this process , we depleted mice from circulating neutrophils by treatment with anti-PMN antibodies prior to LPS exposure . RESULTS A total of 514 genes was greater than 1.5-fold differentially expressed in the LPS induced lung inflammation model. 394 of the 514 were up regulated genes mostly involved in cell cycle and immune/inflammation related processes , such as cytokine/chemokine activity and signalling . Down regulated genes represented nonimmune processes , such as development , metabolism and transport . Notably , the number of genes and pathways that were differentially expressed , was reduced when animals were depleted from circulating neutrophils , confirming the central role of neutrophils in the inflammatory response . Furthermore , there was a significant correlation between the differentially expressed gene list and the promutagenic DNA lesion M1dG , suggesting that it is the extent of the immune response which drives genetic instability in the inflamed lung . Several genes that were specifically regulated by the presence of activated neutrophils could be identified and these were mostly involved in interferon signalling , oxidative stress response and cell cycle progression . The latter possibly refers to a higher rate of cell turnover in the inflamed lung with neutrophils , suggesting that the neutrophil influx is associated with a higher risk for the accumulation and fixation of mutations . CONCLUSION Gene expression profiling identified specific genes and pathways that are related to neutrophilic inflammation and could be associated to cancer development and indicate an active role of neutrophils in mediating the LPS induced inflammatory response in the mouse lung .
BACKGROUND Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is associated with obesity , insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis . Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) is a serious consequence of NAFLD where chronic tissue damage and inflammation result in fibrosis which may progress to cirrhosis . Transforming growth factor beta1 ( TGFbeta1 ) , proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress are thought to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of these conditions . The contributions of individual liver cell types to fibrogenesis remain controversial and the influence of selenium status has not been investigated . METHODS In this study we have used a cell culture model of fat-loading using oleate-treated human hepatoblastoma ( C3A ) cells to investigate how fat-loading and selenium status might influence the production of collagen in response to TGFbeta1 . The secretion of inflammatory cytokines was also investigated , together with the epithelial character of the treated cells . RESULTS We found that in response to treatment with TGFbeta1 , C3A cells produced mRNA encoding the pro-alphaI chain of procollagen I , secreted procollagen I peptide , up-regulated production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) and the mesenchymal marker vimentin , and down-regulated albumin production . Most of these responses were considerably enhanced when cells were fat-loaded with oleate and were attenuated by selenium addition at a dose that optimised the expression of thioredoxin reductase and glutathione peroxidase . CONCLUSIONS Our data establish that both fat-loading and suboptimal selenium status enhance collagen and IL-8 production by C3A hepatocytes in response to TGFbeta1 , possibly as part of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition . GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE These findings suggest that the hepatocyte may be an important contributor to the pathogenesis of fibrosis associated with NAFLD .
Exposure to benzo[a]pyrene ( BaP ) can induce inflammatory skin diseases and skin cancer , which are both associated to oxidative stress . BaP is known to bind with high specificity to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) , modifying the expression of CYP1A1 , involved both in cancer and inflammation . While the current knowledge is based on murine skin and cell culture data , in this study human healthy skin has been treated with 5muM BaP in conditions simulating occupational and environmental exposure . AhR and CYP1A1 expression was evaluated by Western blotting , which revealed their presence even in control untreated skin ; both enzyme and receptor increased more than twofold after exposure to BaP . AhR expression level was lower than CYP1A1 in basal conditions and following induction . Oxidative stress was evaluated in terms of MTT reduction , protein peroxidation and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) formation . A significant increase in ROS and carbonyl compound production , as well as reduced tissue viability have been determined by BaP . The results of this experiment indicate that BaP , an AhR agonist , can significantly increase receptor and CYP1A1 expression and induce oxidative stress in human skin , confirming the involvement of this pathway in the pathogenesis of tissue damage due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .
Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol that exhibits pleiotropic health beneficial effects , including anti-inflammatory , cardio-protective , and cancer-protective activities . It is recognized as one of the more promising natural molecules in the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders . Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic , chronic inflammatory disease of the colon associated with a high colon cancer risk . Here , we used a dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) mouse model of colitis , which resembles human ulcerative colitis pathology . Resveratrol mixed in food ameliorates DSS-induced colitis in mice in a dose-dependent manner . Resveratrol significantly improves inflammation score , downregulates the percentage of neutrophils in the mesenteric lymph nodes and lamina propria , and modulates CD3(+) T cells that express tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IFN-gamma . Markers of inflammation and inflammatory stress ( p53 and p53-phospho-Ser(15) ) are also downregulated by resveratrol . Because chronic colitis drives colon cancer risk , we carried out experiments to determine the chemopreventive properties of resveratrol . Tumor incidence is reduced from 80% in mice treated with azoxymethane ( AOM ) + DSS to 20% in mice treated with AOM + DSS + resveratrol ( 300 ppm ) . Tumor multiplicity also decreased with resveratrol treatment . AOM + DSS-treated mice had 2.4 +/- 0.7 tumors per animal compared with AOM + DSS + 300 ppm resveratrol , which had 0.2 +/- 0.13 tumors per animal . The current study indicates that resveratrol is a useful , nontoxic complementary and alternative strategy to abate colitis and potentially colon cancer associated with colitis .
Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are key regulators of innate and acquired immunity . The maturation of DCs is directed by signal transduction events downstream of toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) and other pattern recognition receptors . Here , we demonstrate that , in mouse DCs , TLR agonists stimulate a profound metabolic transition to aerobic glycolysis , similar to the Warburg metabolism displayed by cancer cells . This metabolic switch depends on the phosphatidyl inositol 3'-kinase/Akt pathway , is antagonized by the adenosine monophosphate ( AMP)-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , and is required for DC maturation . The metabolic switch induced by DC activation is antagonized by the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 . Our data pinpoint TLR-mediated metabolic conversion as essential for DC maturation and function and reveal it as a potential target for intervention in the control of excessive inflammation and inappropriately regulated immune responses .
Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) and agonistic anti-DR4/TRAIL-R1 and anti-DR5/TRAIL-R2 antibodies are currently under clinical investigation for treatment of different malignancies . TRAIL activates DR4 and DR5 and thereby triggers apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling pathways , but possible different roles of DR4 or DR5 in these responses has poorly been addressed so far . In the present work , we analyzed cell viability , DISC formation as well as IL-8 and NF-kappaB activation side by side in responses to TRAIL and agonistic antibodies against DR4 ( mapatumumab ) and against DR5 ( lexatumumab ) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells . We found that all three reagents are able to activate cell death and pro-inflammatory signaling . Death-inducing signaling complex ( DISC ) analysis revealed that mapatumumab and lexatumumab induce formation of homocomplexes of either DR4 or DR5 , whereas TRAIL additionally stimulated the formation of heterocomplexes of both receptors . Notably , blocking of receptors using DR4- and DR5-specific Fab fragments indicated that TRAIL exerted its function predominantly via DR4 . Interestingly , inhibition of PKC by Goe6983 enabled DR5 to trigger apoptotic signaling in response to TRAIL and also strongly enhanced lexatumumab-mediated cell death . Our results suggest the existence of mechanisms that silence DR5 for TRAIL- but not for agonistic-antibody treatment .
Caveolin-1 ( -/- ) null stromal cells are a novel genetic model for cancer-associated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts . Here , we used an unbiased informatics analysis of transcriptional gene profiling to show that Cav-1 ( -/- ) bone-marrow derived stromal cells bear a striking resemblance to the activated tumor stroma of human breast cancers . More specifically , the transcriptional profiles of Cav-1 ( -/- ) stromal cells were most closely related to the primary tumor stroma of breast cancer patients that had undergone lymph-node ( LN ) metastasis . This is consistent with previous morphological data demonstrating that a loss of stromal Cav-1 protein ( by immuno-histochemical staining in the fibroblast compartment ) is significantly associated with increased LN-metastasis . We also provide evidence that the tumor stroma of human breast cancers shows a transcriptional shift towards oxidative stress , DNA damage/repair , inflammation , hypoxia , and aerobic glycolysis , consistent with the " Reverse Warburg Effect " . Finally , the tumor stroma of " metastasis-prone " breast cancer patients was most closely related to the transcriptional profiles derived from the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease . This suggests that certain fundamental biological processes are common to both an activated tumor stroma and neuro-degenerative stress . These processes may include oxidative stress , NO over-production ( peroxynitrite formation ) , inflammation , hypoxia , and mitochondrial dysfunction , which are thought to occur in Alzheimer?s disease pathology . Thus , a loss of Cav-1 expression in cancer-associated myofibroblasts may be a protein biomarker for oxidative stress , aerobic glycolysis , and inflammation , driving the " Reverse Warburg Effect " in the tumor micro-environment and cancer cell metastasis .
Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , one of the most frequent and deadliest cancers , has been increasing considerably in the United States . In the absence of a proven effective therapy for HCC , novel chemopreventive strategies are urgently needed to lower the current morbidity and mortality of HCC . Recently , we have reported that resveratrol , a compound present in grapes and red wine , significantly prevents diethylnitrosamine ( DENA)-induced liver tumorigenesis in rats , although the mechanism of action is not completely understood . In the present study , we have examined the underlying mechanisms of resveratrol chemoprevention of hepatocarcinogenesis by investigating the effects of resveratrol on oxidative damage and inflammatory markers during DENA-initiated rat liver carcinogenesis . There was a significant increase in hepatic lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in carcinogen control animals compared with their normal counterparts at the end of the study ( 20 weeks ) . Elevated expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase and 3-nitrotyrosine were noticed in the livers of the same animals . Dietary resveratrol ( 50-300 mg/kg ) administered throughout the study reversed all the aforementioned markers in a dose-responsive fashion in rats challenged with DENA . Resveratrol also elevated the protein and mRNA expression of hepatic nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) . Results of the present investigation provide evidence that attenuation of oxidative stress and suppression of inflammatory response mediated by Nrf2 could be implicated , at least in part , in the chemopreventive effects of this dietary agent against chemically induced hepatic tumorigenesis in rats . The outcome of this study may benefit the development of resveratrol in the prevention and intervention of human HCC .
OBJECTIVE To analyze the profiles of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , transforming growth factor-beta1 ( TGF-beta1 ) and interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) in serum and the tumor microenvironment ( cyst fluid , ascites ) in women with ovarian cancer or benign ovarian tumors to find the differences in their immunological status . We also estimated serum cytokines as biomarkers to distinguish preoperatively between malignant or benign character of tumors . DESIGN Prospective study . SETTING Tertiary referral hospital . POPULATION 51 women with epithelial ovarian cancer , 26 with benign ovarian tumors of epithelial origin and 21 healthy controls . METHODS The levels of cytokines were measured using ELISA sets . RESULTS We did not found differences in the levels of IFN-gamma , TNF-alpha and IL-2 in all fluids isolated from patients with malignant or benign tumors . Women with advanced cancer had significantly higher serum IL-6 , IL-10 and TGF-beta1 levels than women with early stages or benign tumors . Moreover , women with very advanced cancer in whom the optimal cytoreduction was disabled had the highest serum levels of IL-10 , TGF-beta1 and IL-8 . The concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were higher in ascites of cancer patients than in ascites of women with benign tumors . The areas under curves constructed for the selected cutoff serum cytokines levels ( AUC-ROC ) showed good predictive values for IL-6 ( 0.87 ) , IL-10 ( 0.836 ) and IL-8 ( 0.797 ) . CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate on intensified inflammatory process in women with ovarian cancer ( accompanied by their immunosuppression ) . Preoperative analysis of serum IL-6 , IL-10 and IL-8 may improve the differential diagnosis of ovarian tumors .
The authors examined nutritional risk factors for prostate cancer among 9,559 participants in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial ( United States and Canada , 1994-2003 ) . The presence or absence of cancer was determined by prostate biopsy , which was recommended during the trial because of an elevated prostate-specific antigen level or an abnormal digital rectal examination and was offered to all men at the trial's end . Nutrient intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and a structured supplement-use questionnaire . Cancer was detected in 1,703 men ; 127 cancers were high-grade ( Gleason score 8-10 ) . There were no associations of any nutrient or supplement with prostate cancer risk overall . Risk of high-grade cancer was associated with high intake of polyunsaturated fats ( quartile 4 vs. quartile 1 : odds ratio = 2.41 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 1.33 , 4.38 ) . Dietary calcium was positively associated with low-grade cancer but inversely associated with high-grade cancer ( for quartile 4 vs. quartile 1 , odds ratios were 1.27 ( 95% CI : 1.02 , 1.57 ) and 0.43 ( 95% CI : 0.21 , 0.89 ) , respectively ) . Neither dietary nor supplemental intakes of nutrients often suggested for prostate cancer prevention , including lycopene , long-chain n-3 fatty acids , vitamin D , vitamin E , and selenium , were significantly associated with cancer risk . High intake of n-6 fatty acids , through their effects on inflammation and oxidative stress , may increase prostate cancer risk .
n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) have a chemopreventive effect while n-6 PUFA promote carcinogenesis . The effect of these essential fatty acids may be related to oxidative stress . Therefore , the study was designed to evaluate the effect of different ratios of fish oil ( FO ) and corn oil ( CO ) in the prevention of colon cancer . Male Wistar rats were divided into control , dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride ( DMH ) treated , FO + CO ( 1:1 ) and FO + CO ( 2.5:1 ) . All the groups , except the control received a weekly injection of DMH for 4 weeks . The animals were sacrificed either 48 h later ( initiation phase ) or kept for 16 weeks ( post initiation phase ) . DMH treatment in the initiation phase animals showed mild to moderate inflammation , decreased ROS and TrxR activity , increased antioxidants , apoptosis and ACF multiplicity . The post initiation study showed severe inflammation with hyperplasia , increased ACF multiplicity and ROS levels , a decrease in antioxidants and apoptosis . The FO + CO ( 1:1 ) treated animals showed severe inflammation , a decrease in ROS , an increase in antioxidants and apoptosis in the initiation phase . FO + CO ( 1:1 ) in the post initiation phase and FO + CO ( 2.5:1 ) in the initiation showed mild inflammation , increased ROS , apoptosis and decreased antioxidants . There was a decrease in ACF multiplicity and ROS levels , increased antioxidants and apoptosis in the post initiation phase study . The present study suggests that FO has a dose- and time-dependent chemopreventive effect in colon cancer mediated through oxidative stress and apoptosis .
BACKGROUND Cisplatin chemotherapy often causes acute kidney injury in cancer patients . The causative mechanisms of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury include renal inflammation , activation of p53 tumour suppressor protein and tubular apoptosis . Luteolin , a flavone found in medicinal herbs and plants , has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory , antioxidant and anticarcinogenic activities . The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-apoptotic effect of luteolin on cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury and the molecular mechanism . METHODS C57BL/6 mice were treated with cisplatin ( 20 mg/kg ) with or without treatment with luteolin ( 50 mg/kg for 3 days ) . Renal function , histological changes , degree of oxidative stress and tubular apoptosis were examined . The effects of luteolin on cisplatin-induced expression of renal p53 , PUMA-alpha and Bcl-2 family proteins were evaluated . RESULTS Treatment of mice with cisplatin resulted in renal damage , showing an increase in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels , tubular damage , oxidative stress and apoptosis . Treatment of cisplatin-treated mice with luteolin significantly improved renal dysfunction , reducing tubular cell damage , oxidative stress and apoptosis . Examination of molecules involving apoptosis of the kidney revealed that treatment of cisplatin increased the levels of p53 and its phosphorylation , PUMA-alpha , Bax and caspase-3 activity that were significantly decreased by treatment with luteolin . CONCLUSION These results indicate that cisplatin induces acute kidney injury by regulation of p53-dependent renal tubular apoptosis and that luteolin ameliorates the cisplatin-mediated nephrotoxicity through down-regulation of p53-dependent apoptotic pathway in the kidney .
Cetuximab is a chimeric antibody registered for the therapy of advanced colorectal carcinoma . Cancer and anticancer therapy are associated with oxidative stress , and disorders of antioxidant balance may be involved in the toxicity associated with anticancer treatment . The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes of serum retinol , alpha-tocopherol and C-reactive protein during the first month of treatment with cetuximab and chemotherapy . Twenty-five consecutive patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with a combination of chemotherapy and cetuximab were included in the present study . Serum retinol and alpha-tocopherol were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and serum C-reactive protein was determined using commercial kits . Significant correlation was observed between baseline concentrations of retinol and C-reactive protein ( r(s)=-0.54 , p<0.01 ) . Median survival of patients who had baseline serum retinol below 1.25 micromol/L was 10 mo compared to 18 mo for patients who had serum retinol equal or above 1.25 micromol/L ( p<0.05 ) ; median survival of patients who had serum C-reactive protein below 24 mg/L was significantly longer compared to patients with C-reactive protein levels equal or above 24 mg/L ( 18 vs. 7 mo , p<0.05 ) , but no difference in survival was observed based on alpha-tocopherol levels . Twenty-two patients had evaluation of retinol , alpha-tocopherol and C-reactive protein at least once during the follow up . Serum concentration of alpha-tocopherol decreased significantly during the therapy , but retinol and C-reactive protein concentrations remained unchanged . In conclusion , a significant correlation was observed between serum retinol and C-reactive protein . Serum alpha-tocopherol decreased significantly during the first month of combination therapy with cetuximab . Low retinol and high C-reactive protein concentrations were predictive of poor prognosis in this patient population .
Diallyl disulfide ( DADS ) is a major organo-sulfur compound derived from garlic ( Allium sativum ) , which inhibits the proliferation of various types of cancer cells . In this study we investigated the effect of DADS on the induction of apoptosis , as well as its regulatory effect on the activation of transcription factors in B16F-10 melanoma cells . Treatment of B16F-10 cells with nontoxic concentrations of DADS resulted in the presence of apoptotic bodies and induced DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner . Cell-cycle analysis revealed that the occurrence of the sub-G1 peak was significantly elevated in DADS-treated cells . DADS treatment also down-reguated Bcl-2 expression and up-regulated p53 , caspase-9 , and caspase-3 expression in B16F-10 melanoma cells . The study also reveals that DADS inhibited the activation and nuclear translocation of p65 , p50 , and c-Rel subunits of nuclear factor ( NF)-B and other transcription factors , such as c-fos , activated transcription factor-2 , and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein , in B16F-10 melanoma cells The pro-inflammatory cytokine production and gene expression of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)-alpha , interleukin ( IL)-1beta , IL-6 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) were down-regulated in DADS-treated cells compared with control B16F-10 metastatic melanoma cells . DADS induces caspase-dependent apoptosis through a mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway in B16F-10 melanoma cells by activating p53 and caspase-3 gene expression and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-B-mediated Bcl-2 activation .
Accumulating evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that chronic inflammation and oxidative stress play critical roles in neoplastic development . The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidative stress activities , and differential regulation of Nrf2-mediated genes by tea Chrysanthemum zawadskii ( CZ ) and licorice Glycyrrhiza uralensis ( LE ) extracts . The anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress activities of hexane/ethanol extracts of CZ and LE were investigated using in vitro and in vivo approaches , including quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR ) and microarray . Additionally , the role of the transcriptional factor Nrf2 ( nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 ) signaling pathways was examined . Our results show that CZ and LE extracts exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activities by suppressing the mRNA and protein expression levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers IL-1beta , IL-6 , COX-2 and iNOS in LPS-stimulated murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells . CZ and LE also significantly suppressed the NO production of LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells . Additionally , CZ and LE suppressed the NF-kappaB luciferase activity in human HT-29 colon cancer cells . Both extracts also showed strong Nrf2-mediated antioxidant/Phase II detoxifying enzymes induction . CZ and LE induced NQO1 , Nrf2 , and UGT and antioxidant response element ( ARE)-luciferase activity in human hepatoma HepG2 C8 cells . Using Nrf2 knockout [ Nrf2 ( -/-) ] and Nrf2 wild-type ( +/+ ) mice , LE and CZ showed Nrf2-dependent transactivation of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant and phase II detoxifying genes . In summary , CZ and LE possess strong inhibitory effects against NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory as well as strong activation of the Nrf2-ARE-anti-oxidative stress signaling pathways , which would contribute to their overall health promoting pharmacological effects against diseases including cancer .
PTEN , a phosphoinositide-3-phosphatase , serves dual roles as a tumor suppressor and regulator of cellular anabolic/catabolic metabolism . Adaptation of a redox-sensitive cysteinyl thiol in PTEN for signal transduction by hydrogen peroxide may have superimposed a vulnerability to other mediators of oxidative stress and inflammation , especially reactive carbonyl species , which are commonly occurring by-products of arachidonic acid peroxidation . Using MCF7 and HEK-293 cells , we report that several reactive aldehydes and ketones , e.g. electrophilic alpha,beta-enals ( acrolein , 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal ) and alpha,beta-enones ( prostaglandin A(2) , Delta12-prostaglandin J(2) and 15-deoxy-Delta-12,14-prostaglandin J(2) ) covalently modify and inactivate cellular PTEN , with ensuing activation of PKB/Akt kinase ; phosphorylation of Akt substrates ; increased cell proliferation ; and increased nuclear beta-catenin signaling . Alkylation of PTEN by alpha,beta-enals/enones and interference with its restraint of cellular PKB/Akt signaling may accentuate hyperplastic and neoplastic disorders associated with chronic inflammation , oxidative stress , or aging .
INTRODUCTION Clinical and experimental studies indicate oxygen free radicals and their reactive derivatives participation in formation of chronic inflammation states , which facilitate gastrointestinal tract tumors development . During malignant changes formation in epithelium of gastrointestinal tract increased oxygen radicals generation initiates lipid peroxidation and DNA and proteins oxidation processes . Final lipid peroxidation products ( saturated and unsaturated aldehydes ) are highly reactive and characterized by greatly longer half life time than reactive oxygen species and capability to diffuse from places of their formation to distant cell areas . In cells they react with important biological macromolecules such as DNA and proteins causing their structural and functional damages . The effects of changes in cell membranes structure are increase in their permeability , depolarization , decrease of hydrophobicity and inhibition of enzymes , membrane channels and transporters . These changes lead to the loss of cell integrity . STUDY AIM Determination of lipid peroxidation level in blood serum patients with gastrointestinal tract tumors . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials for studies were obtained from 170 patients with gastrointestinal tract tumors : 10 with stomach cancer , 20 with pancreatic cancer , 30 with primary liver cancer , 60 with primary colorectal cancer and 50 with metachronic colorectal cancer liver metastases . Blood was taken from patients 1 day before and 6 days after surgery . Control blood was obtained from 53 healthy blood donors . Lipid peroxidation level was determined spectrophotometrically as a concentration of final lipid peroxidation products , which in reaction with tiobarbituric acid ( TBA ) form colour complex ( thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances , TBARS ) . RESULTS Higher lipid peroxidation level was observed in pre- and postoperative blood sera patients with gastrointestinal tumors in comparison to serum from healthy blood donors . CONCLUSIONS Increased lipid peroxidation level in peripheral blood of patients with gastrointestinal tract tumors is evidence of intensive oxidative stress and might indicate impairment of antioxidant defense mechanisms in organism .
Carbon nanotubes have a wide range of applications in various industries and their use is likely to rise in the future . Currently , a major concern is that with the increasing use and production of these materials , there may be increased health risks to exposed workers . Long ( > 15 microm ) straight nanotubes may undergo frustrated phagocytosis which is likely to result in reduced clearance . We examine here the effects of multiwalled carbon nanotubes of different sizes on monocytic THP-1 cells , with regard to their ability to stimulate increased expression of the HO-1 and GST genes and their ability to produce nuclear translocation of the transcription factor , Nrf2 , as well as the release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators of inflammation . Our results suggest that long ( 50 microm ) carbon nanotubes ( 62.5 microg/ml for 4 hours ) produce increased nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and increased HO-1 gene expression compared with shorter entangled nanotubes . There was no increased gene expression for GST . The long nanotubes ( NT1 ) caused increased release of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta , an effect which was diminished by the antioxidant trolox , suggesting a role of oxidative stress in the upregulation of this cytokine . Tentatively , our study suggests that long carbon nanotubes may exert their effect in THP-1 cells in part via an oxidative stress mechanism .
Cigarette smoke ( CS ) is a rich source of radicals , predisposing the cell to oxidative stress resulting in inflammation . Chronic inflammation is a recognized risk factor for carcinogenesis . Cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) is a mediator of inflammatory pathway and may , therefore , contribute to carcinogenesis . There are several reports that suggest the association between CS and COX-2 associated risk to cancer . In the present study , we examined the role of celecoxib ( a selective COX-2 inhibitor ) in modulating the oxidative stress caused by CS inhalation in mice . CS exposure for a period of 10 weeks caused oxidative stress in the pulmonary and hepatic tissues , as evident from the increase in lipid peroxidation levels ( LPO ) and decrease in reduced glutathione ( GSH ) levels . Celecoxib ( 125 mg/kg body weight for 8 weeks ) administration to CS inhaling mice reduced the oxidative stress by decreasing the LPO levels and enhancing the GSH levels in comparison to the CS-exposed group . CS exposure repressed the enzymatic antioxidant defense system , as evident from the decrease in catalase ( CAT ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activities . Co-adminstration of celecoxib considerably reversed the changes in the enzymatic antioxidant defense system . Histopathological studies of lungs showed that CS exposure induced alveolar wall destruction and air space enlargement . In co-treated group , the alveolar septa were thicker than normal with apparent infiltration of inflammatory cells . In CS-exposed group , hepatic tissue exhibited vacuolization and macrophage infiltration . Co-treatment with celecoxib restored the normal histoarchitechture in hepatic tissues of CS inhaling mice . Thus , the present study demonstrated that celecoxib adminstration reduced the oxidative stress-mediated risk to carcinogenesis , due to its ability to boost the antioxidant defense system .
D-Limonene , a common monoterepene has been shown to have antiproliferative , apoptosis-inducing and chemopreventive effects . In the present study , we have investigated the effects of D-limonene on the growth of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene ( DMBA)-initiated and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-promoted skin tumor development . We found that D-limonene ( 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight ) treatments to the mouse skin significantly reduced the TPA-induced ( a ) edema and hyperplasia ( p < 0.001 ) ; ( b ) expression of cyclooxygenase-2 ; ( c ) ornithine decarboxylase activity ( p < 0.001 ) ; and ( d ) [ (3)H ] thymidine incorporation into DNA ( p < 0.001 ) . In addition , treatment of D-limonene effectively restored the level of reduced glutathione , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione reductase , glutathione S-transferase , catalase and malondialdehyde production in TPA-treated mouse skin . In a two-stage skin tumorigenesis study , D-limonene significantly reduced the tumor burden ( p < 0.005 ) and tumor incidence as compared to DMBA/TPA-treated mice . D-Limonene treatment also extended the latency period of tumor development from 4 to 9 weeks . D-Limonene treatment decreased the expression level of Ras , Raf and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 in DMBA/TPA-induced tumors . A decrease in the expression of Bcl-2 and an increase in Bax expression were also observed in tumor tissues of mice treated with D-limonene . Taken together , our findings suggest that D-limonene may exert its chemopreventive activity through the inhibition of inflammation , oxidative stress and Ras-signaling as well as the induction of pro-apoptotic state during TPA-mediated promotion of DMBA-induced skin cancer in mouse model .
Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose through aerobic glycolysis . This phenomenon , known as the Warburg effect , is an anomalous characteristic of glucose metabolism in cancer cells . Chronic inflammation is a key promoting factor of tumourigenesis . It remains , however , largely unexplored whether and how pro-tumourigenic inflammation regulates glucose metabolism in cancer cells . Here , we show that pro-inflammatory cytokines promote glycolysis in breast cancer cells , and that the inflammation-induced miR-155 functions as an important mediator in this process . We further show that miR-155 acts to upregulate hexokinase 2 ( hk2 ) , through two distinct mechanisms . First , miR-155 promotes hk2 transcription by activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) , a transcriptional activator for hk2 . Second , via targeting C/EBP\u03b2 ( a transcriptional activator for mir-143 ) , miR-155 represses mir-143 , a negative regulator of hk2 , thus resulting in upregulation of hk2 expression at the post-transcriptional level . The miR-155-mediated hk2 upregulation also appears to operate in other types of cancer cells examined . We suggest that the miR-155/miR-143/HK2 axis may represent a common mechanism linking inflammation to the altered metabolism in cancer cells .
Partial or whole-brain irradiation is often required to treat both primary and metastatic brain cancer . Radiation-induced normal tissue injury , including progressive cognitive impairment , however , can significantly affect the well-being of the approximately 200,000 patients who receive these treatments each year in the United States . Although the exact mechanisms underlying radiation-induced late effects remain unclear , oxidative stress and inflammation are thought to play a critical role . Microglia are key mediators of neuroinflammation . Peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) delta has been shown to be a potent regulator of anti-inflammatory responses . Thus , we hypothesized that PPARdelta activation would modulate the radiation-induced inflammatory response in microglia . Incubating BV-2 murine microglial cells with the PPARdelta agonist L-165041 prevented the radiation-induced increase in : ( i ) intracellular reactive oxygen species generation , ( ii ) Cox-2 and MCP-1 expression , and ( iii ) IL-1beta and TNF-alpha message levels . This occurred , in part , through PPARdelta-mediated modulation of stress-activated kinases and proinflammatory transcription factors . PPARdelta inhibited NF-kappaB via transrepression by physically interacting with the p65 subunit and prevented activation of the PKCalpha/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/AP-1 pathway by inhibiting the radiation-induced increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species generation . These data support the hypothesis that PPARdelta activation can modulate radiation-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in microglia .
OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of CdTe QDs ( cadmium telluride quantum dots ) on oxidative stress and DNA damage of liver cells in mice . METHODS Thirty ICR male mice were randomly divided into 5 groups : one negative control ( normal saline ) group . Three CdTe QDs groups ( exposed by intravenous injection of 0.2 ml of CdTe QDs at the concentration of 3.75 , 37.5 and 375 nmol/ml respectively ) for electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) test , and another positive control group ( exposed by intravenous injection of 0.2 ml of cyclophosphamide 20 mg/ml ) for single cell gel electrophoresis ( SCGE ) test . All mice were decapitated 24h after the injection , free radicals and DNA damage of liver cells were detected by EPR and SCGE . RESULTS The levels of oxygen free radicals detected by EPR were increased with the increase of CdTe QDs . The tail length , olive tail moment , tail DNA ( % ) and the ratio of tail/head examined by SCGE were also increased with the increase of the dosage of CdTe QDs ( P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSION CdTe QDs could induce oxidative stress and DNA damage of liver cells in mice with a dose-effect relationship .
The therapeutic principle of allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation ( allo-HCT ) is based on an active donor immune system that eliminates host-derived tumour cells . We hypothesized that in addition to the alloantigen-driven anti-tumour response , disruption of the immunological microenvironment within the tumour is responsible for its elimination after allo-HCT . We observed that induction of graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) significantly reduced the abundance of luc(+) FoxP3(+) regulatory T ( Treg ) cells in the tumour tissue , which is indicative of impaired or over-ridden tumour recruitment signals towards Treg cells . Analysis of the intestines and liver revealed chemokines and purine nucleotides as candidates for attracting Treg to these sites of inflammation . Despite its expression on tissue-residing Treg cells , the chemokine receptor CCR3 was not critical for Treg-cell function following allo-HCT . Extracellular ATP can attract immune cells via P2Y2 . P2Y2 was found to be expressed on Treg cells , and we found a partial reduction of GvHD prevention when P2Y2(-/-) rather than P2Y2(+/+) Treg cells were given . Exogenous local inflammation reduced Treg-cell accumulation in the tumour , suggesting a potential clinical approach to prevent Treg-cell-mediated tumour escape . In conclusion , we demonstrate that GvHD-related inflammation reduced Treg-cell numbers at the tumour sites , which may in turn help to explain the observation that patients with GvHD have a lower risk of tumour relapse .
IFN-gamma is a master regulator of the immune responses that occur in the transplanted kidney , acting both on the immune system and on the graft itself . The cellular responses to IFN-gamma are complex , and emerging evidence suggests that IFN-gamma may regulate autophagic functions . Conversely , autophagy modulates innate and adaptive immune functions in various contexts . In this study , we identify a novel mechanism by which IFN-gamma activates autophagy in human kidney epithelial cells and provide new insights into how autophagy regulates immune functions in response to IFN-gamma . Our results indicate that IFN-gamma promotes tryptophan depletion , activates the eIF2alpha kinase general control nonderepressible-2 ( GCN2 ) , and leads to an increase in the autophagic flux . Further , tryptophan supplementation and RNA interference directed against GCN2 inhibited IFN-gamma-induced autophagy . This process is of functional relevance because autophagy regulates the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors by human kidney epithelial cells in response to IFN-gamma . These findings assign to IFN-gamma a novel function in the regulation of autophagy , which , in turn , modulates IFN-gamma-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines .
Cellular senescence has emerged as a critical tumor suppressive mechanism in recent years , but relatively little is known about how senescence occurs . Here , we report that secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 ( SFRP1 ) , a secreted antagonist of Wnt signaling , is oversecreted upon cellular senescence caused by DNA damage or oxidative stress . SFRP1 is necessary for stress-induced senescence caused by these factors and is sufficient for the induction of senescence phenotypes . We present evidence suggesting that SFRP1 functions as a secreted mediator of senescence through inhibition of Wnt signaling and activation of the retinoblastoma ( Rb ) pathway and that cancer-associated SFRP1 mutants are defective for senescence induction .
The suppression of MAPK and oxidative stress could be an important anti-inflammatory mechanism . Fucoidan regulates MAPK activity in several cell lines . However , the mechanism for the anti-inflammatory and oxidative stress effect of low molecular weight fucoidan ( LMWF ) is poorly understood in RAW264.7 cells . The objective of this study was to examine the critical role of LMWF during LPS-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells . To determine the potential role of LMWF , we analysed pro-inflammatory cytokine , transcription factor , inflammation-related and oxidative stress related protein expression in vitro during LPS-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells . In this study , we demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of LMWF on LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages through the regulation of signalling pathways , including its effect on the attenuation of inflammatory cytokines , such as IL-1beta , IL-1 and TNF-alpha , and the degradation of phosphorylated p38 MAPK , ERK1/2 and JNK . This study also demonstrates that LMWF might block NO as well as the expression of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which subsequently inhibits the iNOS and COX-2 expression induced by LPS . Based on these findings , we suggest that LMWF might have great potential as an external pathogen prevention and intervention agent for inflammatory diseases .
Inorganic arsenic in the drinking water is a multisite human carcinogen that potentially targets the kidney . Recent evidence also indicates that developmental arsenic exposure impacts renal carcinogenesis in humans and mice . Emerging theory indicates that cancer may be a disease of stem cells ( SCs ) and that there are abundant active SCs during early life . Therefore , we hypothesized that inorganic arsenic targets SCs , or partially differentiated progenitor cells ( PCs ) , for oncogenic transformation . Thus , a rat kidney SC/PC cell line , RIMM-18 , was chronically exposed to low-level arsenite ( 500 nM ) for up to 28 weeks . Multiple markers of acquired cancer phenotype were assessed biweekly during arsenic exposure , including secreted matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activity , proliferation rate , colony formation in soft agar , and cellular invasiveness . Arsenic exposure by 10 weeks and after also induced marked and sustained increases in colony formation , indicative of the loss of contact inhibition , and increased invasiveness , both cancer cell characteristics . Compared to the passage-matched control , chronic arsenic exposure caused exposure-duration dependent increases in secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity , Cox-2 expression , and more rapid proliferation ( all >2-fold ) , characteristics typical of cancer cells . Dysregulation of SC maintenance genes and signaling pathways are common during oncogenesis . During arsenite exposure , expression of several genes associated with normal kidney development and SC regulation and differentiation ( i.e. , Wt-1 , Wnt-4 , Bmp-7 , etc. ) were aberrantly altered . Arsenic-exposed renal SCs produced more nonadherent spheroid bodies that grew much more aggressively in Matrigel , typical of cancer SCs ( CSCs ) . The transformed cells also showed gene overexpression typical of renal SCs/CSCs ( CD24 , Osr1 , Ncam ) and arsenic adaptation such as overexpression of Mt-1 , Mt2 , Sod-1 , and Abcc2 . These data suggest that inorganic arsenic induced an acquired cancer phenotype in vitro in these rat kidney SCs potentially forming CSCs and , consistent with data in vivo , indicate that these multipotent SCs may be targets of arsenic during renal carcinogenesis .
We previously demonstrated that downregulation of protein kinase CKII induces cellular senescence in human colon cancer HCT116 cells . To investigate the role of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) in CKII downregulation during senescence , we employed computational algorithms . Four miRNAs ( miR-186 , miR-216b , miR-337-3p , and miR-760 ) were predicted to be miRNAs against CKIIalpha mRNA . Mimics of all four miRNAs jointly downregulated CKIIalpha expression in HCT116 cells . Reporter analysis and RT-PCR have suggested that these four miRNAs may stimulate degradation of CKIIalpha mRNA by targeting its 3 ' untranslated regions ( UTRs ) . The four miRNA mimics increased senescent-associated beta-galactosidase ( SA-beta-gal ) staining , p53 and p21(Cip1/WAF1) expression , and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production . In contrast , concomitant knockdown of the four miRNAs by antisense inhibitors increased the CKIIalpha protein level and suppressed CKII inhibition-mediated senescence . Finally , CKIIalpha overexpression antagonized senescence induced by the four miRNA mimics . Therefore , the present results show that miR-186 , miR-216b , miR-337-3p , and miR-760 cooperatively promote cellular senescence through the p53-p21(Cip1/WAF1) pathway by CKII downregulation-mediated ROS production in HCT116 cells .
Kinins and their receptors have been recently implicated in cancer . Using functional and molecular approaches , we investigated the relevance of kinin B(1) and B(2) receptors in bladder cancer . Functional studies were conducted using bladder cancer cell lines , and human biopsies were employed for molecular studies . Both B(1) des-Arg(9)-BK and B(2) BK receptor agonists stimulated the proliferation of grade 3-derived T24 bladder cancer cells . Furthermore , treatment with B(1) and B(2) receptor antagonists ( SSR240612 and HOE140 ) markedly inhibited the proliferation of T24 cells . Only higher concentrations of BK increased the proliferation of the grade 1 bladder cancer cell line RT4 , while des-Arg(9)-BK completely failed to induce its proliferation . Real-time PCR revealed that the mRNA expression of kinin receptors , particularly B(1) receptors , was increased in T24 cells relative to RT4 cells . Data from bladder cancer human biopsies revealed that B(1) receptor expression was increased in all tumor samples and under conditions of chronic inflammation . We also show novel evidence demonstrating that the pharmacological inhibition of PI3Kgamma ( phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ) with AS252424 , concentration-dependently reduced T24 cell proliferation induced by BK or des-Arg(9)-BK . Finally , the incubation of T24 cells with kinin agonists led to a marked activation of the PI3K/AKT and ERK 1/2 signaling pathways , whereas p38 MAP kinase remained unaffected . Kinin receptors , especially B(1) receptors , appear to be implicated in bladder cancer progression . It is tempting to suggest that selective kinin antagonists might represent potential alternative therapies for bladder cancer .
The ARF locus is frequently inactivated in human cancer . The oncosuppressor ARF has indeed been described as a general sensor for different situation of cellular stress . We have previously demonstrated that ARF deficiency severely impairs inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo , establishing a role for ARF in the regulation of innate immunity . The aim of the present work was to get further insights into the immune functions of ARF and to evaluate its possible contribution to the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 or M2 phenotype . Our results demonstrate that resting Arf(-/-) macrophages express high levels of Ym1 and Fizz-1 , two typical markers of alternatively-activated macrophages ( M2 ) . Additionally , Arf(-/-) peritoneal macrophages showed an impaired response to lipopolysaccharide ( a classical inducer of M1 polaryzation ) and a reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines . Moreover , upon stimulation with interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) , an inducer of the M2 phenotype , well established M2 markers such as Fizz-1 , Ym1 and arginase-1 were upregulated in Arf(-/-) as compared with wild type macrophages . Accordingly , the cytokine and chemokine profile associated with the M2 phenotype was significantly overexpressed in Arf(-/-) macrophages responding to IL-4 . In addition , multiple pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF and MMP-9 were also increased . In summary , these results indicate that ARF contributes to the polarization and functional plasticity of macrophages .
Androgens regulate both the physiological development of the prostate and the pathology of prostatic diseases . However , the mechanisms by which androgens exert their regulatory activities on these processes are poorly understood . In this study , we have determined that androgens regulate overall cell metabolism and cell growth , in part , by increasing autophagy in prostate cancer cells . Importantly , inhibition of autophagy using either pharmacological or molecular inhibitors significantly abrogated androgen-induced prostate cancer cell growth . Mechanistically , androgen-mediated autophagy appears to promote cell growth by augmenting intracellular lipid accumulation , an effect previously demonstrated to be necessary for prostate cancer cell growth . Further , autophagy and subsequent cell growth is potentiated , in part , by androgen-mediated increases in reactive oxygen species . These findings demonstrate a role for increased fat metabolism and autophagy in prostatic neoplasias and highlight the potential of targeting underexplored metabolic pathways for the development of novel therapeutics .
Inflammation is a major risk factor for carcinogenesis in patients affected by chronic colitis , yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression from chronic inflammation to cancer are not completely understood . Activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4)-NFkappaB signaling axis is associated with inflammation . Thus , we hypothesized that inhibition of TLR4-NFkappaB signaling might help in limiting inflammatory responses and inflammation-induced oncogenesis . In this work , we studied the effects of a TLR4-interacting surfactant protein A-derived ( SPA4 ) peptide on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)-induced TLR4-NFkappaB signaling and cancer progression . We first characterized this peptide for its ability to bind the TLR4 ligand-LPS and for physico-chemical characteristics . Inflammation was induced by challenging the colon cancer SW480 cells with Escherichia coli LPS . Cells were then treated with varying amounts of the SPA4 peptide . Changes in the expression of TLR4 , interleukin ( IL)-1beta and IL-6 , in intracellular NFkappaB-related signal transducers ( IKBalpha , p65 , phosphorylated IKBalpha , phosphorylated p65 , RelB , COX-2 ) as well as in the transcriptional activity of NFkappaB were studied by immunocytochemistry , immunoblotting and NFkappaB reporter assay , respectively . Simultaneously , the effects on LPS-induced cell migration and invasion were determined . We found that the SPA4 peptide does not bind to LPS . Rather , its binding to TLR4 inhibits the LPS-induced phosphorylation of p65 , production of IL-1beta and IL-6 , activity of NFkappaB , migration and invasion of SW480 cells . In conclusion , our results suggest that the inhibition of TLR4-NFkappaB signaling by a TLR4-binding peptide may help for the treatment of chronic inflammation and prevention of inflammation-induced cancer in patients with colitis .
Most hepatocellular carcinomas ( HCC ) develop in the context of severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis caused by chronic liver inflammation , which also results in accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . In this study , we examined whether the stress-activated protein kinase p38alpha ( Mapk14 ) controls ROS metabolism and development of fibrosis and cancer in mice given thioacetamide to induce chronic liver injury . Liver-specific p38alpha ablation was found to enhance ROS accumulation , which appears to be exerted through the reduced expression of antioxidant protein HSP25 ( Hspb1 ) , a mouse homolog of HSP27 . Its reexpression in p38alpha-deficient liver prevents ROS accumulation and thioacetamide-induced fibrosis. p38alpha deficiency increased expression of SOX2 , a marker for cancer stem cells and the liver oncoproteins c-Jun ( Jun ) and Gankyrin ( Psmd10 ) and led to enhanced thioacetamide-induced hepatocarcinogenesis . The upregulation of SOX2 and c-Jun was prevented by administration of the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole . Intriguingly , the risk of human HCC recurrence is positively correlated with ROS accumulation in liver . Thus , p38alpha and its target HSP25/HSP27 appear to play a conserved and critical hepatoprotective function by curtailing ROS accumulation in liver parenchymal cells engaged in oxidative metabolism of exogenous chemicals . Augmented oxidative stress of liver parenchymal cells may explain the close relationship between liver fibrosis and hepatocarcinogenesis .
Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) is a major form of chronic inflammation that can frequently progress to colon cancer . Several studies have demonstrated massive infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lamina propria and submucosa in the progression of UC-associated colon carcinogenesis . Macrophages contribute to the development of colitis-associated colon cancer ( CAC ) . However , the role of neutrophils is not well understood . To better understand the involvement of tumor-associated neutrophils ( TANs ) in the regulation of CAC , we used a mouse CAC model produced by administering azoxymethane ( AOM ) , followed by repeated dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) ingestion . This causes severe colonic inflammation and subsequent development of multiple tumors in mice colon . We observed that colorectal mucosal inflammation became increasingly severe with AOM and DSS treatment . Macrophages infiltrated the lamina propria and submucosa , together with a marked increase in neutrophil infiltration . The chemokine CXCL2 increased in the lamina propria and submucosal regions of the colons of the treated mice , together with the infiltration of neutrophils expressing CXCR2 , a specific receptor for CXCL2 . This process was followed by neoplastic transformation . After AOM and DSS treatment , the mice showed enhanced production of metalloproteinase ( MMP)-9 and neutrophil elastase ( NE ) , accompanied by excessive vessel generation and cell proliferation . Moreover , CXCL2 promoted neutrophil recruitment and induced neutrophils to express MMP-9 and NE in vitro . Furthermore , administration of neutrophil-neutralizing antibodies after the last DSS cycle markedly reduced the number and size of tumors and decreased the expression of CXCR2 , CXCL2 , MMP-9 , and NE . These observations indicate a crucial role for TANs in the initiation and progression of CAC and suggest that the CXCL2-CXCR2 axis might be useful in reducing the risk of UC-associated colon cancer .
SMG1 is a member of the phosphoinositide kinase-like kinase family of proteins that includes ATM , ATR , and DNA-PK , proteins with known roles in DNA damage and cellular stress responses . SMG1 has a well-characterized role in nonsense-mediated decay as well as suggested roles in the DNA damage response , resistance to oxidative stress , regulation of hypoxic responses , and apoptosis . To understand the roles of SMG1 further , we generated a Genetrap Smg1 mouse model . Smg1 homozygous KO mice were early embryonic lethal , but Smg1 heterozygous mice showed a predisposition to a range of cancers , particularly lung and hematopoietic malignancies , as well as development of chronic inflammation . These mice did not display deficiencies in known roles of SMG1 , including nonsense-mediated decay . However , they showed elevated basal tissue and serum cytokine levels , indicating low-level inflammation before the development of tumors . Smg1 heterozygous mice also showed evidence of oxidative damage in tissues . These data suggest that the inflammation observed in Smg1 haploinsufficiency contributes to susceptibility to cancer and that Smg1-deficient animals represent a model of inflammation-enhanced cancer development .
Prostate cancer is responsible for major deaths globally after lung cancer . However , etiology of prostate cancer is still unknown . Individual risk and incidence of prostate cancer may result from the interaction of genetic susceptibility with exposure to environmental factors such as infectious agents , tobacco , occupational exposure , dietary carcinogens , and/or hormonal imbalances leading to injury of the prostate and to the development of chronic inflammation . About 30% of all human cancers are caused by tobacco smoking and inhaled pollutants . Inflammation is now regarded as an important hallmark of cancer . The present study has been aimed to explore the pro-inflammatory levels in prostate carcinoma patients by examining the serum levels of novel cytokine interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) expression in tobacco exposed population . A total of 578 ( n = 284 biopsy proven prostate cancer patients , n = 294 controls with and without tobacco exposed population ) were recruited . Serum IL-18 ( Interleukin-18 ) level was done by ELISA . The IL-18 levels between cancer patients and controls within same mode tobacco exposure as tobacco smoking ( overall ) showed significant difference ( P < 0.0001 ) and further we compared within stratified group , it significantly differ ( P < 0.0001 ) in bidi and cigarette smoking than control non users . Furthermore , IL-18 levels in tobacco chewers ( overall ) with gutkha and khaini chewers showed significant difference ( P < 0.01 ) than controls non users . Moreover , the IL-18 levels between cancer patients and controls with in of combined mode chewers smokers and alcohol ( CSA ) , smokers with alcohol showed significant difference ( P < 0.01 ) than controls . The IL-18 levels also differed significantly ( P < 0.05 ) with smokers and chewers in higher stages of III and IV , and showed non significant with in lower stages . Tobacco exposure enhance the inflammation in prostate carcinoma patients in stratified group as it have been represented as a risk factors in various cancers , but this study provide further its role that seems to influence inflammation especially in prostate carcinoma .
Tumors are infiltrated by macrophages , T and B-lymphocytes , which may favor tumor development by promoting angiogenesis , growth and invasion . The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical relevance of the relative amount of macrophages ( CD68+ ) , T-cells ( CD3+ and B-cells ( CD20+ ) at the invasive front of breast carcinomas , and the expression of matrix metalloproteases ( MMPs ) and their inhibitors ( TIMPs ) either at the invasive front or at the tumor center . We performed an immunohistochemical study counting CD3 , CD20 and CD68 positive cells at the invasive front , in 102 breast carcinomas . Also , tissue sections were stained with MMP-2 , -9 , -11 , -14 and TIMP-2 antibodies , and immunoreactivity location , percentage of reactive area and intensity were determined at the invasive front and at the tumor center . The results showed that an increased CD68 count and CD68/(CD3+CD20) ratio were directly associated with both MMP-11 and TIMP-2 expression by mononuclear inflammatory cells at the tumor center ( p = 0.041 and p = 0.025 for CD68 count and p = 0.001 and p = 0.045 for ratio , respectively for MMP-11 and TIMP-2 ) . In addition , a high CD68/(CD3+CD20) ratio ( >0.05 ) was directly associated with a higher probability of shortened relapse-free survival . Multivariate analysis revealed that CD68/(CD3+CD20) ratio was an independent factor associated with distant relapse-free survival ( RR : 2.54 , CI : ( 1.23-5.24 ) , p<0.01 ) . Therefore , CD68/(CD3+CD20) ratio at the invasive front could be used as an important prognostic marker .
Previously , we reported that Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis and gastric cancer are closely associated with increased levels of hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) and that Korean red ginseng significantly reduced the severity of H. pylori-associated gastric diseases by attenuating H2S generation . Because the incubation of endothelial cells with H2S has been known to enhance their angiogenic activities , we hypothesized that the amelioration of H2S-induced gastric inflammation or angiogenesis in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) might explain the preventive effect of Korean red ginseng on H. pylori-associated carcinogenesis . The expression of inflammatory mediators , angiogenic growth factors , and angiogenic activities in the absence or presence of Korean red ginseng extracts ( KRGE ) were evaluated in HUVECs stimulated with the H2S generator sodium hydrogen sulfide ( NaHS ) . KRGE efficiently decreased the expression of cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase , enzymes that are essential for H2S synthesis . Concomitantly , a significant decrease in the expression of inflammatory mediators , including cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase , and several angiogenic factors , including interleukin ( IL)-8 , hypoxia inducible factor-1a , vascular endothelial growth factor , IL-6 , and matrix metalloproteinases , was observed ; all of these factors are normally induced after NaHS . An in vitro angiogenesis assay demonstrated that NaHS significantly increased tube formation in endothelial cells , whereas KRGE pretreatment significantly attenuated tube formation . NaHS activated p38 and Akt , increasing the expression of angiogenic factors and the proliferation of HUVECs , whereas KRGE effectively abrogated this H2S-activated angiogenesis and the increase in inflammatory mediators in vascular endothelial cells . In conclusion , KRGE was able to mitigate H2S-induced angiogenesis , implying that antagonistic action against H2S-induced angiogenesis may be the mechanism underlying the gastric cancer preventive effects of KRGE in H. pylori infection .
BACKGROUND Dendritic cells ( DCs ) isolated from tumor bearing animals or from individuals with solid tumors display functional abnormalities and the DC impairment has emerged as one mechanism for tumor evasion from the control of the immune system . Ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) , the most common pancreatic cancer , is recognized as a very aggressive cancer type with a mortality that almost matches the rate of incidence . METHODS We examined the systemic influence ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) exerted on levels of peripheral blood DCs and inflammatory mediators in comparison to the effects exerted by other pancreatic tumors , chronic pancreatitis , and age-matched controls . RESULTS All groups examined , including PDAC , had decreased levels of myeloid DCs ( MDC ) and plasmacytoid DCs ( PDC ) and enhanced apoptosis in these cells as compared to controls . We found elevated levels of PGE2 and CXCL8 in subjects with PDAC , and chronic pancreatitis . Levels of these inflammatory factors were in part restored in PDAC after tumor resection , whereas the levels of DCs were impaired in the majority of these patients approximately 12 weeks after tumor removal . Our results prove that solid pancreatic tumors , including PDAC , systemically affect blood DCs . The impairments do not seem to be tumor-specific , since similar results were obtained in subjects with chronic pancreatitis . Furthermore , we found that PDAC patients with a survival over 2 years had significant higher levels of blood DCs compared to patients with less than one year survival . CONCLUSIONS Our findings points to the involvement of inflammation in the destruction of the blood MDCs and PDCs . Furthermore , the preservation of the blood DCs compartment in PDAC patients seems to benefit their ability to control the disease and survival .
We studied the effect of the immune system on two differentially aggressive melanomas developing in mice on conditional deletion of the INK4A/ARF tumor suppressor gene , with concomitant expression of oncogene H-Ras(G12V) and a natural cancer-germline tumor antigen ( TA ) . " Slow progressor " melanomas contained no activated T lymphocytes ( TL ) . In contrast , " aggressive " melanomas were infiltrated by activated TLs lacking effector molecules and expressing high levels of PD-1 , indicating an exhausted phenotype . Aggressive melanomas were also infiltrated by immature myeloid cells ( IMC ) . Infiltration was associated with local inflammation and systemic Th2/Th17-oriented chronic inflammation that seemed to impair further activation of TLs , as tumor-specific T cells adoptively transferred into mice bearing aggressive melanomas were poorly activated and failed to infiltrate the melanoma . This immunosuppression also led to the incapacity of these mice to reject inoculated TA-positive tumors , in contrast to slow-progressing melanoma-bearing mice , which were responsive . To test the role of adaptive immunity in tumor progression , we induced melanomas in immunodeficient RagKO compound mice . These mice developed aggressive but not slow-progressing melanomas at a higher frequency and with a shorter latency than immunocompetent mice . Immunodeficient mice also developed abnormal inflammation and infiltration of IMCs in a manner similar to immunocompetent mice , indicating that this phenotype was not dependent on adaptive immunity . Therefore , tumor-intrinsic factors distinguishing the two melanoma types control the initiation of inflammation , which was independent of adaptive immunity . The latter delayed development of aggressive melanomas but was overridden by inflammation .
