**Note

- label-1 - Activating invasion and metastasis: Cancer cells can break away from their site of origin to invade surrounding tissue and spread to distant body parts.
- label-2 - Avoiding immune destruction: Cancer cells are invisible to the immune system.
- label-3 - Deregulating cellular energetics: Most cancer cells use abnormal metabolic pathways to generate energy, e.g. exhibiting glucose fermentation even when enough oxygen is present to properly respire.
- label-4 - Enabling replicative immortality: Non-cancer cells die after a certain number of divisions. Cancer cells, however, are capable of indefinite growth and division (immortality).
- label-5 - Evading growth suppressors: Cells have processes that halt growth and division. In cancer cells, these processes are altered so that they donâ€™t effectively prevent cell division.
- label-6 - Genomic instability and mutation: Cancer cells generally have severe chromosomal abnormalities, which worsen as the disease progresses.
- label-7 - Inducing angiogenesis: Cancer cells are able to initiate angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels are formed, thus ensuring the supply of oxygen and other nutrients.
- label-8 - Resisting cell death: Apoptosis is a mechanism by which cells are programmed to die in the event that they become damaged. Cancer cells are able to bypass these mechanisms.
- label-9 - Sustaining proliferative signaling: Healthy cells require molecules that act as signals for them to grow and divide. Cancer cells, on the other hand, are able to grow without these external signals.
- label-a - Tumor promoting inflammation: Inflammation affects the microenvironment surrounding tumors, contributing to the proliferation, survival and metastasis of cancer cells.
