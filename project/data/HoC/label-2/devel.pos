The ultraviolet radiation present in sunlight is immune suppressive . Recently we showed that solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation ( ultraviolet A + B ; 295-400 nm ) , applied after immunization , suppressed immunologic memory and the elicitation of delayed-type hypersensitivity to the common opportunistic pathogen , Candida albicans . Further , we found that wavelengths in the ultraviolet A region of the solar spectrum ( 320-400 nm ) , devoid of ultraviolet B , were equally effective in activating immune suppression as ultraviolet A + B radiation . Here we report on the mechanisms involved . Maximal immune suppression was found when mice were exposed to solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation 7-9 d post immunization . No immune suppression was found in ultraviolet-irradiated mice injected with monoclonal anti-interleukin-10 antibody , or mice exposed to solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation and injected with recombinant interleukin-12 . Suppressor lymphocytes were found in the spleens of mice exposed to ultraviolet A + B radiation . In addition , antigen-specific suppressor T cells ( CD3+ , CD4+ , DX5+ ) were found in the spleens of mice exposed to ultraviolet A radiation . Applying liposomes containing bacteriophage T4N5 to the skin of mice exposed to solar-simulated ultraviolet A + B radiation , or mice exposed to ultraviolet A radiation , blocked immune suppression , demonstrating an essential role for ultraviolet-induced DNA damage in the suppression of established immune reactions . These findings indicate that overlapping immune suppressive mechanisms are activated by ultraviolet A and ultraviolet A + B radiation . Moreover , our findings demonstrate that ultraviolet radiation activates similar immunologic pathways to suppress the induction of , or the elicitation of , the immune response .
The effect of peptides released during the fermentation of milk on the humoral immune system and on fibrosarcoma growth was studied . Lactobacillus helveticus was able to release peptidic compounds during milk fermentation due to its high proteolytic activity , as was shown by the degree of proteolysis and size-exclusion HPLC elution profiles . Three fractions of these compounds were separated and fed to mice during different periods ( 2 , 5 , and 7 d ) . The humoral immune response was assessed by following the number of IgA-secreting cells , and the antitumor activity was monitored by studying the regression of subcutaneously implanted fibrosarcomas . Feeding during 2 and 7 d with the medium-sized fraction ( Fraction II ) significantly increased the IgA-producing cells in the intestines , whereas feeding with the large compound fraction ( Fraction I ) during 5 d and the small compound fraction ( Fraction III ) during all three feeding periods provided similar increases . A double dose of Fraction II showed the highest IgA-producing cell count . The increase by Fraction III was shown to be caused by the presence of L-Tryptophan . Fraction II significantly decreased the size of fibrosarcoma when previously fed during 7 d , and feeding with Fraction I during 5 d decreased significantly its size after 35 d of growth . Although the mechanisms by which lactic acid bacteria enhance the immune system are not clear , this study clearly shows that bioactive compounds released in fermented milks contribute to the immunoenhancing and antitumor properties of these products . The release of bioactive peptides by lactic acid bacteria can have important implications on the modulation of the cellular immune response .
The role of T cells in eradicating leukemic cells has been well demonstrated for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . Type 1 ( T1 ) T-cell cytokines play a major role in this antileukemic immune effect . Studies in cancer patients have demonstrated a decreased T1 cytokine production , measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells . This observation of malignancy-related suppressed T1 cytokines also occurs in untreated chronic-phase ( CP ) CML , raising the question of the influence of different CML treatment regimens on this immunosuppression . Intracellular flow cytometry ( ICF ) has facilitated the evaluation of cytokines on a single-cell level . This study analyzed T1 ( interferon-gamma ) cytokine production in purified peripheral blood T cells by ICF , comparing different therapy approaches for CML . Twenty-one newly diagnosed CP CML patients were compared with 24 patients treated with interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) and to 30 allogeneic bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) recipients ( BCR-ABL negative by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction , and free of , or having only limited graft-versus-host disease at the time of study ) . Thirty-seven healthy controls were included . Our results showed a significantly decreased T-cell IFN-gamma synthesis in CP CML patients in relation to healthy controls ( P = 0.0007 ) . Treatment with IFN-alpha resulted in a shift from immunosuppression--documented for the group of untreated patients--to immunopotentiation , with an increase of T-cell IFN-gamma production ( P = 0.0266 ) . Notably , BMT enhanced IFN-gamma production of T cells to a level not only exceeding untreated patients ( P < 0.0001 ) but also healthy volunteers ( P < 0.0001 ) . The observation of T1 cytokine up-regulation with IFN-alpha therapy indicates that enhanced T-cell function may be achievable in patients with CML , even in the absence of an allo-response .
Transforming growth factor-beta1 ( TGF-beta1 ) exerts potent immunosuppressive effects . In this study , we investigated the potential role of TGF-beta1 produced by hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cell lines in immunosuppression mechanisms . Using the Mv1Lu cell-growth inhibition assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , we detected optimal levels of TGF-beta1 in the culture supernatants conditioned by the HCC cell lines PLC/PRF/5 , Hep3B , and HepG2 . To determine the biological activity of TGF-beta1 in the supernatants , we examined the effects of the culture supernatants on the production of interferon ( IFN)-gamma induced during the culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) stimulated with interleukin ( IL)-12 . IFN-gamma production of IL-12-stimulated PBMCs in the 1:1 dilution of the acid-activated conditioned medium of PLC/PRF/5 , Hep3B , and HepG2 reduced to 14.7 +/- 0.8 , 17.3 +/- 9.0 , and 35.9 +/- 14.6% , respectively , compared with the value in the culture with control medium ( complete culture medium ) . These results suggest that HCC cells producing TGF-beta1 may reduce the generation or activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) and natural killer ( NK ) cells , and thus could enhance their ability to escape immune-mediated surveillance .
Hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment plays a central role in the evolution of immune escape mechanisms by tumor cells . In this study , we report the definition of miR-210 as a miRNA regulated by hypoxia in lung cancer and melanoma , documenting its involvement in blunting the susceptibility of tumor cells to lysis by antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL). miR-210 was induced in hypoxic zones of human tumor tissues . Its attenuation in hypoxic cells significantly restored susceptibility to autologous CTL-mediated lysis , independent of tumor cell recognition and CTL reactivity . A comprehensive approach using transcriptome analysis , argonaute protein immunoprecipitation , and luciferase reporter assay revealed that the genes PTPN1 , HOXA1 , and TP53I11 were miR-210 target genes regulated in hypoxic cells . In support of their primary importance in mediating the immunosuppressive effects of miR-210 , coordinate silencing of PTPN1 , HOXA1 , and TP53I11 dramatically decreased tumor cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated lysis . Our findings show how miR-210 induction links hypoxia to immune escape from CTL-mediated lysis , by providing a mechanistic understanding of how this miRNA mediates immunosuppression in oxygen-deprived regions of tumors where cancer stem-like cells and metastatic cellular behaviors are known to evolve .
Macrophages are the prominent components of solid tumors and have complex dual functions in their interaction with cancer cells . Strong evidence suggests that TAM is a part of inflammatory circuits that promote tumor progression . B7-homologue 3 ( B7-H3 ) , a recently identified homologue of B7.1/2 ( CD80/86 ) , has been described to exert co-stimulatory and immune regulatory functions . Here , we showed that a fraction of macrophages in tumor stroma expressed surface B7-H3 molecule . Normal macrophages , which did not express B7-H3 , would be induced expressing B7-H3 molecule when culturing with tumor cell . Although a lung cancer cell line constitutively expressed B7-H3 mRNA and protein in plasma , primary tumor cell isolated from the transplanted lung carcinoma model expressed B7-H3 on the surface . Interestingly , in transplanted lung carcinoma model , the expression of membrane-bound B7-H3 in tumor cells was increased as prolonging of tumor transformation . In support , IL-10 released from TAM could stimulate cancer cell expression of membrane bound B7-H3 . Furthermore , Lung cancer and TAM-related B7-H3 was identified as a strong inhibitor of T-cell effect and influenced the outcome of T cell immune response . In conclusion , TAM-tumor cell interaction-induced membrane-bound B7-H3 represents a novel immune escape mechanism which links the pro-inflammatory response to immune tolerance in the tumor milieu .
Nutrient deprivation based on the loss of essential amino acids by catabolic enzymes in the microenvironment is a critical means to control inflammatory responses and immune tolerance . Here we report the novel finding that Tph-1 ( tryptophan hydroxylase-1 ) , a synthase which catalyses the conversion of tryptophan to serotonin and exhausts tryptophan , is a potent regulator of immunity . In models of skin allograft tolerance , tumor growth , and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , Tph-1 deficiency breaks allograft tolerance , induces tumor remission , and intensifies neuroinflammation , respectively . All of these effects of Tph-1 deficiency are independent of its downstream product serotonin . Because mast cells ( MCs ) appear to be the major source of Tph-1 and restoration of Tph-1 in the MC compartment in vivo compensates for the defect , these experiments introduce a fundamentally new mechanism of MC-mediated immune suppression that broadly impacts multiple arms of immunity .
Complex interactions between effector T cells and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells ( Treg ) contribute to clinical outcomes in cancer , and autoimmune and infectious diseases . Previous work showed that IL-12 reversed Treg-mediated suppression of CD4(+)Foxp3(-) T cell ( Tconv ) proliferation . We and others have also shown that Tregs express T-bet and IFN-gamma at sites of Th1 inflammation and that IL-12 induces IFN-gamma production by Tregs in vitro . To investigate whether loss of immunosuppression occurs when IFN-gamma is expressed by Tregs we treated mouse lymphocyte cultures with IL-12 . IFN-gamma expression did not decrease the ability of Tregs to suppress Tconv proliferation . Rather , IL-12 treatment decreased Treg frequency and Foxp3 levels in Tregs . We further showed that IL-12 increased IL-2R expression on Tconv and CD8 T cells , diminished its expression on Tregs and decreased IL-2 production by Tconv and CD8 T cells . Together , these IL-12 mediated changes favored the outgrowth of non-Tregs . Additionally , we showed that treatment with a second cytokine , IL-27 , decreased IL-2 expression without augmenting Tconv and CD8 T cell proliferation . Notably , IL-27 only slightly modified levels of IL-2R on non-Treg T cells . Together , these results show that IL-12 has multiple effects that modify the balance between Tregs and non-Tregs and support an important role for relative levels of IL-2R but not for IFN-gamma expression in IL-12-mediated reversal of Treg immunosuppression .
Tumor-infiltrating immune cells can promote chemoresistance and metastatic spread in aggressive tumors . Consequently , the type and quality of immune responses present in the neoplastic stroma are highly predictive of patient outcome in several cancer types . In addition to host immune responses , intrinsic tumor cell activities that mimic stem cell properties have been linked to chemoresistance , metastatic dissemination and the induction of immune suppression . Cancer stem cells are far from a static cell population ; rather , their presence appears to be controlled by highly dynamic processes that are dependent on cues from the tumor stroma . However , the impact immune responses have on tumor stem cell differentiation or expansion is not well understood . In this study , we demonstrate that targeting tumor-infiltrating macrophages and inflammatory monocytes by inhibiting either the myeloid cell receptors CSF1R or CCR2 decreases the number of tumor-initiating cells in pancreatic tumors . Targeting CCR2 or CSF1R improves chemotherapeutic efficacy , inhibits metastasis and increases antitumor T-cell responses . Tumor-educated macrophages also directly enhanced the tumor-initiating capacity of pancreatic tumor cells by activating the transcription factor STAT3 , thereby facilitating macrophage-mediated suppression of CD8+ T lymphocytes . Together , our findings show how targeting tumor-infiltrating macrophages can effectively overcome therapeutic resistance mediated by tumor-initiating cells .
BACKGROUND & AIMS Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is an aggressive malignancy with few treatment options . As the status of the tumour immune microenvironment can affect progression of established tumours , we evaluated potential immune mechanisms associated with survival in HCC . METHODS Immune gene expression profiles were analyzed in tumour and non-tumour liver tissues from resected HCC patients using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry . Tumour-infiltrating leukocytes ( TILs ) were isolated to verify the expression of immune genes and to identify proliferating TILs . These parameters were analyzed statistically in relation with patient survival and tumour phenotype ( apoptosis and proliferation ) . RESULTS The immune microenvironment within tumours was found to be heterogeneous , although globally more inert compared to the adjacent non-tumour liver tissue . Univariate analysis in 61 patients identified a group of innate immune genes whose expression within tumours is positively associated with patient survival . TNF , IL6 and CCL2 are the most significant genes , with TNF being an independent predictor of survival in multivariate analysis . The gene set includes macrophage and NK-associated molecules such as TLR4 , TLR3 , CCR2 , NCR3 . Most of these molecules are expressed by TILs . Importantly , proliferating immune cells , predominantly NK and T cells , are present in tumours of patients with longer survival , and exclusively in areas devoid of proliferating tumour cells . NK and CD8(+) T cell densities are correlated positively with tumour apoptosis , and negatively with tumour proliferation . CONCLUSIONS Hence , an inflammatory immune microenvironment within HCC tumours could be an important means to control tumour progression via TIL activation and proliferation .
