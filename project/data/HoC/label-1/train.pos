NIH-3T3 cells are non-tumorigenic when injected into athymic mice . If these cells are mixed with an extract of basement-membrane proteins ( matrigel ) and injected s.c. , they form locally invasive and highly vascularized tumors . Cells cultured from the NIH-3T3-matrigel-induced tumors showed a transformed phenotype and lacked contact inhibition . When cultured in a gel of matrigel , they proliferated and formed branched and invasive colonies . In contrast , the parental NIH-3T3 cells cultured on matrigel remained as cell aggregates and were not invasive . I.V. injections of the tumor-derived NIH-3T3 cells produced many colonies on the surface of the lungs , whereas the parental NIH-3T3 cells were not metastatic . Zymographic analysis of the conditioned media obtained from both the tumor-derived and parental NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated higher amounts of the 72-kDa gelatinase ( type-IV collagenase ) enzyme in the tumor-derived cells . Also , tumor-derived NIH-3T3 cells , but not parental NIH-3T3 cells , secreted the 92-kDa type-IV collagenase . These studies suggest that the interaction of pre-malignant NIH-3T3 cells with extracellular matrix components may contribute to the process of tumor progression .
Melanocyte stimulating hormone ( alpha-MSH , alpha-melanotropin),Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Ly-Pro-Va l-NH2 , regulates melanogenesis within epidermal melanocytes of many animals . An MSH analogue ( [ Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH ) that exhibits superpotency and prolonged biological activity has been synthesized , biologically characterized , and is presently in clinical trials to determine its possible clinical use in tanning of the skin . It also has potential for the diagnosis , localization , and chemotherapy of melanoma . The effects of this analogue on the growth , metastatic behavior , and invasive potential of a melanotic variant of Cloudman S-91 murine melanoma are reported here . In an intracutaneous murine model of melanoma cell tumor growth , the analogue did not increase primary tumor growth ( size ) after the period of administration of the peptide hormone analogue and did not affect spontaneous lung metastases . Survival times for the control and melanotropin-treated groups were similar , suggesting that overall tumor burden was not affected by treatment with the hormone analogue . Last , melanoma cell invasion through a human amniotic basement membrane in vitro was not enhanced compared to untreated cells .
The involvement of signal transduction systems in the initial attachment of two murine B16 melanoma clones of differing metastatic potential to extracellular matrix components was examined to learn more of the early events in cell-matrix interaction . Clones of high and low metastatic capacity attached similarly in the absence of any stimulators , exhibiting a two phase time course of attachment with 100% attachment by 60 min . A slight difference in attachment characteristics between the clones was seen in response to phorbol ester stimulation , which significantly inhibited attachment of the low metastatic clone but which had no effect on the highly metastatic clone . Total protein kinase C activity and distribution was similar for both clones . Attachment of both clones was severely reduced , however , if intracellular calcium was elevated or intracellular calmodulin inhibited . This study suggests that signal transduction mechanisms are involved in melanoma cell attachment to matrix proteins and offers an approach to pharmacological manipulation of these cell-matrix interactions which may be relevant to reducing metastatic spread .
Between 1965 and 1985 , 489 patients with advanced gastric cancer who were treated with gastric resection and in whom tumor cells remained after the operation were defined as cases of a " noncurative resection. " The clinicopathological features and prognosis of these patients were examined and two groups were prepared : locally advanced cancer and cancer with a distant metastasis . In locally advanced cancer cases , tumor cells remained in the neighboring organs , lymph nodes , and/or resected margins ; in those with distant metastasis , peritoneal dissemination and/or liver metastasis were present regardless of whether or not the metastasis was removed , with or without locally noncurative factors . Serosal invasion was prominent and high rates of lymph node metastasis and lymphatic involvement were evident in both groups . The survival rate for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer was better than that of patients with distant metastasis ( P < 0.01 ) . Survival time in patients with locally advanced cancer can be lengthened by resecting all of the primary tumor and as much of the metastatic lesions as possible , even if the surgical management is " noncurative. " Aggressive postoperative chemotherapy for patients with distant metastasis from a gastric cancer is to be recommended .
Histopathological features of the lymph node involvement were studied in 104 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer who underwent subtotal esophagectomy combined with extended radical lymph adenectomy in cervicothoracoabdominal region . Metastatic involvement was found in a total number of 503 lymph nodes from 73 patients by histologic examination . The mean of long and short diameter was found to be less than 5mm in 125 ( 24.9% ) of these 503 nodes . The involved area on the section was less than one third in 149 nodes ( 29.6% ) , and was significantly smaller in mediastinal lymph nodes than those in cervical or abdominal ones . Sixty-seven ( 13.3% ) of 503 nodes were partially invaded by micrometastasis of 1mm or less in diameter . Micrometastasis also more frequently occurred in mediastinal nodes with a statistically significant difference . Extranodal proliferation ( ENP ) of cancer cells was found in 106 nodes ( 21.1% ) , and extranodal lymphatic and/or blood vessel invasion ( ENly , v ) was also recognized in 60 nodes ( 11.9% ) . Micrometastasis and ENP with or without ENly , v were found in 24 ( 32.9% ) and 29 ( 39.7% ) of 73 patients with positive lymph node metastasis , respectively . Postoperative survival rate in patients with micrometastasis and/or ENP with or without ENly , v was inferior to that in patients with neither of them .
BACKGROUND Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) are a gene family of zinc enzymes capable of degrading almost all of the extracellular matrix macromolecules in vivo . Their enzymic activities are believed to be responsible for tumor invasion and metastasis . METHODS In this study , using peroxidase-antiperoxidase method , monospecific antisera against MMP-1 ( tissue collagenase ) , MMP-2 ( type IV collagenase/72-kilodalton [ KD ] gelatinase ) , and MMP-3 ( stromelysin ) were applied to 29 squamous cell carcinomas and normal epithelium of the esophagus to identify cells synthesizing and secreting these enzymes . RESULTS Immunoreactivity of MMP-1 , -2 , and -3 was observed in small cancer nests of the deeply invasive or marginal portion of the tumor . Among the 29 patients studied , the presence of at least one MMP was observed in 17 ( 58.6% ) . All three enzymes were observed in six ( 20.6% ) patients , MMP-2 and -3 in five ( 17.2% ) patients , only MMP-2 in three ( 10.3% ) patients , and MMP-3 alone in three ( 10.3% ) patients . There was a good correlation among histologic stage and tumor invasion , lymph node metastasis , and MMP expression . In particular , expression of MMP-2 and -3 was closely related to lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion . CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that MMP , especially MMP-2 and -3 , play an important role in tumor invasion and metastasis and that analysis of MMP-2 and -3 production is useful for evaluation of malignant potential in esophageal carcinoma .
Urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( u-PA ) plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis . The aim of this work was to study the u-PA production , in vitro and in vivo , in a transplantable murine mammary adenocarcinoma ( M3 ) , moderately metastatic to lung , and in a related tumor variant ( MM3 ) , highly metastatic to the same organ , during tumor development . At different times post-transplantation , tumors were employed to prepare either primary cell cultures or homogenates . PA activity from conditioned media ( CM ) , cell lysates ( CLs ) and tumor homogenates ( THs ) was quantitated by means of a fibrinolytic assay . Immunoneutralization and zymographic assays were performed to identify the PA present in both tumors . PA activity in CM , CLs and THs , that was undetectable at early stages , increased significantly along the growth of M3 adenocarcinoma . Secreted PA activity in MM3 CM was measurable at early stages and consistently increased up to 37 days post-transplantation , but a marked fall of activity was found at 48 days . PA activity in MM3 THs exhibited the same enhancement and late fall found in vitro . A positive correlation was observed between tumor size and THs PA values in both tumors . The PA present in cell cultures and THs was identified as of the u-PA type . These results support the hypothesis that high u-PA levels are important for tumor invasion and that the stage of tumor development is a critical factor in their PA activity .
Peptide 11 , CDPGYIGSR-NH2 , is a segment of laminin which blocks tumor cell invasion . A high affinity laminin receptor in tumor cells is thought to be blocked by the carboxyl-terminal YIGSR , and conformational energy calculations suggest that the glycine in YIGSR allows an important conformational bend . We replaced the YIGSR glycine residue in peptide 11 with either D-alanine or L-alanine to allow or disfavor the proposed glycine bend . We found the Gly7-->D-Ala7 analog to be equal to peptide 11 in inhibiting tumor cell invasion of basement membrane matrix . The Gly7-->L-Ala7 analog was much less capable of invasion inhibition . Two-dimensional 1H-1H NMR was used to study the solution conformations of the peptide 11 analogs . NOESY experiments revealed close NH-NH contacts in peptide 11 and the D-Ala7 analog , but not in the L-Ala7 analog . Molecular dynamics generated low energy structures with excellent NOE agreement for peptide 11 and its analogs . Both peptide 11 and the D-Ala7 analog , but not the less active L-Ala7 analog , were predicted to have similar bends around Gly7 or D-Ala7 . These results suggest that a bend in the YIGSR region of peptide 11 may be important for the binding of laminin to its metastasis-associated receptor .
Thirty-five cases of clear cell sarcoma of soft tissues were studied to determine the clinical or morphologic features that are important in predicting prognosis . Tumors occurred most commonly in the extremities , and the majority of the patients were young women . Surgery was the elected treatment in every case . Five patients experienced local recurrences , and metastases developed in 22 . Fifty-four percent of the patients died of tumor , 11% are alive with disease , and the remaining 34% are alive and well ; the average survival for each group was 67 months , 113 months , and 103.5 months , respectively . This sarcoma is characterized by small clusters of polygonal to spindle cells featuring clear to slightly basophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli . The clusters are separated by delicate fibrous septa . In a deletion , clear cell sarcoma has low mitotic activity , little or no necrosis , and mild nuclear pleomorphism . Tumor size and the presence of necrosis are statistically significant predictors of prognosis . All 12 patients with tumors measuring > 5 cm died of disease or are alive with disease . Eleven of the 20 patients with tumors measuring < 5 cm are alive with no evidence of disease . Tumor necrosis was present in 10 cases ; eight of these patients died of disease and one is alive with disseminated metastases .
We analyzed the clinico-pathological features of the initial tumors in 205 patients with superficial bladder cancer , admitted to Kyoto University Hospital between 1974 and 1988 , to investigate the prognostic factors for progression to the muscle invasive disease or metastasis . Of 205 patients , 35 ( 17% ) exhibited muscular invasion alone ( 12 patients ) and/or metastasis ( 23 patients ) . Tumor multiplicity , higher grade and positive urinary cytology were the significant risk factors for later malignant progression . Expression of A , B , H-blood group isoantigens in the bladder tumor were significantly decreased from the onset in the patients with initially T1 tumor but not in those with Ta tumor . Significant loss of expression was also found at the time of progression in the initially Ta cases . Thus , loss of A , B , H-blood group antigen expression seems to be correlated with the malignant potential of superficial bladder cancer . However , more feasible and reliable diagnostic markers such as molecular genetical and biochemical markers remain to be developed to predict the malignant potential of the superficial bladder cancer .
Considerable debate centers on the optimal treatment for vulvar melanoma , as well as those clinicopathological factors influencing prognosis . We reviewed 80 patients with vulvar melanoma seen between 1949 and 1990 . Primary tumors were assessed according to Chung ( 47 patients ) and Breslow ( 65 patients ) microstaging systems . Fifty-nine patients ( 76% ) underwent radical vulvectomy , ten patients ( 13% ) had a partial vulvectomy , and nine patients ( 12% ) had a wide local excision . Fifty-six also underwent inguinal node dissection . Median follow-up was 193 months . Median survival was 63 months . Ten-year survival by Chung level was as follows : I 100% ; II , 81% ; III , 87% ; IV , 11% ; V , 33% . Ten-year survival by tumor thickness was as follows : 0.75 mm , 48% ; 0.75-1.5 mm , 68% ; 1.51-3.0 mm , 44% ; greater than 3.0 mm , 22% . Increased depth of invasion was associated with increased incidence of inguinal node metastasis . Cox regression analysis demonstrated prognostic significance for tumor thickness ( P less than 0.001 ) , inguinal node metastasis ( P less than 0.001 ) , and older age at diagnosis ( P less than 0.001 ) . Radical vulvectomy did not seem to improve survival over less radical procedures . Based on this experience , we recommend radical local excision for patients with malignant melanoma of the vulva . Patients who have more than a superficially invasive melanoma should also have inguinal lymph node dissection .
To characterize the impact of increased production of TGF-beta in a xenograft model of human breast cancer , TGF-beta-responsive MDA-231 cells were genetically modified by stable transfection so as to increase their production of active TGF-beta1 . Compared with control cells , cells that produced increased amounts of TGF-beta proliferated in vitro more slowly . In vivo , however , tumors derived from these cells exhibited increased proliferation and grew at an accelerated pace . To evaluate the role of autocrine TGF-beta signaling , cells were also transfected with a dominant-negative truncated type II TGF-beta receptor ( TbetaRII ) . Disruption of autocrine TGF-beta signaling in the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells reduced their in vivo growth rate . Co-inoculation of Matrigel with the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells expressing the truncated TbetaRII compensated for their diminished in vivo growth capacity , compared with the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells with an intact autocrine loop . Tissue invasion by the tumor was a distinctive feature of the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells , whether or not the autocrine loop was intact . Furthermore , tumors derived from TGF-beta-overexpressing cells , irrespective of the status of the autocrine TGF-beta-signaling pathway , had a higher incidence of lung metastasis . Consistent with the suggestion that TGF-beta's enhancement of invasion and metastasis is paracrine-based , we observed no significant differences among the cell clones in an in vitro invasion assay . Thus , in this experimental model system in vitro assays of cell proliferation and invasion do not accurately reflect in vivo observations , perhaps due to autocrine and paracrine effects of TGF-beta that influence the important in vivo-based phenomena of tumor growth , invasion , and metastasis .
p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in many human malignancies , including gastric cancer . It remains unclear why patients with germ-line p53 mutations ( i.e. , Li-Fraumeni syndrome ) are not at increased risk for gastric adenocarcinoma , despite the fact that they show a high rate of many other tumors . Furthermore , the precise relationship between germ-line p53 mutations and the response to chronic bacterial infections ( such as Helicobacter spp. ) has not been investigated . To assess the role of germ-line p53 deletions in modulating the progression to gastric cancer , p53(+/-) and wild-type ( WT ) C57BL/6 mice were infected with H. felis . The gastric pathology and immune response in these two groups of mice were analyzed for up to 15 months postinfection . The gastric fundus and antrum were evaluated independently using a 0-4 scale to score inflammation , parietal and chief cell loss , mucus metaplasia , and helicobacter colonization . Nonparametric statistical analysis was performed to determine the effects of p53(+/-) , infection status , and postinoculation ( p.i. ) time on inflammation , preneoplastic changes , invasive lesions , and helicobacter colonization. mRNA expression for gammaIFN , interleukin ( IL)-1 , IL-10 , and IL-4 was quantified by PCR . Sera were also evaluated for H. felis antibody by ELISA . Antral inflammation increased significantly with time in infected mice . There was a significant , protective effect on the development of preneoplastic fundic lesions and invasive carcinoma attributable to the deletion of one p53 allele ( P < 0.05 ) . Submucosal invasive foci were observed in 9 of 11 WT-infected mice ranging from 13 to 15 months p.i. ; invasion of adjacent submucosal blood vessels by glandular epithelia also was present in 5 of these mice . None of these lesions were observed in 33 p53(+/-) mice , infected or not , at any time p.i. p53(+/-) mice had significantly higher helicobacter colonization consistent with a Th2 host response . In sera from WT mice , IgG2a , considered a proinflammatory Th1 response , continued to rise throughout the 15-month study ( P < 0.004 ) . In contrast , IgG2a levels of the p53(+/-) mice were 50-60% lower than those of the WT mice at each time point ( P range , <0.012 to 0.002 ) and did not progress in magnitude between 12 and 15 months of chronic H. felis infection ( P = 0.167). mRNA levels for gammaIFN and IL-1 were significantly up-regulated in WT mice infected with H. felis ( P < 0.05 ) but were slightly elevated or were at background levels in p53(+/-) mice . IL-10 and IL-4 mRNA expression was not significantly different from control samples . Our results support the hypothesis that germ-line deletion of one p53 allele results in a down-regulated Th1 response to gastric helicobacter infection , possibly because of T-cell senescence , which may indirectly protect against the development of gastric cancer and other epithelial-derived neoplasms associated with chronic inflammation .
AIMS Tumour cell growth results from a disturbance in the balance between the rate of proliferation and cell death . In this study , proteins involved in the regulation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were studied as possible factors responsible for uncontrolled cell growth in colorectal cancer . METHODS The expression of proteins involved in these processes was investigated in 48 metastases from patients with colorectal cancer and compared with eight normal colon mucosa samples and 14 primary tumours . Both primary tumours and metastases were obtained from eight patients . The expression of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , p53 , retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) , Fas receptor , Fas ligand , bcl-2 , mcl-1 , bax , and bcl-x was measured using immunohistochemistry . Proliferation was determined by Ki67 staining , whereas apoptosis was assessed by M30 immunostaining , which recognises cleaved cytokeratin 18 . RESULTS In the limited number of cases in which paired comparisons were possible , the expression of TS and Ki67 was significantly higher in metastases than in the matched primary tumour samples ( p = 0.014 and 0.016 , respectively ) , whereas Rb expression was lower in metastases than in primary tumours ( p = 0.024 ) . Fas receptor expression was high in normal mucosa but absent in primary tumours and metastases , whereas the opposite was seen for p53 . The expression of bax , mcl-1 , and bcl-x in normal mucosa was more apical than that seen in malignant cells , where a more diffuse expression pattern was seen ( p < 0.04 ) . Apoptosis was more abundant in primary tumours than in metastases . CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that proliferation and apoptosis are disturbed during colorectal cancer progression , and this is accompanied by loss of Rb and Fas expression , the accumulation of p53 and TS , and changes in the expression patterns of bax , mcl-1 , and bcl-xl .
It is well known that cell-mediated immunity is suppressed in patients with neoplastic diseases . We have reported that soluble receptors for interleukin-2 ( sIL-2R ) and tumor necrosis factor ( sTNF-R1 ) are elevated in the serum of patients with advanced colorectal cancer . The presence of these soluble receptors and immunosuppressive cytokines , including interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) , might be important in the mechanisms of immunosuppression. cis-Diaminedichloroplatinum ( cisplatin ) has been reported to immunomodulate , especially when used in low dose in combination with 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) . In this study , cisplatin and UFT , a form of uracil and tegafur which is a prodrug of 5-FU , were administered with immunomodulator Polysaccharide K ( PSK ) to ten patients with colorectal cancer , who showed distant metastasis in the liver or lung , and the serum levels of sIL-2R and sTNF-R1 and the production of gamma-interferon ( gamma-INF ) and interleukin-10 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured . The serum concentrations of sIL-2R and the production of IL-10 were reduced ( p < 0.05 ) after 2 months of treatment . Thus , this combination appeared to have immunomodulative potential in patients with advanced colorectal cancer .
The retinoic acid receptor beta2 ( RARbeta2 ) protein is a putative tumor suppressor that inhibits proliferation and can induce apoptosis when introduced into breast , cervical , lung , and pancreatic cancer cell lines . To determine if RARbeta2 suppresses proliferation of mammary-derived cancer cells in vivo , we transduced MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells with the LXSN retroviral vector containing RARbeta2 and implanted LXSN vector- or RARbeta2-transduced cells into the mammary fat pads of nude and severe combined immune deficiency ( SCID ) mice . We analyzed the xenografts for several tumor parameters , including tumor size , inflammation , vascularity , mitoses , tumor recurrence at the primary site following resection , and metastases . We found that 19 of 52 mice inoculated with vector-transduced cells developed metastases in multiple organs while only one of 55 mice receiving RARbeta2-transduced cells displayed evidence of metastases ( p < 0.000001 , combined experiments , two-tailed Fisher's exact test ) . Moreover , RARbeta2-tumor cell recipient mice had a lower incidence of post-resection tumor recurrence ( 8/55 vs. 25/52 , p = 0.0004 ) , 34% less necrosis ( in three of four experiments , p = 0.001 ) , and 39% fewer mitoses in tumor tissue ( p < 0.000001 ) . Our findings suggest that RARbeta2 may play a role in inhibiting the metastatic cascade in a mouse mammary gland xenograft tumor model and is a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention in human breast cancer .
PURPOSE Astrocytoma arises in the central nervous system as a tumor of great lethality , in part because of the invasive potential of the neoplastic cells that are able to release extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes . Furin convertase activates several precursor matrix metalloproteases involved in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix . In the present study inhibition of furin was achieved by gene transfer of alpha(1)-antitrypsin Portland ( PDX ) cDNA . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN This furin inhibitor was transfected into two tumorigenic astrocytoma cell lines . The inhibitory effect was evaluated using in vivo tumorigenicity , invasion , and proliferation assays , as well as by investigating impairment of furin substrate processing . RESULTS Expression of PDX prevented the s.c. growth of the transfected cells . Invasion assays demonstrated that PDX-transfected cells exhibited a reduced invasive ability in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore , s.c. growth of PDX transfectant xenotransplants showed a significant reduction in size that coincided with a significant decrease of the in vitro doubling time and of the in vivo cell proliferation ability . Additional studies showed that the furin substrates insulin-like growth factor IR , transforming growth factor beta and membrane type 1-matrix metalloprotease were not activated in PDX-expressing astrocytoma cells . CONCLUSIONS PDX expression in astrocytoma cells demonstrated a direct mechanistic link between furin inhibition , and decreased astrocytoma proliferation and invasive ability . Because furin inhibition inhibits both invasiveness and cell growth in astrocytoma , furin should be considered a promising target for glioblastoma therapy .
Immunosuppression has been related to the incidence of tumor apparition , including endocrine tumors . The intrasplenic ovarian tumor ( luteoma ) is a typical benign endocrine tumor that develops under high gonadotropin stimulation and , from the immunological perspective , is located in a critical organ involved in immune response . To establish if immunosuppression could alter the development of this experimental tumor , the effects of cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and dexamethasone ( Dex ) were evaluated . After surgery , tumor-bearing and sham animals were kept without treatment for 4 weeks ; thereafter , they were distributed into CsA ( 25 mg/kg ) , Dex ( 0.1 mg/kg ) , or vehicle ( 75:25 castor oil:ethanol ) groups and were injected on alternate days for 50 days . Body weight was evaluated weekly . Animals were sacrificed after a jugular vein blood sample was obtained . Thymi were weighed . Tumors were measured and placed in formaline for histological studies . Serum luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , prolactin ( PRL ) , and estradiol were measured by radioimmunoassay . Hematological parameters were determined . CsA induced a significant decrease in survival rates both in tumor-bearing and sham animals ( P < 0.01 ) . Dex significantly impaired weight increase in both groups of animals . CsA induced a significant weight loss in sham animals , not observed in tumor-bearing animals . Dex induced thymus weight loss in both groups , whereas CsA induced thymus weight loss only in sham animals . Only Dex induced a decrease in lymphocyte number in both groups . CsA induced an increase in monocyte number only in sham animals . Treatments did not alter LH , FSH , or estradiol , whereas PRL was increased by CsA only in sham rats . Neither Dex nor CsA induced any significant variations in tumor volume , nor did they alter tumor histology . In addition , no visible metastases or alterations in other organs were observed . We conclude that , though immunological parameters were altered by the treatments , immunosuppressor drugs did not condition tumor development . In addition , tumors secrete one or more factor/s that counteract CsA effect .
p107 Links to cyclin A/CDK2 ( cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ) and cyclin E/CDK2 that are important cell cycle regulators . However , p107 expression remains unclear in almost all kinds of human solid tumours . To clarify the expression of p107 in colorectal tumours , 22 normal mucosae , 9 hyperplastic polyps , 60 adenomas , 198 primary carcinomas , 21 lymph-nodal metastases , and 10 hepatic metastases were immunohistochemically stained for p107 , cyclin A , cyclin E , CDK2 and Ki67 . Results were measured using labelling indices ( LIs). p107 LIs surpassed the highest value in normal tissues in six of nine hyperplastic polyps , 54 of 60 adenomas , 144 of 198 primary cancers , 13 of 21 nodal foci and three of 10 hepatic foci. p107 LIs also apparently rose from normal through hyperplasia and adenoma to early carcinoma . However , they declined in liver-metastatic foci , and in primary cancers showing large size , mucinous type , venous invasion , lymphatic invasion , poorly differentiated type , deep invasion , lymph-nodal metastasis , hepatic metastasis or advanced stage . Low p107 LIs were also linked to a poor survival , particularly in stage-III patients . As the p107 LI gradually rose , the CDK2 ( in primary cancers only ) , cyclin A , cyclin E and Ki67 LIs were elevated concurrently-in both adenomas and primary cancers . Thus , in colorectal tumours , p107 expression rises abnormally and gradually during carcinogenesis and then falls during invasion , and thereby probably perturbs the cell-cycle control and promotes carcinogenesis and invasion . Clinically , reduced p107 may indicate a poorer prognosis .
It is still difficult to decide on the treatment modalities for advanced esophageal carcinoma when the prognostic factors of T4 esophageal cancer are not fully understood . In this article , we report that among 71 patients with T4 thoracic esophageal cancer , 49 underwent esophagectomy , 9 had curative resection ( R0 group ) , and 40 had palliative resection ( R1/2 group ) . A total of 22 patients had palliative treatments : bypass in 5 ( bypass group ) , gastrostomy or jejunostomy in 6 ( stoma group ) , and radiochemotherapy alone in 11 ( nonoperation group ) . Clinicopathologic characteristics were retrospectively investigated . Treatment-related deaths occurred in 7 ( 10% ) : none in R0 , 3 ( 8% ) in R1/2 , 3 ( 60% ) in bypass , and 1 ( 17% ) in stoma group . Swallowing was improved in 50 ( 70% ) patients : 9 ( 100% ) in R0 , 30 ( 75% ) in R1/2 , 1 ( 20% ) in bypass , 3 ( 50% ) in stoma , and 7 ( 64% ) in the nonoperation group . One- , two- , and three-year overall survival rates were 56% , 22% , and 22% in the R0 group and 35% , 19% and 6% in the R1/2 group , respectively ( p = 0.19 ) . In the bypass , stoma , and nonoperation groups , none survived 1.6 years . The factors influencing the survival rate of the 49 patients undergoing esophagectomy were grade of lymph node metastasis , amount of perioperative blood transfusion , lymph vessel , and blood vessel invasion . Among these , independent prognostic factors for survival were amount of blood transfusion ( -6 units vs. -7 units , p <0.0001 ) and grade of lymph node metastasis [ none- or peritumoral [ lymph nodes adjacent to the main tumor or at a nearby location ( <3 cm ) from the tumor ] metastasis vs. more distant metastasis [ lymph nodes at a distant location ( > 3 cm) ] , p = 0.016 ] . Bypass and stoma operation neither prolonged the survival nor improved the difficulty of swallowing compared with radiochemotherapy alone . Esophagectomy can achieve the best improvement of swallowing and the longest survival with an acceptable mortality rate . Esophageal carcinoma patients with T4 disease and distinct metastasis in the lymph nodes at a distant location ( >3 cm ) from the primary tumor may not benefit from an esophageal resection .
We used cDNA-based genomic microarrays to examine DNA copy number changes in a panel of prostate tumors and found a previously undescribed amplicon on chromosome 17 containing a novel overexpressed gene that we termed prostate cancer gene 17 ( PRC17 ) . When overexpressed in 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells , PRC17 induced growth in low serum , loss of contact inhibition , and tumor formation in nude mice . The PRC17 gene product contains a GTPase-activating protein ( GAP ) catalytic core motif found in various Rab/Ypt GAPs , including RN-Tre . Similar to RN-Tre , we found that PRC17 protein interacts directly with Rab5 and stimulates its GTP hydrolysis . Point mutations that alter conserved amino acid residues within the PRC17 GAP domain abolished its transforming abilities , suggesting that GAP activity is essential for its oncogenic function . Whereas PRC17 is amplified in 15% of prostate cancers , it is highly overexpressed in approximately one-half of metastatic prostate tumors . The potent oncogenic activity of PRC17 is likely to influence the tumorigenic phenotype of these prostate cancers .
We have previously reported the frequent occurrence of bile duct invasion by liver metastases from colorectal cancer . We found that patients with macroscopic intrabiliary cancer growth survive longer after hepatectomy than those without this feature . In the present study , we analyzed the clinicopathological features of primary colorectal cancer showing macroscopic intrabiliary extension of liver metastases . We reviewed 217 patients who underwent initial hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastasis between 1992 and 1998 , and analyzed the corresponding primary colorectal cancers clinicopathologically . Microscopic bile duct invasion was found in 89 of 217 cases ( 40.6% ) and , of these cases , 23 ( 10.6% ) had macroscopic intrabiliary extension . Histological sections of the corresponding primary colorectal cancer were available in eight ( group A ) of these 23 cases . These were compared with 20 cases , selected randomly , of colorectal cancer that did not show bile duct invasion and were diagnosed as liver metastases . These patients underwent hepatectomy during the same period as group A and were used as a control ( group B ) . The histology of the primary tumors revealed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma in 100% of group A and in 25% of group B. The average maximum diameter of the primary tumor was 5.32 cm in group A and 3.61 cm in group B. Venous invasion was detected in 25% of group A and in 90% of group B ( P < 0.01 ) , while the incidences of lymphatic vessel invasion and lymph node metastases were similar between the groups . These data suggest that macroscopic intrabiliary extension could be a good indicator of a unique subgroup of colorectal cancers showing less aggressive features even though they develop liver metastases . Careful histological evaluation is important even for metastatic tumors .
Prognosis of patients with non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) remains difficult to assess , even after adjustment for pathological stage . Prognostic value of numerous biological markers has been evaluated , with conflicting results . Data of 86 patients with NSCLC treated by surgery were collected with clinical characteristics , histopathological data including tumor differentiation and status of blood and lymphatic vessel invasion and evaluation by immunohistochemistry of Rb , Bcl-2 and Ki-67 expression . Prognostic values for overall survival ( OS ) and event-free survival ( EFS ) were analyzed by the log tank test and the multivariable Cox model . Using univariable analyses , pT , pN , poor differentiation or large cell subtype were associated with a poor OS , while lymphatic and/or blood vessel invasion were associated with a short EFS . None of the molecular markers had a significant prognostic value for either outcome . In multivariable analyses , only stage remained of prognostic value for OS . Interestingly , the presence of blood vascular invasion in the tumor was significantly predictive for subsequent metastatic occurrence in stages I and II . This feature might , therefore , be relevant for administration of adjuvant therapy in completely resected NSCLC .
INTRODUCTION AND AIMS The survival of pancreatic cancer patients with portal vein resection is extremely poor due to the high incidence of liver metastasis . The occurrence of liver metastasis is decreased by locoregional arterial infusion after pancreatic surgery . Chemosensitivity tests can provide the basis for individualized chemotherapy in each patient and predict the clinical response . Therefore , the current study was designed to clarify whether locoregional chemotherapy based on the results of chemosensitivity tests has the clinical effects of preventing liver metastasis and improving survival for patients with portal vein resection . METHODOLOGY The resected specimens from 40 of 47 patients with resection of pancreatic cancer were assessed for chemosensitivity to various anticancer drugs . Fourteen patients underwent portal vein resection due to direct invasion , and nine of these patients received intra-arterial adjuvant chemotherapy on the basis of the results of MTT assay to prevent liver metastasis . The remaining five patients received no chemotherapy . RESULTS None of the patients who received intra-arterial chemotherapy had liver metastasis , and this group of patients had improved survival . The mean survival of patients with intra-arterial chemotherapy was significantly longer than that of patients without chemotherapy ( 25.6 months with chemotherapy versus 9.4 months without chemotherapy ) . CONCLUSION A pilot study of postoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy showed the reduction of liver metastasis and improvement of survival among pancreatic cancer patients with portal vein resection .
BACKGROUND A retrospective study was performed to determine the indications for positron emission tomography ( PET ) using [ (18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) in patients with esophageal cancer , including those with early cancer , and to investigate whether the tumor-to-normal ratio ( T/N ratio ) could be used as a substitute for the standardized uptake value ( SUV ) . METHODS Thirty-six patients were included in the study . Thirty-one patients who had 36 biopsy-proven lesions ( 35 squamous cell carcinomas and one small cell carcinoma ) underwent PET study prior to treatment . PET images were evaluated visually and the relationship between the depth of invasion and the PET findings were examined in 22 lesions of 19 patients from whom specimens were obtained from the primary tumor by surgery or endoscopic mucosal resection . PET results were also compared with computed tomography ( CT ) and endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) for detection of regional lymph node metastases in 18 patients who underwent extended lymph node dissection . Five patients underwent PET studies for the detection of recurrence and the PET findings were compared with their CT findings . The T/N ratio and the SUV were calculated for 20 primary tumors . RESULTS Among the 15 tumors that were pT1b or greater , all 15 were positive on PET and all seven of the lesions confined to the mucosa ( Tis or T1a ) were negative . The sensitivity , specificity and accuracy of detecting nodal involvement were , respectively , 37.5 , 96.1 and 88.3% by CT , 30.8 , 88.5 and 81.0% by EUS and 41.7 , 100 and 92.2% by PET . More sites of recurrence were detected by PET than by CT . There was no statistically significant correlation between the SUV and the T/N ratio . CONCLUSIONS PET imaging can detect primary esophageal cancer with a depth of invasion of T1b or greater , but Tis and T1a tumors are undetectable . PET seems to be more accurate than CT or EUS for diagnosing lymph node metastasis . The T/N ratio cannot be used as a substitute for the SUV .
Rho GTPases are signaling molecules known to control cell motility . Several recent studies have suggested a role for Rho proteins in mediating tumor metastasis independent of their affects on cell proliferation . As Rho proteins require post-translational modification with a geranlygeranyl moiety for full activity , we tested the affect of blocking geranylation on localization , downstream signaling , and stimulation of invasion . Expression of a constitutively active Rho construct in A375 melanoma cells dramatically stimulated invasion through Matrigel membranes ; however , a constitutively active RhoA mutated so that it cannot be geranylated , failed to stimulate invasion . Moreover , expression of epitope or GFP tagged modifications of this nongeranylatable constitutively active Rho demonstrated that geranylation is necessary for correct cellular localization of Rho . Geranylation was also found to be necessary for full downstream activation of serum response factor mediated transcription . Pharmacologic inhibition of Rho geranylation produced similar inhibition of Rho localization , signaling , and invasion . Our results suggest that inhibition of Rho geranylation may be an attractive pharmacologic target for inhibiting melanoma metastasis .
BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE Altered cell adhesion has a critical role in the development of epithelial cancers . E-cadherin act on the maintenance of cell-cell adhesion and its function was thought to be regulated by associated cytoplasmic proteins , such as alpha-catenin and beta-catenin . This study was designed to examine the expression of beta-catenin in gastric carcinoma and to determine the relationship between tumor characteristics and survival . METHODS Immunohistochemical staining of beta-catenin and E-cadherin was performed in 148 patients with gastric carcinoma . RESULTS Abnormal expression of beta-catenin and E-cadherin was performed in 148 patients with gastric carcinoma . RESULTS Abnormal expression of beta-catenin and E-cadherin was demonstrated in 43.2% and 44.6% of tumors respectively . Up to 63% of tumors stained abnormally for one or two components of the cadherin-catenin complex ( beta-catenin , E-cadherin ) . Abnormal beta-catenin and E-cadherin staining occurred more frequently in poor differentiated tumor than in good differentiated tumors ( P < 0.005 , respectively ) . There was a significant correlation between abnormal beta-catenin expression and depth of invasion(P < 0.025 ) . Moreover , abnormal beta-catenin expression was more frequent in tumors with positive lymph node metastasis ( 45/84 , 53.6% ) and distance metastasis(21/31 , 67.7% ) than in tumors without lymph node metastasis ( 19/64 , 29.7% ) ( P < 0.005 ) and distance metastasis ( 43/117 , 36.8% ) ( P < 0.005 ) . A survival advantage was noted in tumors retaining normal membranous expression of beta-catenin , independent of type , grade , or stage ( P < 0.005 ) . CONCLUSIONS Abnormal expression of the E-cadherin-catenin complex occurs frequently in gastric carcinoma . The close correlation with poor survival suggests that abnormal beta-catenin may be a useful prognostic marker .
AIM The study was designed to explore the effects of antisense human telomerase RNA ( ahTR ) on the malignant phenotype of gastric carcinoma cell line SGC-7901 , and its potential role in gene therapy for tumors . METHODS An ahTR eukaryotic expression vector , including the sequence of template region of telomere repeats , was constructed by recombinant technology of molecules and then transfected into gastric carcinoma cell line SGC-7901 by liposome DOTAP . Subsequently , the expression of hTR RNA and ahTR RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction , telomerase activity by telomeric repeat amplification protocol-ELISA ( TRAP-ELISA ) , telomere length by Southern blotting , cell morphology under light microscope , cellular proliferation capacity by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2 thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay , cell-cycle distribution by flow cytometry , efficiency of clone formation in soft agar , and tumorigenecity in nude mice were examined and evaluated in ahTR-transfected cells , control plasmid pCI-neo transfected cells and their parental cells . RESULTS An ahTR eukaryotic expression vector was constructed and successfully transfected into SGC-7901 cells . The telomerase activity in ahTR-transfected SGC-7901 cells decreased from 100% to approximately 25% , and telomere length in the cells shortened to 3.35 from 4.08 Kb at 60 population doublings . Compared with the parental cells and pCI-neo transfected cells , ahTR-transfected cells displayed some morphological changes , such as decreased atypia , and recovery of contact inhibition and density inhibition under light microscope . Furthermore , ahTR-transfected cells displayed decreased invasive capacity in Borden's chamber invasive model , increased G0/G1 phase rate and apoptotic rate . Surprisingly , ahTR-transfected SGC-7901 cells lost their capacity for clone formation in soft agar and tumorigencity in nude mice . CONCLUSION Antisense-hTR transfection can inhibit the growth of SGC-7901 cells and partially reverse the malignant phenotypes . This study provides an exciting approach for cancer therapy by inhibiting telomerase activity using an antisense gene .
PURPOSE The roles of terminal sialyl and fucosyl residues in cell surface glycans in the metastatic potential of H7721 cells , a human hepatocarcinoma cell line , were studied . METHODS Neuraminidase and alpha-L-fucosidase were used to remove the sialyl and fucosyl residues , respectively . Cell adhesion to fibronectin ( Fn ) , laminin ( Ln ) , and human umbilical vein epithelial cell ( HUVEC ) , as well as chemotactic cell migration and invasion , were selected as the parameters of metastatic potential ex vivo . RESULTS Sialyl residue is not essential for cell adhesion to Fn , but is important in cell adhesion to Ln and invasion , and is crucial in cell adhesion to HUVEC and migration . In contrast , fucosyl residue contributes more than sialyl residue to cell adhesion to Fn and Ln , but less to adhesion to HUVEC , and is not essential in chemotactic cell migration and invasion . Cell adhesion to HUVEC , migration , and invasion were inhibited by the monoclonal antibody of sialyl Lewis X , but not by the antibody of non-sialyl Lewis X. CONCLUSION Terminal sialyl residues on cell surface glycans are more important than fucosyl residues in mediating cell adhesion to HUVEC and cell migration/invasion , but the reverse is true in cell adhesion to Fn and Ln .
Prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) receptor subtype EP(2) , which is coupled to cAMP metabolism , is known to mediate proliferation of primary human keratinocytes in vitro . The effect of gain or loss of EP(2) receptors in immortalized human keratinocytes ( HaCat cells ) was examined . HaCat keratinocytes were transfected with sense or anti-sense constructs of the EP(2) receptor . Loss or gain of EP(2) expression was documented by immunoblot and associated changes in agonist-stimulated cAMP production . Loss or gain of EP(2) receptor expression correlated with alterations in plating efficiencies but with modest affects on growth . When cell lines were studied in an organ culture model , anti-sense clones were highly invasive compared with vector controls and sense transfectants . A marked increase in prostaglandin production is commonly seen in malignant lesions . Because prostaglandin receptors are known to undergo ligand-induced receptor down-regulation , we sought to determine whether EP(2) receptor down-regulation results in increased invasiveness . In vector controls , invasiveness was reproduced by ligand-dependent EP(2) receptor down-regulation as assessed by immunohistochemistry . In addition , loss of EP(2) receptor expression was associated with decreased paxillin expression , a critical component of focal adhesion assembly . Thus , down-regulation of EP(2) receptors represents a potential mechanism for neoplastic progression to an invasive phenotype .
Our previous studies have shown that genistein inhibits the growth of PC3 prostate cancer cells and induces apoptosis by inhibiting nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and Akt signaling pathways . To better understand the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which genistein exerts its effects on PC3 cells , we utilized cDNA microarray to interrogate 12,558 known genes to determine the gene expression profiles altered by genistein treatment . We found a total of 832 genes that showed a greater than twofold change after genistein treatment from two independent experiments with a high degree of concordance . Among these genes , 774 genes were down-regulated and 58 genes were up-regulated with genistein treatment . Cluster analysis showed nine different types of expression alternations . These genes were also subjected to cluster analysis according to their biological functions . We found that genistein regulated the expression of genes that are critically involved in the regulation of cell growth , cell cycle , apoptosis , cell signaling transduction , angiogenesis , tumor cell invasion and metastasis . Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analysis was used to confirm the results of cDNA microarray , and the results of RT-PCR were consistent with the microarray data . We conclude that genistein affected the expression of a large number of genes that are related to the control of cell survival and physiologic behaviors . The gene expression profiles provide comprehensive molecular mechanism(s) by which genistein exerts its pleiotropic effects on cancer cells . Genistein-induced regulation of these genes may be further exploited for devising chemopreventive and/or therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer .
Tumor metastasis represents a complex multistep process that requires migration , invasion , and angiogenesis . In this study , we examined the impact of molecular blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor on the invasive and metastatic capacity of human squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the head and neck using in vitro and in vivo model systems . Treatment with the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody C225 attenuated the migration of SCC-1 tumor cells through a chemotaxis chamber in a dose-dependent manner . Incubation of SCC cells with 10-100 nM C225 for 4 h resulted in 40-60% inhibition of cell migration . Furthermore , in the presence of C225 , the capacity of SCC-1 to invade across a layer of extracellular matrix ( Matrigel ) was significantly inhibited . Using an in vivo orthotopic floor-of-mouth xenograft model , locoregional tumor invasion of SCC-1 into muscle , vessel , bone , and perineural tissues was inhibited in C225-treated mice . This inhibition was additionally characterized by down-regulation in the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 . These data suggest that inhibition of metastatic potential by C225 may be mediated via decreased migration and invasion of SCC cells . Regarding angiogenesis in vitro , we first studied human umbilical vascular endothelial cells , which established a capillary-like network structure ( tube formation ) in the presence of reconstituted Matrigel . Treatment with C225 reduced cell-to-cell interaction of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells , resulting in disruption of tube formation . The effect of C225 was additionally examined using an in vivo tumor xenograft neovascularization model of angiogenesis . Systemic treatment with C225 not only reduced tumor growth and the number of blood capillaries but also hindered the growth of established vessels toward the tumor . Taken together , these results provide evidence that C225 can suppress tumor-induced neovascularization and metastasis in SCC of the head and neck .
We investigated the effectiveness of continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion ( CHPP ) for the peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer . A total 124 patients with advanced gastric cancer were enrolled in this study . Prophylactic CHPP ( P-CHPP ) was performed in 45 patients who had macroscopic serosal invasion without peritoneal dissemination , and 79 patients without CHPP were a control group . Therapeutic CHPP ( T-CHPP ) was performed in 21 patients with peritoneal dissemination , and 52 patients without CHPP were a control group . There was no significant difference in 5 year survival between patients treated and not treated with P-CHPP . Univariate analysis showed that location of tumor , tumor diameter , and lymph node metastasis influenced prognosis , but there was no prognostic factor in the Cox proportional regression hazard model . There was no significant difference in 5-year survival between patients treated and not treated with T-CHPP . Univariate analysis showed that degree of peritoneal dissemination and adjuvant chemotherapy influenced prognosis , and the Cox proportional regression hazard model showed that the macroscopic types and degree of peritoneal dissemination affected prognosis . In the patients with CHPP , the incidences of respiratory failure and renal failure were each statistically greater than in the patients undergoing CHPP .
A6 is an eight amino acid peptide derived from the non-receptor binding region of urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) , which interferes with the uPA/uPA receptor system . A6 has been synthesized as a potential anti-angiogenic , anti-cancer agent . The current study has investigated the potential therapeutic activity of A6 in the Lewis lung carcinoma ( 3LL ) model of pulmonary metastasis . A6 was found to have direct anti-tumor activity against established 3LL pulmonary metastases at a low tumor burden ( 10-20 colonies per lung ) and was therapeutic in combination with cyclophosphamide at high tumor burdens ( > 100 colonies per lung ) . Mechanistic studies have revealed that A6 directly inhibits the invasion of 3LL cells through a Matrigel model basement membrane by 40-45% . Moreover , treatment with either A6 or doxorubicin resulted in thicker tubes in endothelial tube formation studies . Our results suggest that A6 , by virtue of its anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic properties , might work additively or synergistically with chemotherapeutic agents and thereby contribute to enhanced therapy of established 3LL cancer metastases .
The colon carcinoma cell line CC531 is metastatic to liver after splenic injection in syngeneic rats . After repeated in vivo passages , a subline was selected that produced liver metastases at a considerably higher rate than the original cell line . These cells were characterized by increased intracellular glutathione , proliferation and ability to restore glutathione after exposure to oxidative stress , thus indicating an elevated resistance to oxidative stress . Furthermore , the increased metastatic ability was also accompanied by increased proliferation rate , adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and endothelial cells , and secretion of a 60 kD matrix metalloproteinase . When cultured in vitro for a prolonged time ( more than 30 trypsinizations ) , the cells showed a reduced in vivo metastatic ability , reduced secretion of three metalloproteinases including the 60 kD proteinase , and reduced intracellular glutathione . These results indicate that metastatic ability can be influenced through several adaptive mechanisms , and that the cell's ability to resist oxidative stress and maintain intracellular glutathione are of central importance .
BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE There is little ideal predictor available on evaluating the lymph node metastatic potential of breast carcinoma . This study was designed to determine the expression of gene products of E-cadherin ( epithelial ) , N-cadherin ( nerve ) , and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) in breast carcinoma tissue and investigate their association with the invasion and metastasis of breast carcinoma . METHODS The authors examined the expressions of E-cadherin , N-cadherin , and MMP-9 in 72 cases of breast carcinoma(39 cases with lymph node metastasis and 33 cases without lymph node metastasis ) by immunohistochemistry . Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the patients ' prognosis . RESULTS The average ranks of E-cadherin in lymph node metastasis group and no lymph node metastasis group were 29.19 and 45.14 , respectively , with significant difference ( P < 0.001 ) . The expression of E-cadherin was correlated inversely with the metastasis of breast carcinoma . The average ranks of N-cadherin and MMP-9 were 40.04 and 42.97 in lymph node metastasis group , and 32.32 and 28.85 in no lymph node metastasis group , both with significant difference ( P < 0.05 ) , and these expressions were positively correlated with the lymph node metastasis of breast carcinoma . The patients who had high expression of E-cadherin had a longer survival time . CONCLUSION Expression of E-cadherin , N-cadherin , and MMP-9 are associated strongly with lymph node metastasis of breast carcinoma . These proteins are indicators of metastasis potential and prognosis of breast carcinoma .
BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE Usually pituitary adenomas are histological benign and grow slowly , but a proportion of them will become locally aggressive , and develop into invasive pituitary adenomas . The reasons for these differences in tumor behavior are poorly understood . Pituitary adenomas are abounding blood vessels . Angiogenesis and tumor invasion both require degradation of the extracellular matrix components to allow cell migration . The matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) may play a central role in these processes . The aggressive mechanism of pituitary adenomas was studied through investigating the expression of MMP-9 , MMP-2 , TIMP-1 , and TIMP-2 in both invasive and non-invasive adenomas . METHODS Sixty-one surgical removed pituitary adenomas ( forty-nine cases invasive and twelve non-invasive adenomas ) were investigated . Immunohistochemistry staining ( SP method ) was used to detect the expression of MMP-9 , MMP-2 , TIMP-1 , and TIMP-2 in two groups . The results were treated with semi-quantitative method and analyzed by using non-parameter rank sum test . RESULTS Immunohistochemical staining of tumor cells for MMP-9 , TIMP-1 , MMP-2 , and TIMP-2 were noted 95.9% ( 47/49 ) , 57.1% ( 28/49 ) , 75.5% ( 37/49 ) and 89.8% ( 44/49 ) in invasive adenomas , and 100% ( 12/12 ) , 91.7% ( 11/12 ) , 66.7% ( 8/12 ) , and 91.7% ( 11/12 ) in non-invasive adenomas , respectively . Invasive tumors were significantly less expressing TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 ( P < 0.05 ) . There was no significant difference for MMP-9 or MMP-2 between invasive and non-invasive groups ( P > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 may play a key role in invasive pituitary adenomas to biological behavior .
Adenoid cystic carcinoma ( ACC ) of the salivary glands is a highly infiltrative malignant tumour with a tendency for lung metastasis . Gene therapy could be a potentially effective therapy for ACC and its metastasis . The aims of the study were : To transduce interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene into an ACC cell line with predisposition for lung metastasis ( ACC-M ) ; to compare the bioactivity of the gene-transduced cells and the parent cell line in vitro and in vivo . The IL-2 gene was transduced via a bicistronic retroviral vector into the ACC-M cells . The growth rate and DNA cell cycles of the parent ACC-M , the control viral vector AmGCEN , and the gene transduced AmIL-2 cell cultures were compared quantitatively and by flow cytometry , respectively . The tumourigenic ability of the three cell lines was verified by inoculation in athymic nude mice . The tumours developed were extracted and compared quantitatively and histologically . There was no difference in the growth rate and the DNA count between the ACC-M , AmGCEN , and AmIL-2 cell cultures . In the animal experiment , both the ACC-M and AmGCEN cells stimulated lung metastasis in all the mice , whereas there was no tumour found in the 1 x 10(6) AmIL-2 cells inoculation . On 3 x 10(6) AmIL-2 cells stimulation , three out of six mice developed tumours but the mass and volume of the tumours were smaller than the other two groups . Under light microscopy , the ACC-M tumours were mainly poorly differentiated with minimal cellular matrix , whereas the AmIL-2 tumours were well differentiated with ample matrix . The transduction of IL-2 gene can reduce the tumourigenicity of ACC-M cells and induces tumour cell differentiation in mice . The IL-2 gene can be a potential effective gene for the treatment of adenoid cystic carcinoma of salivary glands and its lung metastasis .
PURPOSE Although the adrenal gland is a common site of extrahepatic metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , there are no definitive guidelines for the treatment of adrenal metastasis . This study examines the effectiveness of various treatments for this disease . METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 20 patients treated for adrenal metastasis of HCC by adrenalectomy ( n = 13 ) , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , or percutaneous ethanol injection therapy ( PEIT ) ( n = 7 ) . RESULTS There were no significant differences in cumulative survival rates between patients given adrenalectomy and those given TACE or PEIT , either after completing treatment for primary HCC or after the first treatment for adrenal metastasis . Six of seven patients with tumor thrombi in the inferior vena cava ( IVC ) from adrenal metastasis underwent adrenalectomy combined with intracaval thrombectomy , five of whom survived for more than 1 year after surgery , and two of whom are still alive without any recurrence more than 3 years after surgery . PEIT showed good results for small adrenal metastasis . CONCLUSION These findings suggest that therapeutic modalities should be chosen according to the clinical features of each individual , including the size of the metastatic tumor , whether there is invasion into the IVC , the function of the remaining liver , and the existence of intra- and/or nonadrenal extrahepatic lesions . Furthermore , intracaval tumor thrombectomy could be indicated for patients with IVC thrombus if they are suitable candidates for surgery .
Recent reports provide evidence that some growth factors behave as inhibitors of the apoptosis of the endothelial cells , bringing forward the concept of vascular survival as a post-angiogenesis process . At least two different vasculature development processes occur within a tumor : the angiogenic ( formation of new vessels ) and the vascular survival pathway , which is devoted to the preservation of the newly-formed vessels in layers that lose contact with the adjacent normal tissue . We developed a method to assess these processes in tissue samples . We noted that differences among tumors may exist not only in the tumor angiogenic activity ( TAA ) but also in the vascular survival ability ( VSA ) . One third of the highly angiogenic breast cancer cases examined had a poor ability to maintain high vessel density in inner tumor areas . Both parameters are independently related to prognosis , while VSA was directly related to tumor dimensions and node involvement . Patients with high TAA and VSA had a particularly poor prognosis . It is suggested that although cancer angiogenic activity is important for the local invasion and dissemination into vessels and lymphatics , the VSA may be important for the effective formation of viable tumor foci in lymph nodes or distant organs . Recognition and quantification of the vascular survival ability in human tumors may significantly improve the prognostic value of the assessment of tumor vasculature , and may help to stratify patients for clinical trials with novel anti-angiogenic or angiotoxic drugs . Elucidation of the pathways may provide additional targets for antiangiogenic therapy .
OBJECTIVE To investigate the expression and mutation of MTA1 , nm23H1 and E-cadherin(E-cad) genes in ovarian carcinoma ( OC ) in relation to lymph node ( LN ) metastasis . METHODS A panel of normal ovarian tissues , primary OC specimens and corresponding LNS was examined for mRNA expression and mutation of MTA1 and nm23H1 and protin expression of E-cad genes by using RT-PCR , RT-PCR-SSCP and immunohistochemistry . RESULTS The frequency of MTA1 over expression was 100%(7/7) in primary OC with metastasis but only 38.5%(5/13) in those without metastasis ( P = 0.0103 ) . Overexpression of MTA1 was observed in 87.5%(6/7) of LNS with metastasis but in only 23%(3/13) of LNS without metastasis ( P = 0.0118 ) . In contrast with MTA1 , low expression of nm23H1 mRNA was seen in 7 of 7 OC with metastasis but only in 4 of 13(30%) of those without metastasis ( P = 0.0043 ) . Low nm23H1 expression was also seen in 7 of 7 LNS with metastasis but only in 5 of 13 ( 38.5% ) nonmetastatic LNS ( P = 0.0102 ) . Meantime , no expression of E-cad protein was observed in 7 of 7 OC with metastasis but in 6 of 13(46.2%) of those without metastasis ( P = 0.044 ) . In correlation analysis of the three genes , MTA1 reversely correlated with nm23H1 and E-cad respectively ( r = -0.903 , -0.803 ) , and positive correlation existed between nm23H1 and E-cad ( r = 0.724 ) . No mutation of MTA1 , nm23H1 and was found by SSCP analysis . CONCLUSION The mRNA expression of MTA1 , nm23H1 and E-cad is positively and negatively correlated with LN metastasis . The expression abnormalities but not the mutations of the three genes are frequent events related to LN metastasis of ovarian cancer .
The identification of molecular markers related to critical biological processes during carcinogenesis may aid in the evaluation of carcinogenic potentials of chemicals and chemical mixtures . Work from our laboratory demonstrated that a single treatment with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine ( MNNG ) enhanced spontaneous malignant transformation of the human keratinocyte cell line RHEK-1 . In contrast , chronic low-level exposure of cells to arsenic alone or in a mixture containing arsenic , cadmium , chromium , and lead inhibited malignant conversion . To identify changes in gene expression that influence these different outcomes , cDNA microarray technology was used . Analysis of multiple human arrays in MNNG-transformed RHEK-1 cells , designated OM3 , and those treated with arsenic or the arsenic-containing metal mixture showed unique patterns of gene expression . Genes that were overexpressed in OM3 included oncogenes , cell cycle regulators , and those involved in signal transduction , whereas genes for DNA repair enzymes and inhibitors of transformation and metastasis were suppressed . In arsenic-treated cells , multiple DNA repair proteins were overexpressed . Mixture-treated cells showed increased expression of a variety of genes including metallothioneins and integrin 4 . These cells showed decreased expression of oncogenes , DNA repair proteins , and genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway . For comparison we are currently analyzing gene expression changes in RHEK-1 cells transformed by other means . The goal of these studies is to identify common batteries of genes affected by chemical modulators of the carcinogenic process . Mechanistic studies may allow us to correlate alterations in their expression with sequential stages in the carcinogenic process and may aid in the risk assessment of other xenobiotics .
BACKGROUND Angiogenesis is of crucial importance for tumor growth and development of metastases . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) has a potent angiogenic activity and mutations of the p53 gene has been thought to upregulate VEGF . The purpose of our study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of these tumor biomarkers for angiogenesis relative to the information derived from established clinicopathological parameters in gastric cancer . METHODS In this study , we conducted an immunohistochemical investigation of VEGF and p53 expression in 145 tissue samples obtained from gastric cancer patients undergoing curative surgical treatment . To evaluate angiogenesis , microvessel density ( MVD ) was counted by staining endothelial cells immunohistochemically using anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody . RESULTS High MVD was significantly associated with depth of tumor invasion and distant metastasis ( p = 0.004 , 0.021 , respectively ) . Moreover , overall survival for patients with high MVD were significantly lower than that of low MVD ( p = 0.048 ) . Positive expression of VEGF correlated significantly with lymph node and distant metastasis ( p = 0.040 , 0.048 , respectively ) . However , no significant correlation was found between p53 expression and various clinicopathological parameters . VEGF positive tumors showed a higher MVD than VEGF negative tumors ( p = 0.028 ) . The expression of p53 did not correlate with VEGF expression . Also , the relationship between the status of p53 expression and MVD had not statistically significant differences . In the multivariate analysis , status of VEGF , p53 expression and MVD were not an independent prognostic factor . CONCLUSION VEGF seems to be an important , clinically relevant inducer of angiogenesis and angiogenesis assessed by the MVD may be a useful marker for predicting metastasis in gastric cancer . However , further studies are warranted to clarify the impact of p53 on the angiogenesis and the prognostic significance of angiogenesis in gastric cancer .
The cellular mechanisms of anti-androgen-induced tumor regression have not been investigated in great detail . We have compared the induction of cell death in the androgen-dependent , non-invasive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line by Casodex and TNF-alpha . Both agents induce a dose and time-dependent decrease in cell viability in vitro . However , Casodex does not induce classical DNA fragmentation to oligonucleosomes typically induced by TNF-alpha , but rather induces cleavage to form intermediate 60 kb DNA fragments . RT-PCR based analysis demonstrates that in LNCaP cells Casodex coordinately alters the expression of steady-state level of mRNAs of several matrix metalloproteases and their cognate inhibitors ( most notably MMP2 and TIMP1 ) . Zymography and reverse zymography confirm that the ratio of metalloprotease(s) to inhibitor(s) is altered in favor of activation of the proteases . In a small percentage of the treated LNCaP cells , the activation of the extracellular matrix ( ECM)-proteases by Casodex also induces an invasive phenotype . The acquisition of an invasive phenotype is not seen when LNCaP cells are treated with TNF-alpha , and is not seen when the LNCaP cells are treated with both compounds simultaneously , suggesting that the phenomenon may be specific to particular classes of compounds . These observations have significant implications in the treatment of prostate cancer , since the appearance of a more aggressive phenotype following treatment is clearly undesirable .
A comparative study was undertaken between cancer of the uterine cervix ( n = 50 ) and female breast cancer ( n = 50 ) with reference to the expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein ( HER-2/neu ) and that of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGF-R ) , both being highly homologous structurally . Expressions of EGF-R and c-erbB-2 oncoprotein were viewed in breast and cervical cancer tissues by immunochemical staining . Cervical cancer cases showed much higher expression of EGF-R which also revealed significant association with the expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein and tumour grading . Among breast cancer cases , over-expression of EGF-R correlated significantly with metastasis of lymph node ; and expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein showed a significant relationship with histological grading of the tumour . Moreover , an association was noticed between the tumour grade and the concomitant immuno positive expression of EGF-R and c-erbB-2 . Our study revealed an existence of a conflicting pattern in the expression of EGF-R and c-erbB-2 oncoprotein between carcinomas of the breast and uterine cervix .
Contradictory results have been reported regarding the association between vascularity ( used as an index of angiogenesis ) and thrombospondin-1 ( TSP-1 ) in human tumours . In previous studies , the reported association was based on the estimated average TSP-1 value per tumour , with a sufficient number of specimens collectively analysed per tumour type . Given the extent of intra-tumour heterogeneity , we determined the association between TSP-1 and vascularity within individual specimens , based on the average values of TSP-1 and vascularity in 10-20 pre-selected areas per tumour . Cells expressing TSP-1 mRNA were visualised by in situ hybridisation and quantified by point counting . Vascularity was quantified by point counting and vessel density of von Willebrand Factor-positive vessels . In 10 ductal breast carcinomas , a direct correlation between TSP-1 and vascularity was found in 4 tumours , no correlation in 3 and an inverse correlation in 3 . The effect of TSP-1 on endothelial cell migration in vitro was assessed in the Boyden chamber assay . TSP-1 stimulated cell migration at low concentrations ( 0.1-10 microg/ml ) and was inhibitory at high concentrations ( 25-100 microg/ml ) . These results suggest that TSP-1 may elicit a concentration-dependent , bi-phasic , effect on angiogenesis .
We present a new cell line , EJ established from an invasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus in a 56-year-old patient . The cells show rapid growth in culture with a doubling time of 16 h and high migration activity . Monolayer-cultured cells were polygonal in shape showing a tendency to pile up without contact inhibition . Subcutaneous transplantation of the EJ cells into nude mice formed solid tumors that were histologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma , whereas no metastasis was observed . Cultured EJ cells produced tissue polypeptide antigen ( IPA ) . Genetic and molecular analyses revealed high telomerase activity but not estrogen receptor alpha expression . Using the DNA sequencing technique , we have screened EJ cells for p53 mutation in exon 5 to 8 but no mutation of p53 was observed . This cell line appears to represent the development of a more malignant clone with divergent receptor function and growth behavior , and provides us with an interesting new tool for the study of tumorigenesis in the human endometrium .
In our study we investigated the level of apoptosis in PBMCs and the serological level of sFas ( CD95/APO-1 ) in 22 patients with malignant melanoma ( 12 patients with unique cutaneous primary tumour and 10 patients with unique brain metastasis ) . The first determination was performed before tumour excision and the second at 6-7 months after excision . Results in patients with primary tumour in the first determination : 6 patients with over normal values in PBMCs apoptosis and 5 patients with increased values of sFas . In the second determination : apoptosis was increased in 5 patients and sFas level was increased in 4 cases . In patients with metastases in the first determination apoptosis of PBMC was increased in 7 cases and sFas in 5 cases . In the second determination apoptosis was increased in 4 cases and sFas was increased in 4 cases . Our results show that half of the investigated patients presented elevated values of PBMCs apoptosis and Fas receptor both before and 6-7 months after tumour excision . Apoptosis values for PBMCs and sFas values were with 1/4 higher than normals . There was no difference in clinical evolution of the patients with normal or increased values for studied parameters . Clinical evolution was performed for 1 year . The presence of increased values for PBMCs and sFas after tumour excision , primary or metastasis is surprising and hard to explain . It is possible that tumoral evolution induces a disregulation at PBMCs level or other cells level that persists unexpectedly , after tumour excision or apoptotic processes , in a certain level to be independent and anterior to tumour development .
The glycolytic phenotype is a widespread phenomenon in solid cancer forms , including breast cancer . Dichloroacetate ( DCA ) has recently been proposed as a novel and relatively non-toxic anti-cancer agent that can reverse the glycolytic phenotype in cancer cells through the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase . We have examined the effect of DCA against breast cancer cells , including in a highly metastatic in vivo model . The growth of several breast cancer cell lines was found to be inhibited by DCA in vitro . Further examination of 13762 MAT rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells found that reversal of the glycolytic phenotype by DCA correlated with the inhibition of proliferation without any increase in cell death . This was despite a small but significant increase in caspase 3/7 activity , which may sensitize cancer cells to other apoptotic triggers . In vivo , DCA caused a 58% reduction in the number of lung metastases observed macroscopically after injection of 13762 MAT cells into the tail vein of rats ( P = 0.0001 , n > or = 9 per group ) . These results demonstrate that DCA has anti-proliferative properties in addition to pro-apoptotic properties , and can be effective against highly metastatic disease in vivo , highlighting its potential for clinical use .
Mutations in the tumor suppressor tuberin ( TSC2 ) are a common factor in the development of lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) . LAM is a cystic lung disease that is characterized by the infiltration of smooth muscle-like cells into the pulmonary parenchyma . The mechanism by which the loss of tuberin promotes the development of LAM has yet to be elucidated , although several lines of evidence suggest it is due to the metastasis of tuberin-deficient cells . Here we show that tuberin-null cells become nonadherent and invasive . These nonadherent cells express cleaved forms of beta-catenin . In reporter assays , the beta-catenin products are transcriptionally active and promote MMP7 expression . Invasion by the tuberin-null cells is mediated by MMP7 . Examination of LAM tissues shows the expression of cleaved beta-catenin products and MMP7 consistent with a model that tuberin-deficient cells acquire invasive properties through a beta-catenin-dependent mechanism , which may underlie the development of LAM .
The anti-apoptotic protein , BAX inhibitor-1 ( BI-1 ) , has a role in cancer/tumor progression . BI-1-overexpressing HT1080 and B16F10 cells produced higher lung weights and tumor volumes after injection into the tail veins of mice . Transfection of BI-1 siRNA into cells before injection blocked lung metastasis. in vitro , the overexpression of BI-1 increased cell mobility and invasiveness , with highly increased glucose consumption and cytosolic accumulation of lactate and pyruvate , but decreased mitochondrial O(2) consumption and ATP production . Glucose metabolism-associated extracellular pH also decreased as cells excreted more H(+) , and sodium hydrogen exchanger ( NHE ) activity increased , probably as a homeostatic mechanism for intracellular pH . These alterations activated MMP 2/9 and cell mobility and invasiveness , which were reversed by the NHE inhibitor , 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride ( EIPA ) , suggesting a role for NHE in cancer metastasis . In both in vitro and in vivo experiments , C-terminal deleted ( CDeltaBI-1 ) cells showed similar results to control cells , suggesting that the C-terminal motif is required for BI-1-associated alterations of glucose metabolism , NHE activation and cancer metastasis . These findings strongly suggest that BI-1 reduces extracellular pH and regulates metastasis by altering glucose metabolism and activating NHE , with the C-terminal tail having a pivotal role in these processes .
Tumor invasion and metastasis are the primary causes of cancer patient mortality , underscoring the need for identification of novel genes and signaling pathways that mediate these prognosis-determining phenomena . To identify and characterize novel lung adenocarcinoma genes associated with lung cancer progression , we created a bioinformatics-based approach that focuses on human cell-cycle-regulated genes that have evolved only in higher organisms but not in lower eukaryotic cells . In siRNA experiments in lung cancer cells , FLJ10540 was identified as one of several novel targets involved in cell migration and invasion . Here , we demonstrate that PI3K inhibition affects FLJ10540-mediated cell migration and invasion and further , that FLJ10540 knockdown ablates AKT-Ser(473) phosphorylation . Taken together , these findings indicate that the FLJ10540/PI3K/AKT pathway may harbor new therapeutic targets for treating invasive lung adenocarcinoma .
OBJECTIVE To analyze histological factors not routinely assessed as potential prognostic factors in renal cell carcinoma , such as tumor necrosis , microscopic vascular invasion , and sinus fat invasion . MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective , analytical study was conducted of surgical specimens from 139 patients with localized renal cell carcinoma who underwent nephrectomy from 1993 to 2005 . Tumor necrosis , microscopic vascular invasion , and sinus fat invasion were analyzed and compared to the classical factors : TNM classification , Fuhrman grade , and tumor size . For statistical analysis , variables analyzed were categorized as pT1 , 2 vs pT3 , 4 ; Fuhrman grade 1 , 2 vs 3 , 4 ; tumor size < 7 cm vs >or= 7cm ; tumor necrosis vs no tumor necrosis ; microvascular invasion of sinus fat vs no invasion . Cancer-specific survival probability and disease-free survival were calculated . A descriptive and analytical statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression for univariate and multivariate analyses . Dependent variables were used to analyze cancer-specific survival rates . Disease-free survival was estimated using a Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves . RESULTS In the univariate analysis , all variables analyzed had a significant influence on death for renal cell carcinoma . In the multivariate analysis , the variable having the greatest influence was Fuhrman grade ( p = 0,032 ) . The variables significantly influencing disease-free survival , estimated by the Cox method , were the pT stage ( p = 0.038 ) and Fuhrman grade ( p = 0.048 ) . CONCLUSIONS In patients with clinically localized renal cell carcinoma undergoing nephrectomy , pT stage and Fuhrman grade are the most important prognostic factors for survival and disease-free survival . Tumor necrosis , microscopic vascular invasion , and sinus fat invasion are prognostic factors for death from renal carcinoma which are associated to TNM classification , Fuhrman grade , and tumor size .
Paragangliomas are relatively uncommon neoplasms that arise in adrenal and extra-adrenal paraganglia of the autonomic nervous system . Parasympathetic paraganglioma develop predominantly in the head and neck . It is exceedingly uncommon to develop a primary intraparathyroid paraganglioma . There is only a single case report in the English literature . The information from the single previous case report ( Medline 1960-2009 ) was combined with this case report . Our patient was a 69 year old woman who presented with a thyroid gland mass , with extension into the substernal space . The patient had a history of renal cell carcinoma removed 18 months before . At surgery , a thyroid lobectomy and a parathyroidectomy were performed . The parathyroid tissue showed a very well defined zellballen arrangement of paraganglion cells within the parenchyma of the parathyroid gland . The cells had ample basophilic , granular cytoplasm . The nuclei were generally round to oval with ' salt-and-pepper ' nuclear chromatin distribution . There was a richly vascularized stroma . Mitotic figures , necrosis , invasive growth , and profound nuclear pleomorphism were absent . The neoplastic cells were strongly and diffusely immunoreactive with chromogranin , synaptophysin , CD56 , and focally with cyclin-D1 . The paraganglioma showed a delicate S-100 protein positive supporting sustentacular framework . Keratin , CD10 , PTH , calcitonin and RCC markers were negative . The patient showed no stigmata of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia ( MEN ) and has no paraganglioma in any other anatomic site . She is alive without any additional findings 12 months after surgery . Isolated paraganglioma within the parathyroid is rare , and should be separated from parathyroid adenoma , hyperplasia or metastatic disease to assure appropriate management .
This research aims to give a new insight to the relationship between host local immune response and the biological behaviour of the tumor by evaluating of intratumoral natural killer ( NK ) cells and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) expressions in oral squamous cell carcinomas . New paraffin sections of the deepest parts of the 46 cases of oral squamous cell carcinomas were immunohistochemically treated by CD57 , selected as NK cell indicator , and TNFalpha monoclonal antibodies . The tumors were graded according to histopathologic grading scores of invasive margins and categorized into 2 groups as " good " and " poor " prognostic groups . Fifteen cases , from which could be obtained full clinical data , were clinically staged and because of the scarcity of the cases in each group were divided , again , two groups as group 1 : stage I+stage II and group 2 : stage III+stage IV . The expression levels of CD57 and TNFalpha were evaluated according to histopathologic grading groups and clinical staging groups . The results showed that the density of CD57+cells ( NK cells ) was statistically lower in tumors graded as poor prognostic group compared to the cases in good prognostic group . On the contrary , expression level of TNFalpha was statistically higher in poor prognostic group . These findings suggested that increased secretion of TNFalpha in the tumors , which show high invasive potential , may be one of the facilitating factors for tumor invasion and be responsible from suppression of NK cells . Withdrawal of NK cells in the high invasive tumor areas also reminds the necessity of certain shared genetic rearrangements in tumor cells for getting protected from NK cell attacks and moving ahead within the extracellular matrix .
The transcription factor NF-kappaB is constitutively active in pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Here we explore the contribution of NF-kappaB to the malignant phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells in addition to its anti-apoptotic role . Block of NF-kappaB signalling by non-destructible IkappaBalpha rendered cells resistant to TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . In contrast , NF-kappaB activation by TNF-alpha or expression of constitutively active IKK2 induced an EMT-phenotype with up-regulation of vimentin and ZEB1 , and down-regulation of E-cadherin . EMT could also be induced in cells with defective TGF-beta signalling . Functional assays demonstrated reduced or strongly enhanced migration and invasion upon NF-kappaB inhibition or activation , respectively .
BACKGROUND Autotaxin ( ATX ) is an extracellular lysophospholipase D that generates lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) from lysophosphatidylcholine ( LPC ) . Both ATX and LPA have been shown to be involved in many cancers . However , the functional role of ATX and the regulation of ATX expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) remain elusive . RESULTS In this study , ATX expression was evaluated in tissues from 38 human HCC and 10 normal control subjects . ATX was detected mainly in tumor cells within tissue sections and its over-expression in HCC was specifically correlated with inflammation and liver cirrhosis . In addition , ATX expression was examined in normal human hepatocytes and liver cancer cell lines . Hepatoma Hep3B and Huh7 cells displayed stronger ATX expression than hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells and normal hepatocytes did . Proinflammtory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) promoted ATX expression and secretion selectively in Hep3B and Huh7 cells , which led to a corresponding increase in lysophospholipase-D activity . Moreover , we explored the mechanism governing the expression of ATX in hepatoma cells and established a critical role of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) in basal and TNF-alpha induced ATX expression . Further study showed that secreted enzymatically active ATX stimulated Hep3B cell invasion . CONCLUSIONS This report highlights for the first time the clinical and biological evidence for the involvement of ATX in human HCC . Our observation that links the TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB axis and the ATX-LPA signaling pathway suggests that ATX is likely playing an important role in inflammation related liver tumorigenesis .
OBJECTIVE To study the clinicopathologic features , immunophenotype and ultrastructural features of sinonasal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors ( IMT ) . METHODS The clinical and histologic features of 5 cases of sinonasal IMT were reviewed . Immunohistochemical study for vimentin , MSA , SMA , calponin , h-caldesmon , desmin , ALK , fibronectin , CK , S-100 and Ki-67 was carried out . Ultrastructural examination was also performed in two of the cases . RESULTS The patients age ranged from 28 to 62 years ( mean = 43 years ) . The male-to-female ratio was 2:3 . The clinical presentation included nasal obstruction , nasal discharge , nasal bleeding , facial pain , facial swelling , toothache and tear overflow . All of the 5 patients suffered from disease relapses ; and 4 of them had recurrences for more than 5 times . One patient had lymph node metastasis and 3 patients died of the disease . Histologically , the tumor cells were arranged in interlacing fascicles and sometimes haphazard in fashion . They were spindly in shape , cytoplasm eosinophilic with mild nuclear atypia and a low mitotic activity . The intervening stroma was myxoid in appearance accompanied by lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration , abundant blood vessels and focal collagenized areas . In 3 of the recurrent cases , the tumor cells displayed increased nuclear atypia and mitotic activity ( average about 5 to 6 per 10 high-power fields ) , accompanied by patchy necrosis , less inflammatory cell infiltration and focal sarcomatous changes . Immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for vimentin . SMA , MSA , calponin and fibronectin were variably expressed . Desmin was weakly positive in 1 case . The staining for h-caldesmon , ALK , S-100 and CK was negative . The Ki-67 proliferation index increased with tumor recurrences . Electron microscopy revealed abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and dense body formation in the cytoplasm . There were an increased amount of collagen fibers in the stroma . CONCLUSIONS IMT rarely occurs in nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses . The tumor is prone to local invasion and recurrences , with subsequent progression to frank malignancy and distant metastasis , resulting in high mortality and poor prognosis . Complete surgical resection remains the main modality of treatment .
BACKGROUND The most deadly form of cancer is not lung or colon , breast or prostate ; it is any cancer that has become metastatic . Mortality due to metastatic melanoma , one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers , has increased steadily over the last several decades . Unfortunately , the arsenal of chemotherapeutic agents available today is most often unsuccessful at extending and improving the life expectancy of afflicted individuals . We sought to identify an effective and nontoxic agent against metastatic melanoma . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We chose to study Cloudman S-91 mouse melanoma cells ( sub-clone M3 , CCL53.1 ) because these cells are highly aggressive and metastatic , representing one of the deadliest types of cancer . Melanoma cells also had an experimental advantage because their morphology , which is easily monitored , relates to the physiology of metastatic cells and normal melanocytes . We chose to test methyl sulfone as a chemotherapeutic agent for two reasons . Because of its chemical structure , we speculated a potential anti-cancer activity by targeting microtubules . Equally important , methyl sulfone has a well-established safety profile in humans . Surprisingly , we found that malignant melanoma cells exposed to methyl sulfone demonstrated the loss of phenotypes characteristic of malignant cells , and the reemergence of phenotypes characteristic of healthy melanocytes . Briefly , over time methyl sulfone induced contact inhibition , loss of ability to migrate through an extracellular matrix , loss of anchorage-independent growth , proper wound healing followed by contact inhibition , irreversible senescence followed by arborization with melanosomes in arbors as seen in normal melanocytes . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Methyl sulfone may have clinical potential as a non-toxic agent effective against metastatic melanoma . Additionally , methyl sulfone has promise as a tool to explore molecular mechanisms of metastatic transformation as well as fundamental processes such as cell migration , contact inhibition , wound healing and cellular senescence .
Application of adenovirus vectors ( Adv ) in metastatic cancer treatment is limited . We previously demonstrated that covalent conjugation of polyethleneglycol ( PEG ) to Adv enhances therapeutic effects and decreases toxic side-effects after systemic administration , but the level of immune response to PEGylated Adv ( PEG-Ad ) was not examined . Here , we examined the effect of PEGylation of Adv on the production of anti-Adv antibodies and antitumor response . We constructed a set of PEG-Ad using 5-kDa PEG , with modification rates of 30% , 45% and 90% . After systemic administration of Advs to rats , we examined the level of anti-Adv immunoglobulin ( Ig)G and IgM in serum . The levels of anti-Adv IgG and anti-Adv IgM in rats treated with unmodified Adv were higher than those in control group . Rats treated with PEG-Ad that had a 90% modification rate showed lower level of anti-Adv IgG and anti-Adv IgM than those treated with unmodified Adv , whereas rats treated with PEG-Ad that had a 30% or 45% modification rate showed a similar level of anti-Adv IgG and IgM to those treated with unmodified Adv. Systemic administration of PEG-Ad that had a 90% modification rate , and expressed tumor necrosis factor-alpha , significantly reduced the number of metastatic colonies in the lung compared to unmodified Adv , with negligible side effects . These results suggest that systemic administration of PEG-Ad with an appropriate PEG modification rate has the potential to reduce the production of antibodies against Adv and increase the therapeutic response against metastatic cancer .
Cytokeratin ( CK ) 19-positive hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) has been reported to have a poor prognosis . The mechanism of the development of CK19-positive HCC remains to be studied . To clarify this , in vitro experiments were performed using human HCC cell lines ( PLC-5 , HepG2 ) , and the phenotypic changes after stimulation with several growth factors were examined using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR , western blotting , and immunofluorescence staining . In vivo experiments using human HCC specimens obtained from a total of 78 patients and clinicopathological analysis were also performed . Among the growth factors tested , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) had prominent effects on inducing CK19 expression in PLC-5 and HepG2 , which was accompanied by the reduced expression of alpha-fetoprotein in PLC-5 . The induction of CK19 expression after EGF stimulation was accompanied by the phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase ( JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase , which was blocked by the addition of JNK inhibitors . EGF also increased proliferative abilities and invasive properties of the HCC cell lines . In vivo , 9 ( 12% ) of 78 HCC cases showed positive immunohistochemical staining of CK19 . The extent of positive immunohistochemical signals of EGF , EGF receptor ( EGFR ) , and JNK expression was significantly intense in CK-19-positive HCC than those of CK19-negative HCC . Clinicopathological analysis showed that CK19-positive HCC had a high incidence of portal vein invasion , extrahepatic metastasis and an early relapse , which was associated with the worsened 2-year disease free survival . These results indicate that the activation of the EGF-EGFR signaling pathway is associated with the development of CK19-positive HCC , and the EGF-induced increase in growth abilities of HCC may account for the poor prognosis of the patients .
INTRODUCTION IkappaB Kinase epsilon ( IKKepsilon ) is a member of the IKK family which plays an important role in the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) . Overexpressed in over 30% of breast cancers , IKKepsilon has been recently identified as a potential breast cancer oncogene . The purpose of this study is to examine the therapeutic potential of IKKepsilon siRNA on human breast cancer cells . METHODS Eight siRNAs targeting different regions of the IKKepsilon mRNA were designed , and the silencing effect was screened by quantitative real time RT-PCR . The biological effects of synthetic siRNAs on human breast cancer cells were investigated by examining the cell proliferation , migration , invasion , focus formation , anchorage-independent growth(via soft agar assay ) , cell cycle arrest , apoptosis ( via annexing binding ) , NF-kappaB basal level , and NF-kappaB related gene expressions upon the IKKepsilon silencing . RESULTS Silencing of IKKepsilon in human breast cancer cells resulted in decrease of focus formation potential and clonogenicity as well as in vitro cell migration/invasion capabilities . Moreover , knockdown of IKKepsilon suppressed cell proliferation . Cell cycle assay showed that the anti-proliferation effect of IKKepsilon siRNA was mediated by arresting cells in G(0)/G(1) phase , which was caused by down-regulation of cyclin D(1) . Furthermore , we demonstrated that silencing of IKKepsilon inhibited the NF-kappaB basal activity as well as the Bcl-2 expression . Significant apoptosis was not observed in breast cancer cells upon the silencing of IKKepsilon . The present study provided the first evidence that silencing IKKepsilon using synthetic siRNA could inhibit the invasiveness properties and proliferation of breast cancer cells . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggested that silencing IKKepsilon using synthetic siRNA may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for breast cancer .
BACKGROUND Apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 ( ASPP ) family members can stimulate the apoptotic function of p53 but have no impact on its cell cycle arrest function . MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression pattern of the ASPP family consisting of ASPP1 , ASPP2 , and iASPP was examined by immunohistochemistry in 45 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma ( EEA ) specimens and 26 normal endometrial tissue ( NET ) samples . RESULTS The expression rates of ASPP1 and ASPP2 in EEA were significantly lower than those in NET ( p < 0.05 ) . However , the iASPP expression rate in EEA was statistically higher in contrast to NET ( p < 0.05 ) . Expression of ASPP1 and iASPP in EEA had no correlation with any clinicopathological features ( p > 0.05). iASPP was associated with grade , invasion , and lymph node metastasis ( p < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS It is a novel finding that the expression pattern of the ASPP family members has respective pathological and clinical implications in EEA , and iASPP might be a candidate target for EEA therapy .
BACKGROUND/AIMS We investigated whether the anticancer drug Ukrain ( UK ) is able to modulate the expression of some of the key markers of tumor progression in pancreatic cell carcinoma , in order to assess its potential therapeutic effect . METHODS Three cell lines ( HPAF-II , PL45 , HPAC ) were treated with UK ( 5 , 10 and 20 muM ) for 48 h , or left untreated . Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine ( SPARC ) mRNA levels were assessed by real-time PCR . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP)-2 and -9 activity was analyzed by SDS zymography ; SPARC protein levels in cell lysates and supernatants were determined by Western blot . Cell cycle was determined by flow cytometric analysis , and invasion by matrigel invasion assay . RESULTS UK down-regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 , suggesting that UK may decrease pancreatic cancer cell invasion , as confirmed by the matrigel invasion assay . SPARC protein down-regulation in supernatants points to an inhibition by UK of extracellular matrix remodeling in the tumor microenvironment . At the same time , SPARC mRNA and cellular protein level up-regulation suggests that UK can affect cell proliferation by cell cycle inhibition , showing a cell cycle G2/M arrest in UK-treated cells . CONCLUSION Our results suggest that UK modulates two major aspects involved in tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer cells , such as extracellular matrix remodeling and cell proliferation .
HGF signaling induces epithelial cells to disassemble cadherin-based adhesion and increase cell motility and invasion , a process termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . EMT plays a major role in cancer metastasis , allowing individual cells to detach from the primary tumor , invade local tissue , and colonize distant tissues with new tumors . While invasion of vascular and lymphatic networks is the predominant route of metastasis , nerves also can act as networks for dissemination of cancer cell to distant sites in a process termed perineual invasion ( PNI ) . Signaling between nerves and invasive cancer cells remains poorly understood , as does cellular decision making that selects the specific route of invasion . Here we examine how HGF signaling contributes to PNI using reductionist culture model systems . We find that TGFbeta , produced by PC12 cells , enhances scattering in response to HGF stimulation , increasing both cell-cell junction disassembly and cell migration . Further , gradients of TGFbeta induce migratory mesenchymal cells to undergo chemotaxis towards the source of TGFbeta . Interestingly , VEGF suppresses TGFbeta-induced enhancement of scattering . These results have broad implications for how combinatorial growth factor signaling contributes to cancer metastasis , suggesting that VEGF and TGFbeta might modulate HGF signaling to influence route selection during cancer progression .
Metastatic cancer cells typically fail to halt migration on contact with non-cancer cells . This invasiveness is in contrast to normal mesenchymal cells that retract on contact with another cell . Why cancer cells are defective in contact inhibition of locomotion is not understood . Here , we analyse the dynamics of prostate cancer cell lines co-cultured with fibroblasts , and demonstrate that a combinatorial code of Eph receptor activation dictates whether cell migration will be contact inhibited . The unimpeded migration of metastatic PC-3 cells towards fibroblasts is dependent on activation of EphB3 and EphB4 by ephrin-B2 , which we show activates Cdc42 and cell migration . Knockdown of EphB3 and EphB4 restores contact inhibition of locomotion to PC-3 cells . Conversely , homotypic collisions between two cancer cells results in contact inhibition of locomotion , mediated by EphA-Rho-Rho kinase ( ROCK ) signalling . Thus , the migration of cancer cells can switch from restrained to invasive , depending on the Eph-receptor profile of the cancer cell and the reciprocal ephrin ligands expressed by neighbouring cells .
BACKGROUND Adult human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSC ) have been shown to home to sites of carcinoma and affect biological processes , including tumour growth and metastasis . Previous findings have been conflicting and a clear understanding of the effects of hMSCs on cancer remains to be established . Therefore , we set out to investigate the impact of hMSCs on the oestrogen receptor positive , hormone-dependent breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 . RESULTS In this study , we show the effects of hMSCs on cancer cells are mediated through a secreted factor(s) which are enhanced by cancer cell-hMSC contact/communication . In addition to enhanced proliferation when in co-culture with hMSCs , MCF-7 cells were found to have increased migration potential in vitro . Inhibition of ER signalling by the pure anti-oestrogen ICI 182,780 decreased the effect of hMSCs on MCF-7 cell proliferation and migration supporting a role for ER signalling in the hMSC/MCF-7 cell interaction . Additionally , hMSCs have been shown to secrete a wide variety of growth factors and chemokines including stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( SDF-1 ) . This coupled with the knowledge that SDF-1 is an ER-mediated gene linked with hormone-independence and metastasis led to the investigation of the SDF-1/CXCR4 signalling axis in hMSC-MCF-7 cell interaction . Experiments revealed an increase in SDF-1 gene expression both in vivo and in vitro when MCF-7 cells were cultured with hMSCs . SDF-1 treatment of MCF-7 cells alone increased proliferation to just below that seen with hMSC co-culture . Additionally , blocking SDF-1 signalling using a CXCR4-specific inhibitor decreased hMSC induced proliferation and migration of MCF-7 . However , the combined treatment of ICI and AMD3100 reduced MCF-7 cell proliferation and migration below control levels , indicating targeting both the ER and CXCR4 pathways is effective in decreasing the hMSCs induction of MCF-7 cell proliferation and migration . CONCLUSIONS The sum of these data reveals the relationship between tumour microenvironment and tumour growth and progression . Better understanding of the mechanisms involved in this tumour stroma cell interaction may provide novel targets for the development of treatment strategies for oestrogen receptor positive , hormone-independent , and endocrine-resistant breast carcinoma .
Monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) to HER2 are currently used to treat breast cancer , but low clinical efficacy , along with primary and acquired resistance to therapy , commonly limit clinical applications . We previously reported that combinations of antibodies directed at non-overlapping epitopes of HER2 are endowed with enhanced antitumor effects , probably due to accelerated receptor degradation . Here , we extend these observations to three-dimensional mammary cell models , and compare the effects of single mAbs with the effects of antibody combinations . Collectively , our in vitro assays and computational image analyses indicate that combining mAbs against different epitopes of HER2 better inhibits invasive growth . Importantly , while growth factors are able to reduce intraluminal apoptosis and induce an invasive phenotype , combinations of mAbs better than single mAbs can reverse the growth factor-induced phenotypes of HER2-overexpressing spheroids . In conclusion , our studies propose that mAb combinations negate the biological effects of growth factors on invasive growth of HER2-overexpressing cells . Hence , combining mAbs offers a therapeutic strategy , potentially able to enhance clinical efficacy of existing antireceptor immunotherapeutics .
PURPOSE BMP-6 , which belongs to the TGF-beta superfamily , is a multifunctional molecule with distinct abilities in embryogenesis and organogenesis . Our recent research has implied that BMP-6 may suppress breast cancer metastasis . In the present study , we extended to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which BMP-6 exerts its anti-tumorigenic effect . METHODS The Boyden chamber assay was used to examine the ability of BMP-6 and HO-1 in MCF-7 malignant progress . RT-PCR , western blot , luciferase assay , and quantitative CHIP were used to determine the potential mechanism and signaling pathways by which BMP-6 and HO-1 function as anti-metastatic factors in MCF-7 cells . RESULTS The Boyden chamber assay showed that BMP-6 inhibited the migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells , which effect was significantly deprived by knockdown of HO-1 . We further demonstrated that BMP-6 treatment resulted in an activation of HO-1 transcription through the recruitment of Smad1/5 to the Smad-responsive element on its promoter . In addition , BMP-6-induced up-regulation of HO-1 exhibited an inhibitory effect on MMP-9 secretion in a paracrine action in MCF-7 cells . Overexpression of BMP-6 and HO-1 synergistically suppressed MMP-9 transcription , which effect was specifically mediated via the MAPK/p38/AP-1 signaling . However , blockade of HO-1 using ZnPPIX totally abolished BMP-6-regulated MMP-9 activation in MCF-7 cells . CONCLUSIONS These observations suggest a novel role of BMP-6/HO-1 cascade to relieve breast cancer metastasis by regulating the secretion of growth factors in tumor microenvironment .
Bone is the second most common metastatic site in patients with renal cell carcinoma presenting with metastases ( mRCC ) at diagnosis . Complications of metastatic bone disease , including bone pain , fractures , spinal cord compression , and hypercalcaemia , are the primary cause of decline in the quality of life of patients with mRCC . Currently , treatment for mRCC bone metastases is generally palliative . Bisphosphonates are also used ; however , the efficacy of bisphosphonates in conjunction with targeted agents is currently unknown . As growth factors play a critical role in the development of bone metastases , there is a biological rationale for the use of targeted agents to treat them . We report here the case of two patients with mRCC with surgically unresectable sacral bone metastases treated with sunitinib , who are still alive with long-term stabilization of metastases of 48 and 31 months . Results suggest targeted agents such as sunitinib may be an effective treatment for bone metastases .
E6-associated protein ( E6-AP ) is a dual function protein . It acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase enzyme and coactivator of steroid hormone receptors such as estrogen ( ERalpha ) and progesterone ( PR ) receptors . It promotes the degradation of ERalpha and PR through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway . Furthermore , it has been shown that the levels of E6-AP are inversely associated with that of ERalpha in human breast tumors . But the role of wild-type human E6-AP and its ubiquitin-protein ligase activity in mammary tumorigenesis is still unknown . To investigate this role , the authors utilized transgenic mice lines that specifically overexpress either the wild-type human E6-AP ( E6-AP(WT) ) or the ubiquitin-protein ligase defective E6-AP that contains C833S mutation ( E6-AP(C833S) ) in the mammary gland . To further substantiate the role of E6-AP in the development of breast tumorigenesis , it was also examined the expression of E6-AP in a large cohort of human breast cancer samples . The transgenic mice that overexpress wild-type E6-AP ( E6-AP(WT) ) fail to develop mammary tumors . Unlike the E6-AP(WT) mice , the E6-AP(C833S) mice that overexpress ubiquitin-protein ligase defective E6-AP protein develop mammary hyperplasia with a median latency of 18months . These observations suggest that the inactivation of the ubiquitin-protein ligase function of E6-AP is sufficient to initiate the process of mammary tumor development . Furthermore , the data also suggests that E6-AP exerts its effects on target cells by modulating the protein levels and functions of ERalpha and PR . In addition , it was found in human breast cancer patients that the level of E6-AP is decreased in invasive breast tumors compared to normal breast tissue . Moreover , the authors also show that the survival patterns for E6-AP negative patients were worse compared to E6-AP positive patients . Taken together , these data suggests that E6-AP may act as a tumor suppressor in breast .
Programmed cell death 6 ( PDCD6 ) was originally found as a pro-apoptotic protein , but its molecular mechanism is not well understood . In this study , we have attempted to investigate the effects of PDCD6 on the inhibition of angiogenesis-mediated cell growth as a novel anti-angiogenic protein . Purified recombinant human PDCD6 inhibited cell migration in a concentration-time-dependent manner . We also found that overexpressed PDCD6 suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-induced proliferation , invasion , and capillary-like structure tube formation in vitro . PDCD6 suppressed phosphorylation of signaling regulators downstream from PI3K , including Akt , mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) , glycogen synthase kinase-3beta(GSK-3beta) , ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( p70S6K ) , and also decreased cyclin D1 expression . We found binding PDCD6 to VEGFR-2 , a key player in the PI3K/mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway . Taken together , these data suggest that PDCD6 plays a significant role in modulating cellular angiogenesis .
We recently isolated an exon-4-deleted epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) variant , termed de4 EGFR . Because the extracellular domain alteration of receptors often influences the antitumor effect of therapeutic antibodies , it is essential to test the sensitivity of de4 EGFR(+) tumors to anti-EGFR antibodies . Therefore , in this study , the antitumor activities of mAb CH12 , an anti-EGFRvIII antibody developed in our laboratory , as well as a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-EGFR antibody , cetuximab ( C225 ) , were characterized on de4 EGFR(+) models . The results of FACS assays showed that CH12 bound to de4 EGFR with a higher avidity than did C225 . Interestingly , CH12 , but not C225 , significantly inhibited the metastasis and growth of U87MG-de4 EGFR xenografts , with a growth-inhibition ratio of 46.48% in vivo , and prolonged the survival of the tumor-bearing mice by 37.2% . Treatment with CH12 significantly suppressed tumor proliferation and angiogenesis with increased tumor apoptosis . Mechanistically , de4 EGFR protein expression was virtually undetectable in the U87MG-de4 EGFR xenografts treated with CH12 . This may account for the observed reduction of Akt and Erk phosphorylation , cyclin D1 , Bcl-2 , and Bcl-x(L) expression and the increase of p27 and E-cadherin expression . Intriguingly , LAMP-1 , a major component of the lysosome , was significantly up-regulated in the CH12-treated group but not in the C225-treated group , suggesting its contribution to the degradation of de4 EGFR . Taken together , our data demonstrated that mAb CH12 is a promising therapeutic agent for treating de4 EGFR(+) gliomas .
Thyroid hormone ( T(3) ) mediates cellular growth , development , and differentiation by binding to the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor ( TR ) . Recent studies suggest that long-term hypothyroidism is associated with human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) independent from other major HCC risk factors . Dickkopf ( DKK ) 4 , a secreted protein , antagonizes the Wnt signal pathway . In this study , we demonstrate that T(3) may play a suppressor role by inducing DKK4 expression in HCC cells at both the messenger RNA ( mRNA ) and protein levels . DKK4 was down-regulated in 67.5% of HCC cancerous tissues . The decrease in DKK4 levels was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in TR protein levels in the matched cancerous tissues in 31% of tissues compared by immunoblotting with the adjacent noncancerous tissues . Further , TR and DKK4 expression levels were positively correlated in both normal and cancerous specimens by tissue array analysis . In function assays , stable DKK4 transfected into J7 or HepG2 cells decreased cell invasion in vitro . Conversely , knocking down DKK4 restores cell invasiveness . DKK4-expressing J7 clones showed increased degradation of beta-catenin , but down-regulation of CD44 , cyclin D1 , and c-Jun . To investigate the effect of DKK4 and TR on tumor growth in vivo , we established a xenograft of J7 cells in nude mice . J7-DKK4 and J7-TRalpha1 overexpressing mice , which displayed growth arrest , lower lung colony formation index , and smaller tumor size than in control mice , supporting an inhibitory role of DKK4 in tumor progression . CONCLUSION : Taken together , these data suggest that the TR/DKK4/Wnt/beta-catenin cascade influences the proliferation and migration of hepatoma cells during the metastasis process and support a tumor suppressor role of the TR .
Nitric oxide ( NO ) shows tumoricidal activity . We had previously reported that NO downregulates the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway , but upregulates the MEK/ERK pathway downstream of growth factor signaling . We hypothesized that NO donor and MEK inhibitor in combination synergistically inhibit the viability of cancer cells compared to either NO donor or MEK inhibitor alone . We determined the effects of S-nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO , NO-donor ) and U0126 ( MEK inhibitor ) on insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) signaling , proliferation and invasion in cancer cell lines . GSNO inhibits phosphorylation of IGF-I receptor ( IGF-IR ) , EGF receptor ( EGFR ) and Akt , but upregulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in MIAPaCa-2 and HCT-116 cells after stimulation by IGF-I and EGF . On the other hand , U0126 inhibits phosphorylation of ERK1/2 , but upregulates phosphorylation of IGF-IR and EGFR in MIAPaCa-2 and HCT-116 cells . The combination of GSNO and U0126 downregulates phosphorylation of IGF-IR , EGFR , Akt and ERK1/2 after stimulation by IGF-I and EGF . GSNO as well as U0126 , inhibits the proliferation of MIAPaCa-2 , HCT-116 , Panc-1 , MCF-7 , HT-29 and AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner . GSNO and U0126 in combination synergistically inhibit proliferation and invasion of cancer cells . These results indicate that the combined treatment of NO donor and MEK inhibitor may be promising in cancer therapy .
Androgen deprivation is currently a standard-of-care , first-line therapy for prostate cancer in the United States . Although this regimen effectively regresses androgen-dependent disease , relapse often occurs in an androgen-independent manner and is associated with poor prognosis . Such castration-resistant prostate cancer represents a major clinical challenge , and the mechanisms underlying castration resistance are not fully understood . Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a key developmental process and has also been implicated in cancer metastasis and therapeutic resistance in recent years . However , the factors contributing to EMT in human cancers remain unclear . Here , we show that both normal mouse prostate tissue and human LuCaP35 prostate tumor explants display an EMT as well as increased stem cell-like features following androgen deprivation . Importantly , we observed similar changes in mesenchymal features in prostate tumors from patients treated with androgen-deprivation therapy . In addition , we have delineated a feedback loop involving the androgen receptor and the Zeb1 transcription factor that seems to mediate this transition . In summary , we show for the first time that androgen deprivation induces EMT in both normal prostate and prostate cancer , revealing a potentially important consequence of a standard-of-care treatment for prostate cancer . This finding could have significant implications for second-line treatment strategies in this clinical setting .
Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR-TKIs ) show dramatic antitumor activity in a subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have an active mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene . On the other hand , some lung cancer patients with wild type EGFR also respond to EGFR-TKIs , suggesting that EGFR-TKIs have an effect on host cells as well as tumor cells . However , the effect of EGFR-TKIs on host microenvironments is largely unknown . A multiple organ metastasis model was previously established in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient mice using human lung cancer cells . This model was used to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of erlotinib , an EGFR-TKI , on multiple organ metastases induced by human small cell lung cancer cells ( SBC-5 cells ) that did not express EGFR . Although erlotinib did not have any effect on the proliferation of SBC-5 cells in vitro , it significantly suppressed bone and lung metastases in vivo , but not liver metastases . An immunohistochemical analysis revealed that , erlotinib significantly suppressed the number of osteoclasts in bone metastases , whereas no difference was seen in microvessel density . Moreover , erlotinib inhibited EGF-induced receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B expression in an osteoblastic cell line ( MC3T3-E1 cells ) . These results strongly suggested that erlotinib prevented bone metastases by affecting host microenvironments irrespective of its direct effect on tumor cells .
BACKGROUND The receptor tyrosine kinase family includes many transmembrane proteins with diverse physiological and pathophysiological functions . The involvement of tyrosine kinase signaling in promoting a more aggressive tumor phenotype within the context of chemotherapeutic evasion is gaining recognition . The Ron receptor is a tyrosine kinase receptor that has been implicated in the progression of breast cancer and evasion of tamoxifen therapy . RESULTS Here , we report that Ron expression is correlated with in situ , estrogen receptor alpha ( ERalpha)-positive tumors , and is higher in breast tumors following neoadjuvant tamoxifen therapy . We also demonstrate that the majority of mammary tumors isolated from transgenic mice with mammary specific-Ron overexpression ( MMTV-Ron mice ) , exhibit appreciable ER expression . Moreover , genetic-ablation of ERalpha , in the context of Ron overexpression , leads to delayed mammary tumor initiation and growth , but also results in an increased metastasis . CONCLUSIONS Ron receptor overexpression is associated with ERalpha-positive human and murine breast tumors . In addition , loss of ERalpha on a Ron overexpressing background in mice leads to the development of breast tumors which grow slower but which exhibit more metastasis and suggests that targeting of ERalpha , as in the case of tamoxifen therapy , may reduce the growth of Ron overexpressing breast cancers but may cause these tumors to be more metastatic .
Cancer cells universally increase glucose and glutamine consumption , leading to the altered metabolic state known as the Warburg effect ; one metabolic pathway , highly dependent on glucose and glutamine , is the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway . Increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway leads to increases in the post-translational addition of O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine ( O-GlcNAc ) to various nuclear and cytosolic proteins . A number of these target proteins are implicated in cancer , and recently , O-GlcNAcylation was shown to play a role in breast cancer ; however , O-GlcNAcylation in other cancers remains poorly defined . Here , we show that O-GlcNAc transferase ( OGT ) is overexpressed in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate epithelium and that OGT protein and O-GlcNAc levels are elevated in prostate carcinoma cell lines . Reducing O-GlcNAcylation in PC3-ML cells was associated with reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-2 , MMP-9 , and VEGF , resulting in inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis . OGT-mediated regulation of invasion and angiogenesis was dependent upon regulation of the oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1 , a key regulator of invasion and angiogenesis , as reducing OGT expression led to increased FoxM1 protein degradation . Conversely , overexpression of a degradation-resistant FoxM1 mutant abrogated OGT RNAi-mediated effects on invasion , MMP levels , angiogenesis , and VEGF expression . Using a mouse model of metastasis , we found that reduction of OGT expression blocked bone metastasis . Altogether , these data suggest that as prostate cancer cells alter glucose and glutamine levels , O-GlcNAc modifications and OGT levels become elevated and are required for regulation of malignant properties , implicating OGT as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cancer .
BACKGROUND Epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is known to be associated with chemoresistance as well as increased invasion/metastasis . However , the relationship between EMT and resistance to an epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) -targeting drug in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) remains unknown . In this study , we investigated the acquisition of EMT by gefitinib in HNSCC cell line ( UMSCC81B ) . METHODS We isolated fibroblastoid variant ( 81B-Fb ) from gefitinib-resistant UMSCC81B-GR3 cells obtained after increasing the doses of gefitinib treatment in vitro and examined EMT and its underlying mechanism . RESULT 81B-Fb cells exhibited fibroblast-like morphology , increased motility , loss of E-cadherin , acquisition of vimentin and snail expression . In 81B-Fb cells , downregulation of EGFR , which is mediated by increased ubiquitination , and activation of downstream protein kinase B ( Akt ) , glycogen synthase kinase-beta ( GSK-3beta ) signalling and upregulation of snail expression were observed compared with UMSCC81B cells . LY294002 , but not U0126 , suppressed foetal bovine serum or heregulin-beta1-induced phosphorylation of Akt/GSK-3beta and snail expression together with the inhibition of 81B-Fb cell motility . Furthermore , forced expression of EGFR resulted in partial restoration of gefitinib sensitivity and reversal of EMT . CONCLUSION These results suggest that EMT in the gefitinib-resistant cells is mediated by the downregulation of EGFR and compensatory activation of Akt/GSK-3beta/snail pathway .
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with the high risk of colon cancer and a variety of other diseases . The active vitamin D metabolite 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) ( 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) ) regulates gene transcription via its nuclear receptor ( VDR ) , and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of gene expression have also been proposed . We have identified microRNA-22 ( miR-22 ) and several other miRNA species as 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) targets in human colon cancer cells . Remarkably , miR-22 is induced by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in a time- , dose- and VDR-dependent manner . In SW480-ADH and HCT116 cells , miR-22 loss-of-function by transfection of a miR-22 inhibitor suppresses the antiproliferative effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) . Additionally , miR-22 inhibition increases cell migration per se and decreases the antimigratory effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in both cell types . In silico analysis shows a significant overlap between genes suppressed by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and miR-22 putative target genes . Consistently , miR-22 inhibition abrogates the 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated suppression of NELL2 , OGN , HNRPH1 , RERE and NFAT5 genes . In 39 out of 50 ( 78% ) human colon cancer patients , miR-22 expression was found lower in the tumour than in the matched normal tissue and correlated directly with that of VDR . Our results indicate that miR-22 is induced by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in human colon cancer cells and it may contribute to its antitumour action against this neoplasia .
Epidemiological studies have indicated that obesity is associated with colorectal cancer . The obesity hormone leptin is considered as a key mediator for cancer development and progression . The present study aims to investigate regulatory effects of leptin on colorectal carcinoma . The expression of leptin and its receptor Ob-R was examined by immunohistochemistry in 108 Chinese patients with colorectal carcinoma . The results showed that leptin/Ob-R expression was significantly associated with T stage , TNM stage , lymph node metastasis , distant metastasis , differentiation and expression of p-mTOR , p-70S6 kinase , and p-Akt . Furthermore , the effects of leptin on proliferation and apoptosis of HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells were determined . The results showed that leptin could stimulate the proliferation and inhibit the apoptosis of HCT-116 colon cells through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway . Ly294002 ( a PI3K inhibitor ) and rapamycin ( an mTOR inhibitor ) could prevent the regulatory effects of leptin on the proliferation and apoptosis of HCT-116 cells via abrogating leptin-mediated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway . All these results indicated that leptin could regulate proliferation and apoptosis of colorectal carcinoma through the PI3K/Akt/ mTOR signalling pathway .
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) is the most common pathological subtype of kidney cancer . Here , we integrated an unbiased genome-wide RNA interference screen for ccRCC survival regulators with an analysis of recurrently overexpressed genes in ccRCC to identify new therapeutic targets in this disease . One of the most potent survival regulators , the monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 ( SLC16A3 ) , impaired ccRCC viability in all eight ccRCC lines tested and was the seventh most overexpressed gene in a meta-analysis of five ccRCC expression datasets . MCT4 silencing impaired secretion of lactate generated through glycolysis and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis . Silencing MCT4 resulted in intracellular acidosis , and reduction in intracellular ATP production together with partial reversion of the Warburg effect in ccRCC cell lines . Intra-tumoural heterogeneity in the intensity of MCT4 protein expression was observed in primary ccRCCs . MCT4 protein expression analysis based on the highest intensity of expression in primary ccRCCs was associated with poorer relapse-free survival , whereas modal intensity correlated with Fuhrman nuclear grade . Consistent with the potential selection of subclones enriched for MCT4 expression during disease progression , MCT4 expression was greater at sites of metastatic disease . These data suggest that MCT4 may serve as a novel metabolic target to reverse the Warburg effect and limit disease progression in ccRCC .
The progression of prostate cancers ( PCs ) to locally invasive , androgen-independent and metastatic disease states is generally associated with treatment resistance and disease relapse . The present study was undertaken to establish the possibility of using a combination of specific oncogenic products , including epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , pAkt , nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 ( MIC-1 ) as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for optimizing the management of patients with localized PC at earlier disease stages . The immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence data have revealed that the expression levels of EGFR , Ser(473)-pAkt , NF-kappaB p65 and MIC-1 proteins were significantly enhanced in the same subset of 76 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma specimens during the disease progression and these biomarkers were expressed in a small subpopulation of CD133(+) PC cells and the bulk tumor mass of CD133(-) PC cells . Importantly , all of these biomarkers were also overexpressed in 80-100% of 30 PC metastasis bone tissue specimens . Moreover , the results have indicated that the EGF-EGFR signaling pathway can provide critical functions for the self-renewal of side population ( SP ) cells endowed with stem cell-like features from highly invasive WPE1-NB26 cells . Of therapeutic interest , the targeting of EGFR , pAkt , NF-kappaB or MIC-1 was also effective at suppressing the basal and EGF-promoted prostasphere formation by SP WPE1-NB26 cells , inducing disintegration of SP cell-derived prostaspheres and decreasing the viability of SP and non-SP WPE1-NB26 cell fractions . Also , the targeting of these oncogenic products induced the caspase-dependent apoptosis in chemoresistant SP WPE1-NB26 cells and enhanced their sensibility to the cytotoxic effects induced by docetaxel . These findings suggest that the combined use of EGFR , pAkt , NF-kappaB and/or MIC-1 may represent promising strategies for improving the accuracy of current diagnostic and prognostic methods and efficacy of treatments of PC patients in considering the disease heterogeneity , thereby preventing PC progression to metastatic and lethal disease states .
We have recently proposed a new two-compartment model for understanding the Warburg effect in tumor metabolism . In this model , glycolytic stromal cells produce mitochondrial fuels ( L-lactate and ketone bodies ) that are then transferred to oxidative epithelial cancer cells , driving OXPHOS and mitochondrial metabolism . Thus , stromal catabolism fuels anabolic tumor growth via energy transfer . We have termed this new cancer paradigm the " reverse Warburg effect, " because stromal cells undergo aerobic glycolysis , rather than tumor cells . To assess whether this mechanism also applies during cancer cell metastasis , we analyzed the bioenergetic status of breast cancer lymph node metastases , by employing a series of metabolic protein markers . For this purpose , we used MCT4 to identify glycolytic cells . Similarly , we used TO MM20 and COX staining as markers of mitochondrial mass and OXPHOS activity , respectively . Consistent with the " reverse Warburg effect, " our results indicate that metastatic breast cancer cells amplify oxidative mitochondrial metabolism ( OXPHOS ) and that adjacent stromal cells are glycolytic and lack detectable mitochondria . Glycolytic stromal cells included cancer-associated fibroblasts , adipocytes and inflammatory cells . Double labeling experiments with glycolytic ( MCT4 ) and oxidative ( TO MM20 or COX ) markers directly shows that at least two different metabolic compartments co-exist , side-by-side , within primary tumors and their metastases . Since cancer-associated immune cells appeared glycolytic , this observation may also explain how inflammation literally " fuels " tumor progression and metastatic dissemination , by " feeding " mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells . Finally , MCT4(+) and TO MM20(-) " glycolytic " cancer cells were rarely observed , indicating that the conventional " Warburg effect " does not frequently occur in cancer-positive lymph node metastases .
BACKGROUND Estrogen receptor beta ( ERbeta ) is the predominant ER in the colorectal epithelium , whose expression is greatly reduced in colorectal cancer compared with normal colon tissue . Recent in vitro studies suggested that ERbeta may suppress tumor growth . No research was reported whether ERbeta can be used as therapeutic agent for colon cancer . METHODS In this study , ERbeta gene constructed into adenoviral ( Ad ) vectors was used to treat colon cancer HCT-116 cells alone or in combination with raloxifene . In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to investigate the therapeutic effects of ERbeta and raloxifene in HCT-116 cells . RESULTS Our results indicated that , although Ad-ERbeta alone had no effect on the proliferation of HCT-116 cells , the combination of Ad-ERbeta with raloxifene significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCT-116 cells . The apparently apoptotic induction effects may partly explain the cytotoxicity of the two agents . The results of the study of ERbeta on migration and invasion of HCT-116 cells demonstrated that overexpression of ERbeta significantly decreased cell migration and increased invasion of cells . The antitumor efficacies of ERbeta as well as raloxifene were further investigated on HCT-116 tumor bearing mice . Results demonstrated that both Ad-ERbeta and raloxifene individually inhibited tumor growth . The combination group showed the highest inhibitory efficiency compared with other three groups . CONCLUSION These findings demonstrated that combined administration of Ad-ERbeta with raloxifene represents a promising colon cancer therapeutic strategy .
It has been shown that regulation of EGFR expression in prostate cancer cells is mostly at the transcriptional level. microRNA-133 ( miR-133 ) has long been recognized as a muscle-specific miRNA which may regulate myoblast differentiation and participate in many myogenic diseases . Recently , it has been reported that miR-133 is also involved in other tumors , such as bladder cancer , esophageal cancer and may regulate cell motility in these cancer cells . In the present study , we examined the expression and effects of miR-133 in two hormone-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines . The expression of miR-133a and miR-133b were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR . After transfection of miR-133a and miR-133b , cell viability assay , luciferase assay , western blot analysis , cell migration and invasion assay were conducted in Du145 and PC3 cells . In this study , we showed that miR-133a and miR-133b are expressed at the detection limit in two hormone-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines , PC3 and DU145 . Ectopic expression of miR-133 inhibited cell proliferation , migration and invasion in these cells . We also provide the first evidence that miR-133 may target EGFR . Our study provided the first glimpse of the functional role of miR-133 in two hormone-independent prostate cancer cell lines . These results may add to our knowledge on the molecular basis of prostate cancer progression .
Cancer cells exhibit altered glucose metabolism characterized by a preference for aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect , and the cells resist matrix detachment-induced apoptosis , which is called anoikis , a barrier to metastasis . It remains largely unclear whether tumor metabolism influences anoikis and metastasis . Here we show that when detached from the matrix , untransformed mammary epithelial cells undergo metabolic reprogramming by markedly upregulating pyruvate dehydrogenase ( PDH ) kinase 4 ( PDK4 ) through estrogen-related receptor gamma ( ERR\u03b3 ) , thereby inhibiting PDH and attenuating the flux of glycolytic carbon into mitochondrial oxidation . To decipher the significance of this metabolic response , we found that depletion of PDK4 or activation of PDH increased mitochondrial respiration and oxidative stress in suspended cells , resulting in heightened anoikis . Conversely , overexpression of PDKs prolonged survival of cells in suspension . Therefore , decreased glucose oxidation following cell detachment confers anoikis resistance . Unlike untransformed cells , most cancer cells demonstrate reduced glucose oxidation even under attached conditions , and thus they inherently possess a survival advantage when suspended . Normalization of glucose metabolism by stimulating PDH in cancer cells restores their susceptibility to anoikis and impairs their metastatic potential . These results suggest that the Warburg effect , more specifically , diminished glucose oxidation , promotes anoikis resistance and metastasis and that PDKs are potential targets for antimetastasis therapy .
Gastrin stimulates the growth of pancreatic cancer cells through the activation of the cholecystokinin-B receptor ( CCK-BR ) , which has been found to be overexpressed in pancreatic cancer . In this study , we proposed that the CCK-BR drives growth of pancreatic cancer ; hence , interruption of CCK-BR activity could potentially be an ideal target for cancer therapeutics . The effect of CCK-BR downregulation in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells was examined by utilizing specific CCK-BR-targeted RNA interference reagents . The CCK-BR receptor expression was both transiently and stably downregulated by transfection with selective CCK-BR small-interfering RNA or short-hairpin RNA , respectively , and the effects on cell growth and apoptosis were assessed . CCK-BR downregulation resulted in reduced cancer cell proliferation , decreased DNA synthesis , and cell cycle arrest as demonstrated by an inhibition of G(1) to S phase progression . Furthermore , CCK-BR downregulation increased caspase-3 activity , TUNEL-positive cells , and decreased X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression , suggesting apoptotic activity . Pancreatic cancer cell mobility was decreased when the CCK-BR was downregulated , as assessed by a migration assay . These results show the importance of the CCK-BR in regulation of growth and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer . Strategies to decrease the CCK-BR expression and activity may be beneficial for the development of new methods to improve the treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer .
Curcumin , a well-known chemopreventive agent from turmeric , inhibits the expression of several oncogenes and cell proliferation genes in tumor cells . This study aims to understand the precise molecular mechanism by which curcumin exerts its effects on retinoblastoma cells , by performing whole genome microarray analysis to determine the gene expression profiles altered by curcumin treatment . Curcumin suppressed cell viability and altered the cell cycle of retinoblastoma cells . We identified 903 downregulated genes and 1,319 upregulated genes when compared with the control cells after treatment with 20 muM curcumin concentration for 48 h . These genes were grouped into respective functional categories according to their biological function . We found that curcumin regulated the expression of genes that are involved in the regulation of apoptosis , tumor suppressor , cell-cycle arrest , transcription factor , and angiogenesis . Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) analysis was used to validate the results of genome array , and the results were consistent with the obtained data . In conclusion , treatment of curcumin affects the expression of genes involved in various cellular functions and plays an important role in tumor metastasis and apoptosis . Thus , curcumin might be an effective chemopreventive agent for retinoblastoma cancer .
BACKGROUND Brain-metastatic breast cancer ( BMBC ) is increasing and poses a severe clinical problem because of the lack of effective treatments and because the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown . Recent work has demonstrated that deregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) may correlate with BMBC progression . However , the exact contribution that EGFR makes to BMBC remains unclear . METHODS The role of EGFR in BMBC was explored by serial analyses in a brain-trophic clone of human MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells ( 231-BR cells ) . EGFR expression was inhibited by stable short-hairpin RNA transfection or by the kinase inhibitor erlotinib , and it was activated by heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) . Cell growth and invasion activities also were analyzed in vitro and in vivo . RESULTS EGFR inhibition or activation strongly affected 231-BR cell migration/invasion activities as assessed by an adhesion assay , a wound-healing assay , a Boyden chamber invasion assay , and cytoskeleton staining . Also , EGFR inhibition significantly decreased brain metastases of 231-BR cells in vivo . Surprisingly , changes to EGFR expression affected cell proliferation activities less significantly as determined by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay , an anchorage-independent growth assay , and cell cycle analysis . Immunoblot analysis suggested that EGFR drives cells ' invasiveness capability mainly through phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B and phospholipase C gamma downstream pathways . In addition , EGFR was involved less in proliferation because of the insensitivity of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway . CONCLUSIONS The current results indicated that EGFR plays more important roles in cell migration and invasion to the brain than in cell proliferation progression on 231-BR cells , providing new evidence of the potential value of EGFR inhibition in treating BMBC .
The Salmonella type III secretion system ( T3SS ) efficiently translocates heterologous proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells . This leads to an antigen-specific CD8 T-cell induction in mice orally immunized with recombinant Salmonella . Recently , we have used Salmonella's T3SS as a prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against a murine fibrosarcoma . In this study , we constructed a recombinant Salmonella strain translocating the immunogenic H-2D(b)-specific CD8 T-cell epitope VILTNPISM ( KDR2 ) from the murine vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) . VEGFR2 is a member of the tyrosine protein kinase family and is upregulated on proliferating endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature . After single orogastric vaccination , we detected significant numbers of KDR2-tetramer-positive CD8 T cells in the spleens of immunized mice . The efficacy of these cytotoxic T cells was evaluated in a prophylactic setting to protect mice from challenges with B16F10 melanoma cells in a flank tumor model , and to reduce dissemination of spontaneous pulmonary melanoma metastases . Vaccinated mice revealed a reduction of angiogenesis by 62% in the solid tumor and consequently a significant decrease of tumor growth as compared to non-immunized mice . Moreover , in the lung metastasis model , immunization with recombinant Salmonella resulted in a reduction of the metastatic melanoma burden by approximately 60% .
BACKGROUND Recent data indicate the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) pathway is required for VEGF production and angiogenesis in various types of cancers . STAT3 inhibitors have been shown to reduce tumor microvessel density in tumors but a direct anti-angiogenic activity has not been described . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We investigated the direct action of a small molecule inhibitor of STAT3 ( LLL12 ) in human umbilical cord vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) in vitro , in a Matrigel model for angiogenesis in vivo , and its antitumor activity in a xenograft model of osteosarcoma . LLL12 ( 100 nM ) significantly inhibited VEGF-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation in HUVECs , reduced their proliferation/migration and inhibited VEGF-induced tube formation . Morphologic analysis of LLL12 treated HUVECs demonstrated marked changes in actin/tubulin distribution and bundling . In scid mice , LLL12 reduced microvessel invasion into VEGF-infused Matrigel plugs by ~90% at a dose of 5 mg/kg daily . Following a period of tumor progression ( 2 weeks ) , LLL12 completely suppressed further growth of established OS-1 osteosarcoma xenografts . Pharmacodynamic studies showed robust phosphorylated STAT3 in control tumors , whereas phospho-STAT3 was not detected in LLL12-treated OS-1 tumors . Treated tumors demonstrated decreased proliferation ( Ki67 staining ) , and decreased microvessel density ( CD34 staining ) , but no significant increase in apoptosis ( TUNEL staining ) , relative to controls . Assay of angiogenic factors , using an antibody array , showed VEGF , MMP-9 , Angiopoietin1/2 , Tissue Factor and FGF-1 expression were dramatically reduced in LLL12-treated tumors compared to control tumors . CONCLUSIONS These findings provide the first evidence that LLL12 effectively inhibits tumor angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo .
Even when patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer undergo surgical resection at an early stage , recurrent disease often impairs the clinical outcome . There are numerous causes potentially responsible for a relapse of the disease , one of them being extensive angiogenesis . The balance of at least two systems , VEGF VEGFR and Ang Tie , regulates vessel formation . The aim of this study was to determine the impact of surgery on the plasma levels of the main angiogenic factors during the first month after surgery in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients . The study group consisted of 37 patients with stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer . Plasma concentrations of Ang1 , Ang2 , sTie2 , VEGF , and sVEGF R1 were evaluated by ELISA three times : before surgical resection and on postoperative days 7 and 30 . The median of Ang2 and VEGF concentrations increased on postoperative day 7 and decreased on day 30 . On the other hand , the concentration of sTie2 decreased on the 7th day after resection and did not change statistically later on . The concentrations of Ang1 and sVEGF R1 did not change after the surgery . Lung cancer resection results in proangiogenic plasma protein changes that may stimulate tumor recurrences and metastases after early resection .
Contact-inhibition ubiquitously exists in non-transformed cells and explains the poor regenerative capacity of in vivo human retinal pigment epithelial cells ( RPE ) during aging , injury and diseases . RPE injury or degeneration may unlock mitotic block mediated by contact inhibition but may also promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) contributing to retinal blindness . Herein , we confirmed that EMT ensued in post-confluent ARPE-19 cells when contact inhibition was disrupted with EGTA followed by addition of EGF and FGF-2 because of activation of canonical Wnt and Smad/ZEB signaling . In contrast , knockdown of p120-catenin ( p120 ) unlocked such mitotic block by activating p120/Kaiso , but not activating canonical Wnt and Smad/ZEB signaling , thus avoiding EMT . Nuclear BrdU labeling was correlated with nuclear release of Kaiso through p120 nuclear translocation , which was associated with activation of RhoA-ROCK signaling , destabilization of microtubules . Prolonged p120 siRNA knockdown followed by withdrawal further expanded RPE into more compact monolayers with a normal phenotype and a higher density . This new strategy based on selective activation of p120/Kaiso but not Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling obviates the need of using single cells and the risk of EMT , and may be deployed to engineer surgical grafts containing RPE and other tissues .
Targeting receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) degradation may be an interesting approach to reduce RTK cell signaling in cancer cells . Here we show that increasing E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B-lineage lymphoma ( c-Cbl ) expression using lentiviral infection decreased osteosarcoma cell replication and survival and reduced cell migration and invasion in murine and human osteosarcoma cells . Conversely , c-Cbl inhibition using short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) increased osteosarcoma cell growth and survival , as well as invasion and migration , indicating that c-Cbl plays a critical role as a bone tumor suppressor . Importantly , the anticancer effect of increasing c-Cbl expression in osteosarcoma cells was related mainly to the downregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRalpha ) . In a murine bone tumor model , increasing c-Cbl expression also reduced RTK expression , resulting in decreased tumor cell proliferation and survival and reduced tumor growth . Interestingly , increasing c-Cbl also markedly reduced lung metastasis in mice . Tissue microarray analysis revealed that low c-Cbl protein expression is associated with elevated EGFR and PDGFRalpha protein levels in human osteosarcoma with poor outcome . This study shows that increasing c-Cbl expression reduces osteosarcoma cell growth , survival , and metastasis in part through downregulation of RTKs , which supports the potential therapeutic interest of targeting c-Cbl in malignant bone diseases involving increased RTK .
BACKGROUND The c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase is aberrantly activated in many solid tumors . In a prior study we showed that prostate cancer PC-3 cells exhibit constitutively activated c-Met without exogenous hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) ; however whether this characteristic is due to an endogenous HGF/c-Met autocrine loop remains controversial . In the current study we examined the response of PC-3 cells to an anti-HGF neutralizing antibody or a small molecule Met kinase inhibitor ( BMS-777607 ) . METHODS Cell scattering was tested by monitoring cell morphology after HGF stimulation . Cell migration was examined by both " wound-healing " and transwell assasy and invasion was detected by Matrigel-coated transwell assay . Proliferation , survival and anoikis were determined by MTT , colony formation and trypan blue exclusion assay , respectively . Gene and protein expression were assessed by real-time PCR and Western blot , respectively . RESULTS Although HGF mRNA could be detected in PC-3 cells , the molecular weight of secreted " HGF " protein was inconsistent with the functional recombinant HGF . Furthermore , conditioned medium from PC-3 cell cultures was ineffective at triggering either motogenic behavior or c-Met signaling in DU145 , another prostate cancer cell line expressing c-Met but lacking basal c-Met activation . PC-3 cells also were not responsive to the anti-HGF neutralizing antibody in experiments assessing proliferation , migration , or c-Met signaling . BMS-777607 treatment with micromolar doses nonetheless led to significant inhibition of multiple PC-3 cell functions including proliferation , clonogenicity , migration and invasion . At the molecular level , BMS-777607 suppressed autophosphorylated c-Met and downstream c-Src and Akt pathways . CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the constitutive c-Met activation in PC-3 is independent of autocrine stimulation . Because PC-3 cells were responsive to BMS-777607 but not the anti-HGF antibody , the findings also indicate that under circumstances where c-Met is constitutively hyperactive in the absence of functional HGF , targeting the c-Met receptor remains a viable therapeutic option to impede cancer progression .
We previously reported that hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) activated by angiotensin II ( AngII ) facilitate stromal fibrosis and tumor progression in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC ) . AngII has been known as a growth factor which can promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) in renal epithelial cells , alveolar epithelial cells and peritoneal mesothelial cells . However , in the past , the relationship between AngII and stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( SDF-1 ) in the microenvironment around cancer and the role of AngII on EMT of cancer cells has not been reported in detail . SDF-1 and its specific receptor , CXCR4 , are now receiving attention as a mechanism of cell progression and metastasis . In this study , we examined whether activated HSCs promote tumor fibrogenesis , tumor progression and distant metastasis by mediating EMT via the AngII/AngII type 1 receptor ( AT-1 ) and the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis . Two human ICC cell lines and a human HSC line , LI-90 , express CXCR4 . Significantly higher concentration of SDF-1alpha was released into the supernatant of LI-90 cells to which AngII had been added . SDF-1alpha increased the proliferative activity of HSCs and enhanced the activation of HSCs as a growth factor . Furthermore , addition of SDF-1alpha and AngII enhanced the increase of the migratory capability and vimentin expression , reduced E-cadherin expression , and translocated the expression of beta-catenin into the nucleus and cytoplasm in ICC cells . Co-culture with HSCs also enhanced the migratory capability of ICC cells . These findings suggest that SDF-1alpha , released from activated HSCs and AngII , play important roles in cancer progression , tumor fibrogenesis , and migration in autocrine and paracrine fashion by mediating EMT . Our mechanistic findings may provide pivotal insights into the molecular mechanism of the AngII and SDF-1alpha-initiated signaling pathway that regulates fibrogenesis in cancerous stroma , tumor progression and meta-stasis of tumor cells expressing AT-1 and CXCR4 .
Past studies have shown that amplified insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF1)/IGF1 receptor ( IGF1-R ) signalling has an important role in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) development , progression and resistance to treatment . In this report , we demonstrate that downregulation of microRNA-497 ( miR-497 ) as a result of DNA copy number reduction is involved in upregulation of IGF1-R in CRC cells . MiR-497 and miR-195 of the miR-15/16/195/424/497 family that share the same 3 ' untranslated region ( 3'UTR ) binding seed sequence and are predicted to target IGF1-R were concurrently downregulated in the majority of CRC tissues relative to paired adjacent normal mucosa . However , only overexpression of miR-497 led to suppression of the IGF1-R 3'UTR activity and downregulation of the endogenous IGF1-R protein in CRC cells . This was associated with inhibition of cell survival , proliferation and invasion , and increased sensitivity to apoptosis induced by various stimuli including the chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil , and the death ligand tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand . The biological effect of miR-497 on CRC cells was largely mediated by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signalling , as overexpression of an active form of Akt reversed its impact on cell survival and proliferation , recapitulating the effect of overexpression of IGF1-R . Downregulation of miR-497 and miR-195 appeared to associate with copy number loss of a segment of chromosome 17p13.1 , where these miRs are located at proximity . Similarly to miR-195 , the members of the same miR family , miR-424 that was upregulated , and miR-15a , miR-15b and miR-16 that were unaltered in expression in CRC tissues compared with paired adjacent normal mucosa , did not appear to have a role in regulating the expression of IGF1-R . Taken together , these results identify downregulation of miR-497 as an important mechanism of upregulation of IGF1-R in CRC cells that contributes to malignancy of CRC.Oncogene advance online publication , 18 June 2012 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.214 .
Contact inhibition of locomotion ( CIL ) is the process by which cells stop the continual migration in the same direction after collision with another cell . Highly invasive malignant cells exhibit diminished CIL when they contact stromal cells , which allows invasion of the tissue by tumors . We show that Nm23-H1 is essential for the suppression of Rac1 through inactivation of Tiam1 at the sites of cell-cell contact , which plays a pivotal role in CIL . U87MG cells show CIL when they contact normal glia . In spheroid confrontation assays U87MG cells showed only limited invasion of the glial population , but reduction of Nm23-H1 expression in U87MG cells abrogated CIL resulting in invasion . In U87MG cells , Nm23-H1 is translocated to the sites of contact with glia through association with \u03b1-catenin and N-cadherin . Mutants of Nm23-H1 , which lacked the binding ability with Tiam1 , or \u03b1-catenin did not restore CIL . Moreover , the expression of ephrin-B1 in tumor cells disrupted CIL and promoted invasion . As one mechanism , ephrin-B1 inhibits the association of Nm23-H1 with Tiam1 , which contributes for activation of Rac1 . These results indicate a novel function of Nm23-H1 to control CIL , and its negative regulation by ephrin-B1 .
BACKGROUND Metastatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the kidney is a rare malignant vascular tumor with a wide spectrum of behaviors . CASE REPORT We present the case of a 53-year-old male patient with tumor metastases which developed after radical nephrectomy . We describe the immunohistochemistry profile of the tumor and the successful long-term results of treatment with sunitinib , a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Also , we discuss the rationale for using this type of medication based on immunohistochemistry results . CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge , this is the first reported case of metastatic renal epithelioid hemangioendothelioma treated successfully with sunitinib .
Elevated phosphorylation of estrogen receptor alpha ( ERalpha ) at serines 118 ( S118 ) and 167 ( S167 ) is associated with favorable outcome for tamoxifen adjuvant therapy and may serve as surrogate markers for a functional ERalpha signaling pathway in breast cancer . It is possible that loss of phosphorylation at S118 and/or S167 could disrupt ERalpha signaling , resulting in aggressive ERalpha-independent breast cancer cells . To this end , MCF-7 breast cancer cells were stably transfected with an ERalpha-specific short hairpin RNA that reduced endogenous ERalpha . The resulting cell line was stably transfected with wild-type ERalpha ( ER-AB cells ) , or ERalpha containing serine to alanine mutation at S118 or S167 ( S118A cells and S167A cells , respectively ) . These stable cell lines expressed approximately equivalent ERalpha compared with parental MCF-7 cells and were evaluated for growth , morphology , migration/invasion , and ERalpha-regulated gene expression . S118A cells and S167A cells exhibited increased growth and migration/invasion in vitro . Forward- and side-scatter flow cytometry revealed that S167A cells were smaller in size , and both S118A and S167A cells exhibited less cellular complexity . S118A and S167A cells expressed pancytokeratin and membrane localization of beta-catenin and did not express vimentin , indicating retention of epithelial lineage markers . Expression of ERalpha-target genes and other genes regulated by ERalpha signaling or involved in breast cancer were markedly altered in both S118A and S167A cells . In summary , attenuated phosphorylation of ERalpha at S118 and S167 significantly affected cellular physiology and behavior in MCF-7 breast cancer cells , resulting in increased growth , migration/invasion , compromised expression of ERalpha target genes , and markedly altered gene expression patterns .
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are small noncoding RNAs , 19-24 nucleotides in length , that regulate gene expression and are expressed aberrantly in most types of cancer . MiRNAs also have been detected in the blood of cancer patients and can serve as circulating biomarkers . It has been shown that secreted miRNAs within exosomes can be transferred from cell to cell and can regulate gene expression in the receiving cells by canonical binding to their target messenger RNAs . Here we show that tumor-secreted miR-21 and miR-29a also can function by another mechanism , by binding as ligands to receptors of the Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) family , murine TLR7 and human TLR8 , in immune cells , triggering a TLR-mediated prometastatic inflammatory response that ultimately may lead to tumor growth and metastasis . Thus , by acting as paracrine agonists of TLRs , secreted miRNAs are key regulators of the tumor microenvironment . This mechanism of action of miRNAs is implicated in tumor-immune system communication and is important in tumor growth and spread , thus representing a possible target for cancer treatment .
OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to immunohistochemically evaluate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-1 , MMP- 2 , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase ( TIMP)-1 , TIMP-2 , and podoplanin in oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) . Immunohistochemical staining of podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessel density ( LVD ) was also assessed . STUDY DESIGN Forty cases of OSCC were analyzed by immunohistochemistry . RESULTS MMP-2 , MMP-10 , TIMP-1 , TIMP-2 , and podoplanin were detected in each of the 40 OSCC cases . The expression of MMP-2 was significantly correlated with histologic grade . The expression of podoplanin was positively correlated with gender and negatively correlated with tumor size . A significant positive correlation was also detected between LVD and the presence of lymph node metastases , gender , age , and diameter of the lymph node ( if involved ) , as well as histologic grade . CONCLUSIONS The results are suggestive of important roles that MMP-2 , MMP-10 , TIMP-2 , and podoplanin play in pathologic processes of OSCC , including invasion . Our findings also suggest that LVD may play a role in lymphatic metastasis and tumor progression .
Src kinase is elevated in breast tumors that are ER/PR negative and do not overexpress HER2 , but clinical trials with Src inhibitors have shown little activity . The present study evaluated preclinical efficacy of a novel peptidomimetic compound , KX-01 ( KX2-391 ) , that exhibits dual action as an Src and pretubulin inhibitor . KX-01 was evaluated as a single-agent and in combination with paclitaxel in MDA-MB-231 , MDA-MB-157 , and MDA-MB-468 human ER/PR/HER2-negative breast cancer cells . Treatments were evaluated by growth/apoptosis , isobologram analysis , migration/invasion assays , tumor xenograft volume , metastasis , and measurement of Src , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , microtubules , Ki67 , and microvessel density . KX-01 inhibited cell growth in vitro and in combination with paclitaxel resulted in synergistic growth inhibition . KX-01 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 tumor xenografts ( 1 and 5 mg/kg , twice daily ) . KX-01 inhibited activity of Src and downstream mediator FAK in tumors that was coincident with reduced proliferation and angiogenesis and increased apoptosis . KX01 also resulted in microtubule disruption in tumors . Combination of KX-01 with paclitaxel resulted in significant regression of MDA-MB-231 tumors and reduced metastasis to mouse lung and liver . KX-01 is a potently active Src/pretubulin inhibitor that inhibits breast tumor growth and metastasis . As ER/PR/HER2-negative patients are candidates for paclitaxel therapy , combination with KX-01 may potentiate antitumor efficacy in management of this aggressive breast cancer subtype .
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the Expression and correlation of cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGF ) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma . METHOD In this study , expression levels of COX-2 , VEGF were examined in 58 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 38 patients with inflammation in nasopharyngeal mucosa by immunohistochemistry method . RESULT The expression of COX-2 , VEGF were higher in nasopharyngeal carcinoma than those in nasopharyngeal mucosa ( P < 0.05 ) , and they had some correlation with the invasion and lymphatic metastasis and with the clinical stage of nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( P < 0.05 ) . The expression of COX-2 was positively correlated with that of VEGF ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION The coexpression of COX-2 and VEGF may play animportant role in the carcinogenesis and development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma , and they may prom ( see text ) lymph node metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma .
BACKGROUND It has been proven that metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 ( MACC1 ) is a new gene that is related to the invasion and metastasis of tumors . MACC1 also regulates c-met expression . The aim of this study is to explore the expressions of MACC1 and hepatocyte growth factor receptor ( c-met ) , and its relationship with invasion , metastasis , and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . METHODS MACC1 and c-met expressions were detected in 103 cases of NSCLC and 40 cases of neighboring normal lung cancer tissue using immunohistochemistry . RESULTS MACC1 and c-met expressions were significantly higher in lung cancer tissues than that in neighboring normal tissue ( P<0.001 ) . MACC1 and c-met expressions were associated with poor differentiation , advanced T stages , lymph node metastasis , and advanced TNM stages ( P<0.05 ) of NSCLC , but not with sex , age , smoking , and histological classification ( P>0.05 ) . In addition , a positive correlation between MACC1 and c-met expressions was observed ( r=0.403 , P<0.001 ) . The result from the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the five-year survival rate in patients with positive MACC1 and c-met expressions was remarkanly lower than that in patients with negative expressions ( P<0.05 ) . The result from the Cox regression analysis showed that MACC1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC ( P=0.026 ) . CONCLUSIONS MACC1 and c-met have an important function in the differentiation , invasion , and metastasis of NSCLC . MACC1 and c-met have poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC . Moreover , MACC1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC .
Semaphorin 5A , a member of semaphorin family , was originally identified as axonal guidance factor functioning during neuronal development . Previously , we showed that the expression of semaphorin 5A might contribute to the metastasis of gastric cancer . However , its functional roles and mechanism(s) in invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer remain unclear . By using human gastric caner cell lines Parental SGC7901 , SGC7901-siScrambled and SGC7901-siSema 5A , we found that semaphorin 5A significantly promoted the invasive and metastatic abilities of gastric cancer cell in vitro . Semaphorin 5A increased the expression of MMP9 by activating phosphorylated ErK1/2 in gastric cancer cell . Furthermore , MEK inhibitor PD98059 and MMP9 antibody ( Ab ) significantly inhibited in vitro invasive and metastatic abilities induced by semaphorin 5A . Taken together , the present work revealed a novel function of semaphorin 5A that the existence of semaphorin 5A could promote invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer by regulating MMP9 expression , at least partially , via the MEK/ERKs signal transduction pathway . Semaphorin 5A and its regulated molecules could be the potential targets for cancer therapy .
Gadd45a , the first well-defined p53 downstream gene , can be induced by multiple DNA-damaging agents , which plays important roles in the control of cell cycle checkpoint , DNA repair process and signaling transduction . Our previous findings suggested that Gadd45a maintains cell-cell adhesion and cell contact inhibition . However , little is known about how Gadd45a participates in the suppression of malignancy in human cancer cells . To examine the functions of Gadd45a in cell invasion and metastasis , we performed the adhesion , wound-healing and transwell assays in Gadd45a ( +/+ ) and Gadd45a ( -/- ) MEF cell lines . We found the adhesion , migration and invasive abilities were much higher in Gadd45a deficient cells . We furthermore applied high-throughput cDNA microarray analysis and bioinformatics analysis to analyze the mechanisms of Gadd45a gene in invasion and metastasis . Compared with the Gadd45a wild type cells , the Gadd45a deficient cells showed a wide range of transcripts alterations . The altered gene pathways were predicted by the MAS software , which indicated focal adhesion,cell communication,ECM-receptor interaction as the three main pathways . Real-time PCR was employed to validate the differentially expressed genes . Interestingly , we figured out that the deregulations of these genes are caused neither by genomic aberrations nor methylation status . These findings provided a novel insight that Gadd45a may involve in tumor progression by regulating related genes expressions .
Although interleukin-28A ( IL-28A ) is believed to have an antiviral effect , its role in tumor migration requires further examination . The present study was intended to verify the effect of IL-28A on the migration of UMUC-3 bladder cancer cells . IL-28A and its receptor IL-28AR1 mRNA were detected in UMUC-3 cells . Although exogenous IL-28A showed no effect on cell proliferation , a wound-healing migration assay showed that the migration of UMUC-3 cells was induced by IL-28A . Furthermore , treatment of the cells with IL-28A significantly promoted MMP-9 expression via binding activities of NF-kappaB and AP-1 . IL-28A also induced the activation of p38MAPK and Jak2-Stat2 signaling . Using the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and the dominant-negative plasmid DN-p38 , we found evidence that the inhibition of p38MAPK signaling suppressed the effects of IL-28A including wound-healing migration and MMP-9 expression by activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 binding in UMUC-3 cells . However , Jak-2 inhibition by AG490 did not affect IL-28A-induced migration of UMUC-3 cells . Collectively , we suggest for the first time that the p38MAPK pathway mediates IL-28A-induced cell migration through MMP-9 expression by activating NF-kappaB and AP-1 binding motifs .
BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer is one of the main cancers in the Western world . About 90% of the deaths arise from formation of distant metastasis . The expression of the newly identified gene metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 ( MACC1 ) is a prognostic indicator for colon cancer metastasis . Here , we analyzed for the first time the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the coding region of MACC1 for clinical outcome of colorectal cancer patients . Additionally , we screened met proto-oncogene ( Met ) , the transcriptional target gene of MACC1 , for mutations . METHODS We sequenced the coding exons of MACC1 in 154 colorectal tumors ( stages I , II and III ) and the crucial exons of Met in 60 colorectal tumors ( stages I , II and III ) . We analyzed the association of MACC1 polymorphisms with clinical data , including metachronous metastasis , UICC stages , tumor invasion , lymph node metastasis and patients ' survival ( n = 154 , stages I , II and III ) . Furthermore , we performed biological assays in order to evaluate the functional impact of MACC1 SNPs on the motility of colorectal cancer cells . RESULTS We genotyped three MACC1 SNPs in the coding region . Thirteen % of the tumors had the genotype cg ( rs4721888 , L31V ) , 48% a ct genotype ( rs975263 , S515L ) and 84% a gc or cc genotype ( rs3735615 , R804T ) . We found no association of these SNPs with clinicopathological parameters or with patients ' survival , when analyzing the entire patients ' cohort . An increased risk for a shorter metastasis-free survival of patients with a ct genotype ( rs975263 ) was observed in younger colon cancer patients with stage I or II ( P = 0.041 , n = 18 ) . In cell culture , MACC1 SNPs did not affect MACC1-induced cell motility and proliferation . CONCLUSION In summary , the identification of coding MACC1 SNPs in primary colorectal tumors does not improve the prediction for metastasis formation or for patients ' survival compared to MACC1 expression analysis alone . The ct genotype ( rs975263 ) might be associated with a reduced survival for younger colon cancer patients in early stages . However , further studies with larger sample sizes are needed .
Interleukin-23 ( IL-23 ) plays an essential role in the mucosal immune system . It has been suggested that IL-23 is able to induce carcinogenesis as well as inflammation and a recent study revealed that IL-23R is expressed in colorectal carcinoma cells . However , neither the differences in the IL-23R expression among the patients nor the concrete functions of IL-23 in colorectal carcinoma cells have been revealed . The aim of the present study was to examine the characteristics of IL-23R expression in colorectal carcinoma and the direct effects of IL-23 on colorectal cancer cells . We examined the IL-23R expression in human colorectal cancer tissue samples by immunohistochemistry . Cell proliferation and invasion assays under IL-23 stimulation were performed using cultured cells derived from colorectal cancer . ELISA and real-time PCR were used to evaluate the transforming growth factor ( TGF)-beta production due to IL-23 stimulation . All of the TNM stage IV patients were positive for IL-23R . IL-23R expression in the carcinoma tissue was also relatively high at the deepest point of invasion in certain cases . The proliferative and invasive activities and/or TGF-beta production of DLD-1 cells increased by IL-23 stimulation , whereas no change was observed in the activities of MIP101 and KM12c cells . IL-23 directly enhanced the malignancy of the colon carcinoma cells . An autocrine mechanism via TGF-beta production may underlie these effects . IL-23 is therefore a potential target for cancer immunotherapy . However , the homogeneity in IL-23R expression and the effects of IL-23 on colorectal carcinoma cells should be considered .
Proton radiotherapy has gained more favor among oncologists as a treatment option for localized and deep-seated tumors . In addition , protons are a major constituent of the space radiation astronauts receive during space flights . The potential for these exposures to lead to , or enhance cancer risk has not been well studied . Our objective is to study the biological effects of low energy protons on epithelial cells and its propensity to enhance transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGFbeta1)-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , a process occurring during tumor progression and critical for invasion and metastasis . Non-transformed mink lung epithelial cells ( Mv1Lu ) and hTERT- immortalized human esophageal epithelial cells ( EPC ) were used in this study . EMT was identified by alterations in cell morphology , EMT-related gene expression changes determined using real-time PCR , and EMT changes in specific cellular markers detected by immunostaining and western blotting . Although TGFbeta1 treatment alone is able to induce EMT in both Mv1Lu and EPC cells , low energy protons ( 5 MeV ) at doses as low as 0.1 Gy can enhance TGFbeta1 induced EMT . Protons alone can also induce a mild induction of EMT . SD208 , a potent TGFbeta Receptor 1 ( TGFbetaR1 ) kinase inhibitor , can efficiently block TGFbeta1/Smad signaling and attenuate EMT induction . We suggest a model for EMT after proton irradiation in normal and cancerous tissue based on our results that showed that low and high doses of protons can sensitize normal human epithelial cells to mesenchymal transition , more prominently in the presence of TGFbeta1 , but also in the absence of TGFbeta1 .
The tumor suppressor gene p53 has been implicated in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and tumor metastasis by regulating microRNA ( miRNA ) expression . Here , we report that mutant p53 exerts oncogenic functions and promotes EMT in endometrial cancer ( EC ) by directly binding to the promoter of miR-130b ( a negative regulator of ZEB1 ) and inhibiting its transcription . We transduced p53 mutants into p53-null EC cells , profiled the miRNA expression by miRNA microarray and identified miR-130b as a potential target of mutant p53 . Ectopic expression of p53 mutants repressed the expression of miR-130b and triggered ZEB1-dependent EMT and cancer cell invasion . Loss of an endogenous p53 mutation increased the expression of miR-130b , which resulted in reduced ZEB1 expression and attenuation of the EMT phenotype . Furthermore , re-expression of miR-130b suppressed mutant p53-induced EMT and ZEB1 expression . Importantly , the expression of miR-130 was significantly reduced in EC tissues , and patients with higher expression levels of miR-130b survived longer . These data provide a novel understanding of the roles of p53 gain-of-function mutations in accelerating tumor progression and metastasis through modulation of the miR-130b-ZEB1 axis .
22Rv1 is a common prostate cancer cell line used in xenograft mouse experiments as well as in vitro cell culture assays to study aspects of prostate cancer tumorigenesis . Recently , this cell line was shown to harbor multiple copies of a gammaretrovirus , called XMRV , integrated in its genome . While the original prostate cancer xenograft CWR22 is free of any retrovirus , subsequently generated cell lines 22Rv1 and CWR-R1 , carry this virus and additionally shed infectious gammaretroviral particles in their supernatant . Although XMRV most likely was generated by recombination events in cell culture this virus has been demonstrated to infect human cells in vitro and 22Rv1 as well as CWR-R1 cells are now considered biosafety 2 reagents . Here , we demonstrate that 22Rv1 cells with reduced retroviral transcription show reduced tumor angiogenesis and increased necrosis of the primary tumor derived from xenografted cells in scid mice when compared to the parental cell line . The presence of XMRV transcripts significantly increases secretion of osteopontin ( OPN ) , CXCL14 , IL13 and TIMP2 in 22Rv1 cells . Furthermore , these data are supported by in vitro cell invasion and differentiation assays . Collectively , our data suggest that the presence of XMRV transcripts at least partially contributes to 22Rv1 characteristics observed in vitro and in vivo with regard to migration , invasion and tumor angiogenesis . We propose that data received with 22Rv1 cells or equivalent cells carrying xenotropic gammaretroviruses should be carefully controlled including other prostate cancer cell lines tested for viral sequences .
Metastatic cancer is extremely difficult to treat , and the presence of metastases greatly reduces a cancer patient's likelihood of long-term survival . The ZEB1 transcriptional repressor promotes metastasis through downregulation of microRNAs ( miRs ) that are strong inducers of epithelial differentiation and inhibitors of stem cell factors . Given that each miR can target multiple genes with diverse functions , we posited that the prometastatic network controlled by ZEB1 extends beyond these processes . We tested this hypothesis using a mouse model of human lung adenocarcinoma metastasis driven by ZEB1 , human lung carcinoma cells , and human breast carcinoma cells . Transcriptional profiling studies revealed that ZEB1 controls the expression of numerous oncogenic and tumor-suppressive miRs , including miR-34a . Ectopic expression of miR-34a decreased tumor cell invasion and metastasis , inhibited the formation of promigratory cytoskeletal structures , suppressed activation of the RHO GTPase family , and regulated a gene expression signature enriched in cytoskeletal functions and predictive of outcome in human lung adenocarcinomas . We identified several miR-34a target genes , including Arhgap1 , which encodes a RHO GTPase activating protein that was required for tumor cell invasion . These findings demonstrate that ZEB1 drives prometastatic actin cytoskeletal remodeling by downregulating miR-34a expression and provide a compelling rationale to develop miR-34a as a therapeutic agent in lung cancer patients .
Focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) is an important mediator of extracellular matrix integrin signaling , cell motility , cell proliferation and cell survival . Increased FAK expression is observed in a variety of solid human tumors and increased FAK expression and activity frequently correlate with metastatic disease and poor prognosis . Herein we identify miR-7 as a direct regulator of FAK expression. miR-7 expression is decreased in malignant versus normal breast tissue and its expression correlates inversely with metastasis in human breast cancer patients . Forced expression of miR-7 produced increased E-CADHERIN and decreased FIBRONECTIN and VIMENTIN expression in breast cancer cells . The levels of miR-7 expression was positively correlated with E-CADHERIN mRNA and negatively correlated with VIMENTIN mRNA levels in breast cancer samples . Forced expression of miR-7 in aggressive breast cancer cell lines suppressed tumor cell monolayer proliferation , anchorage independent growth , three-dimensional growth in Matrigel , migration and invasion . Conversely , inhibition of miR-7 in the HBL-100 mammary epithelial cell line promoted cell proliferation and anchorage independent growth . Rescue of FAK expression reversed miR-7 suppression of migration and invasion. miR-7 also inhibited primary breast tumor development , local invasion and metastatic colonization of breast cancer xenografts . Thus , miR-7 expression is decreased in metastatic breast cancer , correlates with the level of epithelial differentiation of the tumor and inhibits metastatic progression .
OBJECTIVES Lymph node metastasis is among the most important prognostic factors for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after curative esophagectomy ; however , the extent of lymphadenectomy is still controversial . The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency of lymphatic metastases and to study the pattern of lymph node metastasis in a large study population . METHODS The data from 1361 patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent curative R0 esophagectomy were retrospectively examined . Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with lymph node metastasis . RESULTS Of the 1361 patients , 714 ( 52.5% ) were found to have lymph node metastasis . The frequency of lymph node metastasis increased as the tumor invasion increased . Paratracheal nodes were the most frequent metastasis nodes ( 15.9% ) . The frequency of lymph node metastasis was 9.8% in the neck , 18.0% in the upper mediastinum , 18.9% in the middle mediastinum , 11.8% in the lower mediastinum , and 28.4% in the abdomen . Of these 714 patients , 424 ( 31.2% ) presented with 1 field involvement , 255 ( 18.7% ) with 2 fields , and 35 ( 2.6% ) with 3 fields involvement . Logistic regression analysis revealed tumor length ( P<.001 ) , tumor invasion ( P<.001 ) , tumor differentiation ( P=.003 ) , and lymphovascular invasion ( P<.001 ) were risk factors for lymph node metastasis . Tumor location ( P<.001 ) , tumor invasion ( P=.003 ) , lymphovascular invasion ( P=.004 ) , and paratracheal lymph node involvement ( P=.002 ) were identified as risk factors for cervical lymph node metastasis . CONCLUSIONS Metastases were more frequent in the abdomen than in the neck . Total mediastinal and upper abdominal lymphadenectomy should be carefully conducted . Certain factors , such as tumor location , depth of tumor invasion , lymphovascular invasion , and paratracheal lymph node involvement , might be helpful in determining the need to perform cervical lymphadenectomy in individual patients .
BACKGROUND Cholangiocarcinoma , a type of malignant tumor , originates from epithelial cells of the bile duct . Perineural invasion is common path for cholangiocarcinoma metastasis , and it is highly correlated with postoperative recurrence and poor prognosis . It has been reported that muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 ( mAChR M3 ) is widely expressed in digestive tract cancer , and may play an important role in the proliferation , differentiation , transformation and carcinogenesis of tumors . This study was to explore the effect of mAChR M3 on the growth of cholangiocarcinoma cells in vitro and provide a new approach to the pathogenesis and treatment of cholangiocarcinoma . METHODS Streptavidin-biotin complex immunohistochemistry was carried out to assess the expression of mAChR M3 in surgical specimens of cholangiocarcinomas ( 40 cases ) and normal bile duct tissues ( 9 ) , as well as to investigate nerve infiltration . The cholangiocarcinoma cells were treated with different concentrations of selective M-receptor agonist pilocarpine and M-receptor blocker atropine sulfate to induce changes in cell proliferation . The experimental data were analyzed by the Chi-square test . RESULTS The strongly-positive expression rate of mAChR M3 was much higher in poorly-differentiated ( 69% , 9/13 ) than in well- and moderately-differentiated cholangiocarcinomas ( 30% , 8/27 ) ( X2=5.631 , P<0.05 ) . The strongly-positive mAChR M3 expression rate in hilar cholangiocarcinoma ( 50% , 14/28 ) was higher than that in cholangiocarcinomas from the middle and lower common bile duct ( 25% , 3/12 ) ( X2=2.148 , P<0.05 ) . Cholangiocarcinomas with distant metastasis had a strongly-positive expression rate ( 75% , 9/12 ) , which was much higher than those without distant metastasis ( 29% , 8/28 ) ( X2=7.410 , P<0.01 ) . The absorbance value in the pilocarpine+atropine group was significantly higher than the corresponding value in the pilocarpine group . CONCLUSIONS The expression of mAChR M3 is influenced by the extent of differentiation , distant metastasis and the site of cholangiocarcinoma . It also plays a key role in the proliferation and metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma .
Altered p53 protein is prevalently associated with the pathologic class of triple-negative breast cancers and loss of p53 function has recently been linked to the induction of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and acquisition of stemness properties . We explored the association between TP53 mutational status and expression of some genes involved in the canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway ( the most potent EMT inducer ) and in two early EMT associated events : loss of cell polarity and acquisition of stemness-associated features . We used a publicly accessible microarray dataset consisting of 251 p53-sequenced primary breast cancers . Statistical analysis indicated that mutant p53 tumors ( especially those harboring a severe mutation ) were consistent with the aggressive class of triple-negative cancers and that , differently from cell cultures , surgical tumors underexpressed some TGF-\u03b2 related transcription factors known as involved in EMT ( ID1 , ID4 , SMAD3 , SMAD4 , SMAD5 , ZEB1 ) . These unexpected findings suggest an interesting relationship between p53 mutation , mammary cell dedifferentiation , and the concomitant acquisition of stemlike properties ( as indicated by the overexpression of PROM1 and NOTCH1 genes ) , which improve tumor cells aggressiveness as indicated by the overexpression of genes associated with cell proliferation ( CDK4 , CDK6 , MKI67 ) and migration ( CXCR4 , MMP1 ) .
Breast cancer metastasis is the most common cause of cancer-related death in women . Thus , seeking targets of breast tumor cells is an attractive goal towards improving clinical treatment . The present study showed that CCL18 from tumor-associated macrophages could promote breast cancer metastasis via PITPNM3 . In addition , we found that pachymic acid ( PA ) could dose-dependently inhibit migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells , with or without rCCL18 stimulation . Furthermore , evidence was obtained that PA could suppress the phosphorylation of PITPNM3 and the combination of CCL18 and PITPNM3 . Therefore , we speculate that PA could inhibit breast cancer metastasis via PITPNM3 .
BACKGROUND Although basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) is the most common type of skin cancer , the incidence of metastasis is exceedingly low . OBJECTIVE Case presentation of a basal cell carcinoma arising on the dorsum of the foot with inguinal and pelvic lymph node metastases . METHOD Case presentation with literature review . RESULT On the basis of our review of Japanese literature , the risk factors for BCC metastasis are occurrence on the genitalia , diameter of more than 3 cm , deep invasion of tumor cells into extradermal structures , and infiltrative/morpheic histological type . CONCLUSION Although metastasis from BCC is extremely rare , the prognosis of metastatic BCC is often poor . Careful follow-up is recommended in cases with high risk factors .
Curcumin ( diferuloylmethane ) is a polyphenol derived from the plant turmeric ( Curcuma longa ) , which is commonly used as a spice . Although anti-carcinogenic , anti-oxidant , anti-inflammation , and anti-angiogenic properties have been reported , the effect of curcumin on breast cancer metastasis is unknown . Matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) is a major component in cancer cell invasion . In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effect of curcumin on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion and the molecular mechanisms involved in MCF-7 cells . Our results showed that curcumin inhibits TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion through suppressing NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation . Also , curcumin strongly repressed the TPA-induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK and inhibited TPA-induced translocation of PKCalpha from the cytosol to the membrane , but did not affect the translocation of PKCdelta . These results indicate that curcumin-mediated inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion involves the suppression of the PKCalpha , MAPK and NF-kappaB/AP-1 pathway in MCF-7 cells . Curcumin may have potential value in restricting breast cancer metastasis .
BACKGROUND The presence of distant metastases from colorectal cancer ( CRC ) does not preclude curative treatment . Early detection of pulmonary metastases at a potentially curable stage could improve survival . The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic significance of commonly reported clinicopathologic features to identify high-risk patients who would likely benefit from more intensive chest surveillance for pulmonary metastases . MATERIAL AND METHOD A total of 351 consecutive patients , with surgical stages I-III colorectal cancer , who underwent curative resection at Phramongkutklao hospital from 1999 to 2005 , were followed regularly according to the established guidelines with routine physical examination , serum carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) and colonoscopic surveillance . Imaging studies for detecting metastases were computed tomography ( CT ) , plain film radiography , and ultrasonograpy . Clinical and pathologic features were analyzed for their association with pulmonary metastasis . RESULTS There were 145 patients who had been operated for longer than five years after curative intent surgery . Of these , nineteen patients were lost to follow-up or died from other causes that were unrelated to colorectal cancer . Pulmonary metastases were detected in 26 patients by either CXR or CT scan . Median time to pulmonary metastasis was 19 months ( 95 percent CI , 12-35 ) . According to an univariate analysis , with log-rank test , identified four factors associated with pulmonary metastasis : Tumor stage T4 , Nodal stage N2 , elevation of serum CEA > 3.4 ng/ml and presence of lymphovascular invasion(LVI) . According to a multivariate analysis , with Cox regression , found an elevation of serum CEA > 3.4 ng/ml which was an independent factor that was significantly associated with pulmonary metastasis ( Hazard ratio ( HR ) , 8.9 ; 95 percent CI , 3.6-22 ; p < 0.01 ) . The present study revealed that 50 percent of patients who had more than one of these risk factors would eventually develop pulmonary metastases . CONCLUSION An elevation of serum CEA > or = 3.4 ng/ml was found as an independent factor that was significantly associated with pulmonary metastasis whereas tumor stage T4 , nodal stage N2 and presence of lymphovascular invasion ( LVI ) were not independent clinicopathologic features associated with subsequent pulmonary metastases . Chest CT scan has greater sensitivity than chest radiography in detection of pulmonary metastasis and should be considered as an imaging study of choice for intensive chest surveillance for patients who had more than one of these risk factors .
Angiogenesis is defined as the formation of new blood vessels form existing vessels surrounding a tumor . The process of angiogenesis is an important step for tumor growth and metastasis , as is inflammation . Thus , angiogenesis inhibitors that suppress inflammation have been studied as an anticancer treatment . Recently , many research groups have investigated the anti-angiogenic activity of natural compounds since some have been demonstrated to have anticancer properties . Among many natural compounds , we focused on betaine , which is known to suppress inflammation . Betaine , trimethylglycine ( TMG ) , was first discovered in the juice of sugar beets and was later shown to be present in wheat , shellfish and spinach . In Southeast Asia , betaine is used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of hepatic disorders . Here , we report the anti-angiogenic action of betaine . Betaine inhibited invitro angiogenic cascade , tube formation , migration and invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . Betaine also inhibited invivo angiogenesis in the mouse Matrigel plug assay . The mRNA expression levels of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2 ) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) in HUVECs were decreased by betaine treatment . In addition , betaine suppressed NF-kappaB and Akt activation .
The cadherins are a family of cell surface glycoproteins responsible for cell adhesion which play an important role in cell morphology , contact inhibition and signal transduction during tumorigenesis . Protocadherin 8 ( PCDH8 ) , a member of the cadherin family , has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor involved in oncogenesis in breast cancer . In this study , we aimed to investigate the epigenetic inactivation of PCDH8 and its tumor suppressor function in gastric cancer . The expression of PCDH8 was markedly reduced or silenced in gastric cancer cell lines compared with normal gastric cells or tissues . Methylation of the PCDH8 gene promoter was observed in 100% ( 4/4 ) of cell lines and 55.38% ( 36/65 ) of the primary gastric cancer by methylation-specific PCR , but not in normal gastric mucosa ( 0/10 ) . Methylated PCDH8 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis in a logistic regression analysis . The demethylation reagent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine was able to restore or upregulate PCDH8 expression in gastric cancer cell lines . Ectopic expression of PCDH8 in silenced gastric cancer cells significantly inhibited cell migration and induced apoptosis . For the first time , our study demonstrates the epigenetic inactivation of PCDH8 by promoter methylation and its tumor suppressor function in human gastric cancer . Thus , PCDH8 could be identified as a candidate tumor suppressor in human gastric cancer .
We examined how well the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) E6 oncogene can function in the absence of the E7 oncogene during the carcinogenic process in human keratinocytes using a common HPV variant strongly associated with cervical cancer : the Asian-American E6 variant ( AAE6 ) . This E6 variant is 20 times more frequently detected in cervical cancer than the prototype European E6 variant , as evidenced by independent epidemiological data . Using cell culture and cell-based functional assays , we assessed how this variant can perform crucial carcinogenesis steps compared to the prototype E6 variant . The ability to immortalize and transform primary human foreskin keratinocytes ( PHFKs ) to acquire resilient phenotypes and the ability to promote cell migration were evaluated . The immortalization capability was assayed based on population doublings , number of passages , surpassing mortality stages 1 and 2 , human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) expression , and the ability to overcome G(1) arrest via p53 degradation . Transformation and migration efficiency were analyzed using a combination of functional cell-based assays . We observed that either AAE6 or prototype E6 proteins alone were sufficient to immortalize PHFKs , although AAE6 was more potent in doing so . The AAE6 variant protein alone pushed PHFKs through transformation and significantly increased their migration ability over that of the E6 prototype . Our findings are in line with epidemiological data that the AA variant of HPV16 confers an increased risk over the European prototype for cervical cancer , as evidenced by a superior immortalization , transformation , and metastatic potential .
BACKGROUND Chemokines are involved in multiple aspects of pathogenesis and cellular trafficking in tumorigenesis . In this study , we report that the latest member of the C-X-C-type chemokines , CXCL17 ( DMC/VCC-1 ) , recruits immature myeloid-derived cells and enhances early tumor progression . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS CXCL17 was preferentially expressed in some aggressive types of gastrointestinal , breast , and lung cancer cells . CXCL17 expression did not impart NIH3T3 cells with oncogenic potential in vitro , but CXCL17-expressing NIH3T3 cells could form vasculature-rich tumors in immunodeficient mice . Our data showed that CXCL17-expressing tumor cells increased immature CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid-derived cells at tumor sites in mice and promoted CD31(+) tumor angiogenesis . Extensive chemotactic assays proved that CXCL17-responding cells were CD11b(+)Gr1(high)F4/80(-) cells ( =~ 90% ) with a neutrophil-like morphology in vitro . Although CXCL17 expression could not increase the number of CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cells in tumor-burdened SCID mice or promote metastases of low metastatic colon cancer cells , the existence of CXCL17-responding myeloid-derived cells caused a striking enhancement of xenograft tumor formation . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These results suggest that aberrant expression of CXCL17 in tumor cells recruits immature myeloid-derived cells and promotes tumor progression through angiogenesis .
UNLABELLED BACKGROUND We aimed to develop a mouse spontaneous liver metastasis model from an orthotopically implanted human colon cancer cell line stably expressing a human sodium/iodide symporter ( NIS ) reporter gene , which can be imaged with single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) using 99mTcO4- . METHODS A recombinant plasmid containing a constitutively driven NIS gene ( pcDNA3-NIS ) was transfected into the human colon cancer cell line HCT116 , and stable cell lines were established . The stable cells were subcutaneously injected into the nude mice . When the diameter reached 10 mm , the xenografts were excised , cut into small fragments , and orthotopically implanted into the cecal walls of another nude mice. 99mTcO4- SPECT/CT imaging was initiated 8 weeks later and repeated every 1 to 2 weeks . RESULTS The production and function of NIS protein was confirmed in vitro by Western blotting and 99mTcO4- uptake assay . On SPECT/CT imaging , focal 99mTcO4- uptake was detected in the liver . Necropsy revealed local growth of the orthotopic colon xenografts with extensive invasion , microscopic serosal metastasis , and metastatic foci in the corresponding hepatic regions showing focal 99mTcO4- uptake . Immunohistochemistry revealed high levels of NIS expression in cells forming liver tumor , indicating that the liver tumor cells originated from the orthotopic colon xenografts . CONCLUSIONS The present proof-of-concept study provided a rationale for employing a radionuclide reporter gene for the specific visualization of spontaneous liver metastasis in living mice . This unique animal model of clinically relevant and externally detectable liver metastasis will be a powerful tool for investigating tumor biology and developing novel therapies for cancer metastasis .
The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a member of the HER family receptors and its activation induced by its natural ligand EGF results in colon cancer growth and progression . Panitumumab ( pmAb ) is a fully human IgG2 anti-EGFR antibody that blocks the EGFR actions . In the present study , we evaluated the effects of pmAb on the EGF-mediated cellular responses in a panel of colon cancer cells ( HCT-8 , HT-29 , DLD-1 and HCT-116 ) . HCT-1116 and DLD-1 cells showed no significant EGF-dependent cell proliferation ; HT-29 and HCT-8 exhibited an EGF-dependent proliferation , with HCT-8 cells to be the most responsive with significant EGFR phosphorylation upon treatment with EGF . The effects of pmAb were then evaluated in the most EGF-responsive cells , HCT-8 . In that respect , pmAb impedes the signaling cascade mediated by EGFR intracellular phosphorylation and activity of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) as well as the EGF-induced invasive and migratory potential of colon cancer cells . At the level of matrix effectors implicated in colon cancer progression we report that pmAb is a potent inhibitor of constitute and EGF-mediated gene expression of certain matrix effectors , such as membrane-type 1 metalloproteinase ( MT1-MMP ) , extracellular metalloproteinases inducer ( EMMPRIN ) , urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and syndecan-4 . The obtained data demonstrated that pmAb is a specific blocker of EGF-mediated EGFR activation , resulting in a significant inhibition of colon cancer cell proliferation in early stages of growth , migration and invasiveness as well as of matrix effector implicated in cancer progression .
OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in cervical squamous carcinoma . METHODS Eighty cases of invasive cervical squamous cancer were selected as objects of our study . Double immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 and Ki-67 was used to label the lymphatic vessels and mark the proliferative lymphatic vessels in cervical squamous cancer . The peritumoral lymphatic vessel density and intratumoral lymphatic vessel density was assessed . The lymphatic vessels proliferation index was evaluated by calculating Ki-67 proliferation index ( PI ) to reflect the lymphangiogenesis of cervical squamous cancer . Then the correlation between lymphangiogenesis and clinicopathologic features of cervical squamous cancer was analyzed . RESULTS The LVD of cervical cancer ( 15.23 <FFFD> 3.6 ) was clearly higher than that of the adjacent normal cervical subepithelial tissues ( 9.9 <FFFD> 2.5 , P < 0.001 ) . The peritumoral lymphatic vessel density of cervical cancer ( 18.75 <FFFD> 4.3 ) was significantly higher than the intratumoral lymphatic vessel density of cervical cancer ( 11.71 <FFFD> 4.9 , P < 0.001 ) . Lymphatic PI ( LPI ) of cervical cancer ( 0.258 <FFFD> 0.07 ) was higher than that of the adjacent normal cervical subepithelial tissues ( 0.068 <FFFD> 0.08 , P < 0.001 ) . The peritumoral lymphatic vessel PI of cervical cancer ( 0.324 <FFFD> 0.06 ) was notably higher than the intratumoral lymphatic vessel PI of cervical cancer ( 0.232 <FFFD> 0.06 , P < 0.001 ) . Peritumoral lymphatic vessel density and peritumoral lymphatic vessel were clearly associated with the lymph node metastasis ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.002 , respectively ) and lymphovascular space invasion ( P = 0.024 and P = 0.01 , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS The high density of peritumoral lymphatic vessels is a potential predictor of more aggressive phenotype of cervical squamous cancer .
RASSF2 has recently been identified as a potential tumor suppressor that serves as a Ras effector in various types of human cancers . However , there have been few reports detailing this in gastric cancer . Samples of gastric adenocarcinoma from 276 Chinese patients with follow-up were analyzed for RASSF2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry . RASSF2 was expressed in up to 31.2% ( 86/276 ) of this group of gastric carcinoma . The expression of RASSF2 was significantly lower in carcinomas than in normal mucosas ( P<0.05 ) . RASSF2 corresponded positively with patient age , histological differentiation , depth of tumor invasion , regional lymph node and distant metastasis , and TNM stage ( all P<0.05 ) . Further multivariate analysis revealed that patient gender , depth of tumor invasion , distant metastasis , TNM stage and the expression of RASSF2 were independent prognostic factors for patients with gastric cancer . The Kaplan-Meier plot showed that the overall mean survival time of the patients with RASSF2-negative expression was shorter than that of patients with positive expression ( chi(2)=156.874 , P<0.0001 ) . Moreover , RASSF2-negative expression had a much more significant effect on the survival of those patients with early stage tumors ( chi(2)=127.167 , P<0.0001 ) , highlighted by a >50.9% reduction in 3-year survival compared to that of patients with RASSF2-positive expression . In late stages , the difference was also significant ( chi(2)=6.246 , P=0.019 ) , with a 35.5% reduction in 3-year survival . It is suggested that RASSF2 plays an important role in the evolution of gastric adenocarcinoma and should be considered as a potential marker for its prognosis .
BACKGROUND Coronins are a family of highly evolutionary conserved proteins reportedly involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics , although only coronin 3 has been shown to be related to cancer cell migration . In glioblastoma cells , the knockdown of coronin 3 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion . Coronin 3 is also associated with the aggression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma . In this paper , we analyze the migration , invasion and metastasis abilities of gastric cancer cells after up- or down-regulation of coronin 3 , and explore the mechanism of coronin 3 in the process of gastric cancer metastasis . RESULTS The expression of coronin 3 was higher in the highly metastatic sub-cell line MKN28-M , which we established in our laboratory . We also demonstrated that the expression of coronin 3 was remarkably higher in lymph lode metastases than in primary gastric cancer tissues , and over-expression of coronin 3 was correlated with the increased clinical stage and lymph lode metastasis . Recombinant lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs were designed to down-regulate coronin 3 expression in gastric cancer cell lines . Stable knockdown of coronin 3 by this lentiviral vector could efficiently inhibit the migration and invasion of MKN45 gastric cancer cells . In contrast , up-regulation of coronin 3 significantly enhanced migration and invasion of MKN28-NM cells . In addition , knockdown of coronin 3 significantly reduced liver metastasis in mice after tail vein injection of gastric cancer cells . The Human Tumor Metastasis PCR Array was used to screen the metastasis-associated genes identified by the down-regulation of coronin 3 , and the results suggested that , following the knockdown of coronin 3 , the tumor cell migration and invasion were inhibited by the reduced expression of MMP-9 and cathepsin K. CONCLUSION Coronin 3 is highly expressed in gastric cancer metastases and can promote the metastatic behaviors of gastric cancer cells , including their migration and invasion .
AIM To investigate whether luteolin , a highly prevalent flavonoid , reverses the effects of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) in vitro and in vivo and to determine the mechanisms underlying this reversal . METHODS Murine malignant melanoma B16F10 cells were exposed to 1% O(2) for 24 h . Cellular mobility and adhesion were assessed using Boyden chamber transwell assay and cell adhesion assay , respectively . EMT-related proteins , such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin , were examined using Western blotting . Female C57BL/6 mice ( 6 to 8 weeks old ) were injected with B16F10 cells ( 1<FFFD>10(6) cells in 0.2 mL per mouse ) via the lateral tail vein . The mice were treated with luteolin ( 10 or 20 mg/kg , ip ) daily for 23 d . On the 23rd day after tumor injection , the mice were sacrificed , and the lungs were collected , and metastatic foci in the lung surfaces were photographed . Tissue sections were analyzed with immunohistochemistry and HE staining . RESULTS Hypoxia changed the morphology of B16F10 cells in vitro from the cobblestone-like to mesenchymal-like strips , which was accompanied by increased cellular adhesion and invasion . Luteolin ( 5-50 mumol/L ) suppressed the hypoxia-induced changes in the cells in a dose-dependent manner . Hypoxia significantly decreased the expression of E-cadherin while increased the expression of N-cadherin in the cells ( indicating the occurrence of EMT-like transformation ) , which was reversed by luteolin ( 5 mumol/L ) . In B16F10 cells , luteolin up-regulated E-cadherin at least partly via inhibiting the beta3 integrin/FAK signal pathway . In experimental metastasis model mice , treatment with luteolin ( 10 or 20 mg/kg ) reduced metastatic colonization in the lungs by 50% . Furthermore , the treatment increased the expression of E-cadherin while reduced the expression of vimentin and beta3 integrin in the tumor tissues . CONCLUSION Luteolin inhibits the hypoxia-induced EMT in malignant melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo via the regulation of beta3 integrin , suggesting that luteolin may be applied as a potential anticancer chemopreventative and chemotherapeutic agent .
UNLABELLED Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is a major liver malignancy . We previously demonstrated that deregulation of epigenetic regulators is a common event in human HCC . Suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 ( SUV39H1 ) , the prototype of histone methyltransferase , is the major enzyme responsible for histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation , which , essentially , is involved in heterochromatin formation , chromosome segregation , and mitotic progression . However , the implication of SUV39H1 in hepatocarcinogenesis remains elusive . In this study , we found that SUV39H1 was frequently up-regulated in human HCCs and was significantly associated with increased Ki67 expression ( P < 0.001 ) and the presence of venous invasion ( P = 0.017 ) . To investigate the role of SUV39H1 in HCC development , both gain- and loss-of-function models were established . SUV39H1 overexpression remarkably enhanced HCC cell clonogenicity , whereas knockdown of SUV39H1 substantially suppressed HCC cell proliferation and induced cell senescence . In addition , ectopic expression of SUV39H1 increased the migratory ability of HCC cells , whereas a reduced migration rate was observed in SUV39H1 knockdown cells . The significance of SUV39H1 in HCC was further demonstrated in a nude mice model ; SUV39H1 knockdown drastically inhibited in vivo tumorigenicity and abolished pulmonary metastasis of HCC cells . We also identified microRNA-125b ( miR-125b ) as a post-transcriptional regulator of SUV39H1 . Ectopic expression of miR-125b inhibited SUV39H1 3'-untranslated-region-coupled luciferase activity and suppressed endogenous SUV39H1 expression at both messenger RNA and protein levels . We have previously reported frequent down-regulation of miR-125b in HCC . Interestingly , miR-125b level was found to be inversely correlated with SUV39H1 expression ( P = 0.001 ) in clinical specimens . Our observations suggested that miR-125b down-regulation may account for the aberrant SUV39H1 level in HCC . CONCLUSION Our study demonstrated that SUV39H1 up-regulation contributed to HCC development and metastasis . The tumor-suppressive miR-125b served as a negative regulator of SUV39H1 .
ABSTRACT : INTRODUCTION : Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation steps in the process of breast cancer metastasis , the primary cause of breast cancer morbidity and death . Here we investigated the role of p21Cip1 ( p21 ) , a member of the core cell cycle machinery , in transforming growth factor-beta ( TGFbeta)-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion . METHODS : A mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model was used to assess the mammary tumor growth and local invasion . The triple negative human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231 and its sub-progenies SCP2 and SCP25 , SUM159PT , SUM149PT , SUM229PE and SUM1315MO2 were treated with 5 ng/ml TGFbeta and the protein expression levels were measured by Western blot . Cell migration and invasion were examined using the scratch/wound healing and Transwell assay . TGFbeta transcriptional activity was measured by a TGFbeta/Smad reporter construct ( CAGA12-luc ) using luciferase assay. q-PCR was used for assessing TGFbeta downstream target genes . The interactions among p21 , p/CAF and Smad3 were performed by co-immunoprecipitation . In addition , Smad3 on DNA binding ability was measured by DNA immunoprecipitation using biotinylated Smad binding element DNA probes . Finally , the association among active TGFbeta/Smad signaling , p21 and p/CAF with lymph node metastasis was examined by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarray containing 50 invasive ductal breast tumors , 25 of which are lymph node positive . RESULTS : We found p21 expression to correlate with poor overall and distant metastasis free survival in breast cancer patients . Furthermore , using xenograft animal models and in vitro studies , we found p21 to be essential for tumor cell invasion . The invasive effects of p21 were found to correlate with Smad3 , and p/CAF interaction downstream of TGFbeta. p21 and p/CAF regulates TGFbeta-mediated transcription of pro-metastatic genes by controlling Smad3 acetylation , DNA binding and transcriptional activity . In addition , we found that active TGFbeta/Smad signaling correlates with high p21 and p/CAF expression levels and lymph node involvement using tissue microarrays from breast cancer patients . CONCLUSIONS : Together these results highlight an important role for p21 and p/CAF in promoting breast cancer cell migration and invasion at the transcriptional level and may open new avenues for breast cancer therapy .
TGF-beta derived from bone fuels melanoma bone metastases by inducing tumor secretion of prometastatic factors that act on bone cells to change the skeletal microenvironment . Halofuginone is a plant alkaloid derivative that blocks TGF-beta signaling with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties . Here , we show for the first time that halofuginone therapy decreases development and progression of bone metastasis caused by melanoma cells through the inhibition of TGF-beta signaling . Halofuginone treatment of human melanoma cells inhibited cell proliferation , phosphorylation of SMAD proteins in response to TGF-beta , and TGF-beta-induced SMAD-driven transcription . In addition , halofuginone reduced expression of TGF-beta target genes that enhance bone metastases , including PTHrP , CTGF , CXCR4 , and IL11 . Also , cell apoptosis was increased in response to halofuginone . In nude mice inoculated with 1205Lu melanoma cells , a preventive protocol with halofuginone inhibited bone metastasis . The beneficial effects of halofuginone treatment were comparable with those observed with other anti-TGF-beta strategies , including systemic administration of SD208 , a small-molecule inhibitor of TGF-beta receptor I kinase , or forced overexpression of Smad7 , a negative regulator of TGF-beta signaling . Furthermore , mice with established bone metastases treated with halofuginone had significantly less osteolysis than mice receiving placebo assessed by radiography . Thus , halofuginone is also effective in reducing the progression of melanoma bone metastases . Moreover , halofuginone treatment reduced melanoma metastasis to the brain , showing the potential of this novel treatment against cancer metastasis . Cancer Res ; 72(23) ; 6247-56. <FFFD>2012 AACR .
AIM To assess the prognostic significance of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and its target genes in gastric cancer . METHODS The tumor tissues of 115 patients with gastric cancer were immunohistochemically evaluated using monoclonal antibodies against NF-kappaB RelA . Preoperative serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) were assessed via enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay . C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and serum amyloid A ( SAA ) were measured via immunotrubidimetry . RESULTS Positive rate of NF-kappaB RelA was 42.6% . NF-kappaB RelA expression in tumor tissues was also related to serum levels of IL-6 ( P = 0.044 ) and CRP ( P = 0.010 ) . IL-6 , SAA , CRP were related to depth of invasion , VEGF and SAA were correlated with lymph node metastasis . IL-6 , VEGF , SAA and CRP were related to the stage . Univariate analysis demonstrated that immunostaining of NF-kappaB RelA , levels of IL-6 , VEGF , SAA were significantly related with both disease free survival and overall survival ( OS ) . Multivariate analysis verified that NF-kappaB RelA [ hazard ratio ( HR ) : 3.40 , P = 0.024 ] and SAA ( HR : 3.39 , P = 0.045 ) were independently associated with OS . CONCLUSION Increased expression of NF-kappaB RelA and high levels of serum SAA were associated with poor OS in gastric cancer patients .
Formononetin is a novel herbal isoflavonoid isolated from Astragalus membranaceus , a medicinal plant that possesses antitumorigenic properties . Our previous findings demonstrated that formononetin initiates growth-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic activities in human colon cancer cells . In the present study , we aimed to further examine the potential of formononetin in controlling angiogenesis and tumor cell invasiveness in human colon cancer cells and tumor xenografts . The results showed that formononetin downregulated the expression of the key pro-angiogenic factors , including vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and matrix metalloproteinases . We also discovered that the invasiveness of metastatic colon cancer cells was alleviated following drug treatment . The potential anti-angiogenic effect of formononetin was examined in nude mouse xenografts . The tumor size and the number of proliferating cells were reduced in the tumor tissues obtained from the formononetin-treated group . The serum VEGF level was also reduced in the drug-treated animals when compared to the controls . These findings suggest that formononetin inhibits angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion , and thus support its use in the treatment of advanced and metastatic colon cancers .
Metastasis is a complex process utilizing both tumor-cell-autonomous properties and host-derived factors , including cellular immunity . We have previously shown that germline polymorphisms can modify tumor cell metastatic capabilities through cell-autonomous mechanisms . However , how metastasis susceptibility genes interact with the tumor stroma is incompletely understood . Here , we employ a complex genetic screen to identify Cadm1 as a novel modifier of metastasis . We demonstrate that Cadm1 can specifically suppress metastasis without affecting primary tumor growth . Unexpectedly , Cadm1 did not alter tumor-cell-autonomous properties such as proliferation or invasion , but required the host's adaptive immune system to affect metastasis . The metastasis-suppressing effect of Cadm1 was lost in mice lacking T cell-mediated immunity , which was partially phenocopied by depleting CD8(+) T cells in immune-competent mice . Our data show a novel function for Cadm1 in suppressing metastasis by sensitizing tumor cells to immune surveillance mechanisms , and this is the first report of a heritable metastasis susceptibility gene engaging tumor non-autonomous factors .
In patients with advanced bladder cancer , glucocorticoids are frequently given to reduce acute toxicity , particularly hyperemesis , during chemotherapy , as well as to improve cachectic conditions . However , it remains unclear whether glucocorticoids directly affect the development and progression of bladder cancer through the glucocorticoid receptor pathway . Glucocorticoid receptor expression was first investigated in human bladder cancer lines and tissue microarrays . Then , the effects of dexamethasone on glucocorticoid receptor transcription , cell proliferation , apoptosis/cell cycle , and invasion were examined in bladder cancer lines . Finally , mouse xenograft models for bladder cancer were used to assess the efficacy of dexamethasone on tumor progression . All the cell lines and tissues examined were found to express glucocorticoid receptor . Dexamethasone increased glucocorticoid receptor-mediated reporter activity and cell proliferation , and inhibited apoptosis in the presence or absence of cisplatin . In contrast , dexamethasone suppressed cell invasion , the expression of its related genes [ MMP-2/MMP-9 , interleukin ( IL)-6 , VEGF ] , and the activity of MMP-2/MMP-9 , and also induced mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition . In addition , dexamethasone increased IkappaBalpha protein levels and cytosolic accumulation of NF-kappaB . In xenograft-bearing mice , dexamethasone slightly augmented the growth of the inoculated tumors but completely prevented the development of bloody ascites , suggestive of peritoneal dissemination of tumor cells , and actual metastasis . In all these assays , dexamethasone effects were abolished by a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist or glucocorticoid receptor knockdown via RNA interference . Thus , glucocorticoid receptor activation resulted in promotion of cell proliferation via inhibiting apoptosis yet repression of cell invasion and metastasis . These results may provide a basis of developing improved chemotherapy regimens , including or excluding glucocorticoid receptor agonists/antagonists , for urothelial carcinoma .
BACKGROUND Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive form of malignant glioma and is very difficult to treat . Controlling tumour cell invasion and angiogenesis is essential to improve the prognosis of glioblastoma patients . Since constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) is necessary for tumour progression , NF-kappaB may be an important pharmacological target for this disease . Our study aimed to evaluate the antitumour effects of parthenolide , a NF-kappaB inhibitor , in two human glioblastoma cell lines ( U87MG and U373 ) and in glioblastoma xenografts . Furthermore , we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects . METHODS The anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic effects of parthenolide were analysed using in vitro invasion and angiogenesis assays . Parthenolide-induced growth inhibition of glioblastoma cells in vitro was determined using the MTT ( methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ) assay . In addition , the effect of parthenolide on orthotropic implantation in vivo was evaluated using an intracerebral human glioblastoma xenograft model . RESULTS We found that parthenolide suppresses proliferation , invasion , and tumour- induced angiogenesis of glioblastoma cells . Molecular studies demonstrated that parthenolide suppresses gene and protein expression of angiogenic factors . Furthermore , parthenolide reduced Akt phosphorylation and activated mitochondrial signalling , suggesting that the antitumour function of parthenolide may be mediated not only by the inhibition of NF-kappaB but also by the inhibition of Akt signalling and the activation of apoptotic proteins . Parthenolide suppressed neovascularity and tumour growth in glioblastoma xenografts . CONCLUSION The present study identified parthenolide as a new therapeutic agent for glioblastomas .
The orphan receptor TR3 is an important regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis . However , whether TR3 is involved in regulating the stem-like properties of cancer cells remains unknown . The present study shows that TR3 expression is increased in gastric tumorsphere cells and is positively correlated with cancer stem cell ( CSC ) characteristics . Knocking down TR3 leads to the suppression of its stem-like properties in both gastric cancer cells and tumorsphere cells . This process involves the decreased expression of the stemness-related genes Oct-4 and Nanog and the invasion-related gene MMP-9 . We further identify Nanog as a new target for the transcription factor TR3 . Together , these data demonstrate for the first time that TR3 is essential for the maintenance of stem-like properties in human gastric cancer cells and implicate TR3 as a new therapeutic target for gastric cancer .
Human podoplanin is a type-1 transmembrane sialomucin-like glycoprotein that is involved in cell migration , tumor cell invasion and metastasis . Our recent study of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) demonstrated that the degree of immunohistochemical expression of podoplanin was correlated with the severity of epithelial dysplasia and significantly associated with a poor pathologic grade of differentiation . Furthermore , it has been reported that Src directly associates with the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in OSCC cells upon stimulation with EGF and phosphorylates Crk-associated substrate ( Cas ) , podoplanin acting downstream of Src and Cas to promote cell migration . However , the molecular function of podoplanin remains unclear . In this study we performed real-time RT-PCR , Western blotting and scratch assay using OSCC cell lines in order to clarify the molecular biological function of podoplanin expression associated with various growth factors including EGF and with the Src-Cas signaling pathway . Podoplanin was found to have a marked influence on cancer cell migration and the expression of matrix metalloprotease-9 ( MMP-9 ) in the oral cavity upon stimulation with EGF . Podoplanin promotes oral cancer cell migration , and the EGF-Src-Cas pathway is one of the possible mechanisms responsible for progression of cancer in the oral cavity .
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a fundamental process governing morphogenesis in multicellular organisms and has recently been implicated in promoting carcinoma invasion and metastasis . Besides their therapeutic effects , accumulating evidences suggest that chemotherapeutic agents also induced EMT and enhanced the malignancy of treated cancer cells ; however , the mechanism(s) still remains unclear . Here , we investigated the role of beta-catenin signaling in doxorubicin ( Dox)-induced EMT in human gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 . We found that the transient treatment of Dox induced EMT and enhanced the in vitro migration ability of cancer cells . We also found that beta-catenin signaling was activated upon Dox treatment . Inhibition of beta-catenin by indomethacin ( Indo ) or siRNA suppressed Dox-induced EMT and decreased cancer cell migration ability . Our results showed that beta-catenin signaling was critical to Dox-induced EMT . Indo and other beta-catenin inhibitors may have a potential implication in prevention of gastric cancer metastasis .
Liver metastasis from colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality . Myeloid cells play pivotal roles in the metastatic process , but their prometastatic functions in liver metastasis remain incompletely understood . To investigate their role , we simulated liver metastasis in C57BL/6 mice through intrasplenic inoculation of MC38 colon carcinoma cells . Among the heterogeneous myeloid infiltrate , we identified a distinct population of CD11b/Gr1(mid) cells different from other myeloid populations previously associated with liver metastasis . These cells increased in number dramatically during establishment of liver metastases and were recruited from bone marrow by tumor-derived CCL2 . Liver metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma cells followed this pattern but this mechanism is not universal as liver colonization by B16F1 melanoma cells did not recruit similar subsets . Inhibition of CCL2 signaling and absence of its cognate receptor CCR2 reduced CD11b/Gr1(mid) recruitment and decreased tumor burden . Depletion of the CD11b/Gr1(mid) subset in a transgenic CD11b-diphtheria toxin receptor mouse model markedly reduced tumor cell proliferation . There was no evidence for involvement of an adaptive immune response in the prometastatic effects of CD11b/Gr1(mid) cells . Additionally , an analogous myeloid subset was found in liver metastases of some colorectal cancer patients . Conclusion : Collectively , our findings highlight the importance of myeloid cells-in this case a selective CD11b/Gr1(mid) subset-in sustaining development of colorectal cancer liver metastasis and identify a potential target for antimetastatic therapy .

BACKGROUND Patients with invasive breast ductal carcinoma ( IBDC ) with metastasis have a very poor prognosis . Little is known about the synergistic action of growth and inflammatory factors in IBDC metastases . METHODS The expression of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 ( phosphorylated or p-ERK1/2 ) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in IBDC tissue samples from 80 cases . BT474 IBDC cell migration and invasion were quantified using the Transwell assay . Matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-9 expression and activity were analyzed by RT-PCR , Western blotting and zymography . Activator protein ( AP)-1 activity was measured with a luciferase reporter gene assay . The Wilcoxon signed-rank test , Chi-square test , the partition of Chi-square test , independent t-test , and Spearman's method were used for the statistical analysis . RESULTS Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected in 58/80 ( 72.5% ) IBDC tissues , and was associated with higher TNM stage and lymph node metastasis , but not patient age or tumor size . Individually , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , and interleukin ( IL)-1beta activated ERK1/2 , increased cell migration and invasion , MMP-9 expression and activity , AP-1 activation in vitro and the expression of p-ERK1/2 was positively correlated with EGF expression levels , as well as IL-1beta , MMP-9 and c-fos in IBDC tissue samples . Co-stimulation with EGF and IL-1beta synergistically increased ERK1/2 and AP-1 activation , cell migration and invasion , and MMP-9 expression and activity . Inhibition of ERK1/2 using U0126 or siRNA abolished EGF and/or IL-1beta-induced cell migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner . CONCLUSION Activated ERK1/2 was associated with higher TNM stage and lymph node metastasis in IBDC . Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that ERK-1/2 activation may increase the metastatic ability of IBDC cells . Growth and inflammatory factors synergistically induced IBDC cell migration and invasion via ERK1/2 signaling , AP-1 activation and MMP-9 upregulation .
PURPOSE Recently , a new renal cell cancer syndrome has been linked to germline mutation of multiple subunits ( SDHB/C/D ) of the Krebs cycle enzyme , succinate dehydrogenase . We report our experience with the diagnosis , evaluation and treatment of this novel form of hereditary kidney cancer . MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with suspected hereditary kidney cancer were enrolled on a National Cancer Institute institutional review board approved protocol to study inherited forms of kidney cancer . Individuals from families with germline SDHB , SDHC and SDHD mutations , and kidney cancer underwent comprehensive clinical and genetic evaluation . RESULTS A total of 14 patients from 12 SDHB mutation families were evaluated . Patients presented with renal cell cancer at an early age ( 33 years , range 15 to 62 ) , metastatic kidney cancer developed in 4 and some families had no manifestation other than kidney tumors . An additional family with 6 individuals found to have clear cell renal cell cancer that presented at a young average age ( 47 years , range 40 to 53 ) was identified with a germline SDHC mutation ( R133X ) Metastatic disease developed in 2 of these family members . A patient with a history of carotid body paragangliomas and an aggressive form of kidney cancer was evaluated from a family with a germline SDHD mutation . CONCLUSIONS SDH mutation associated renal cell carcinoma can be an aggressive type of kidney cancer , especially in younger individuals . Although detection and management of early tumors is most often associated with a good outcome , based on our initial experience with these patients and our long-term experience with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma , we recommend careful surveillance of patients at risk for SDH mutation associated renal cell carcinoma and wide surgical excision of renal tumors .
Angiogenesis is a crucial step in the growth and metastasis of cancers , since it enables the growing tumor to receive oxygen and nutrients . Cancer prevention using natural products has become an integral part of cancer control . We studied the antiangiogenic activity of quercetin using ex vivo , in vivo and in vitro models . Rat aortic ring assay showed that quercetin at non-toxic concentrations significantly inhibited microvessel sprouting and exhibited a significant inhibition in the proliferation , migration , invasion and tube formation of endothelial cells , which are key events in the process of angiogenesis . Most importantly , quercetin treatment inhibited ex vivo angiogenesis as revealed by chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane assay ( CAM ) and matrigel plug assay . Western blot analysis showed that quercetin suppressed VEGF induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 and their downstream protein kinases AKT , mTOR , and ribosomal protein S6 kinase in HUVECs . Quercetin ( 20 mg/kg/d ) significantly reduced the volume and the weight of solid tumors in prostate xenograft mouse model , indicating that quercetin inhibited tumorigenesis by targeting angiogenesis . Furthermore , quercetin reduced the cell viability and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells , which were correlated with the downregulation of AKT , mTOR and P70S6K expressions . Collectively the findings in the present study suggest that quercetin inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis by targeting VEGF-R2 regulated AKT/mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway , and could be used as a potential drug candidate for cancer therapy .
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the risk factors for sentinel lymph node metastasis and validate the value of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram for the prediction of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients . METHODS A sentinel lymph node biopsy database containing 1227 consecutive breast cancer patients ( 416 patients with at least one positive sentinel lymph node ) was retrospectively analyzed . The predictive value of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram was calculated by the trend line and the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve . Meanwhile , predictors for sentinel lymph node metastasis were also evaluated . RESULTS Tumor size , histological grade , lymphovascular invasion , mulifocality , estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status were significant independent predictors for sentinel lymph node metastasis ( all P<0.01 ) . The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram presented an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve value of 0.730 . Patients with predictive value<16% had a frequency of sentinel lymph node metastasis of 0.9% . Those with values larger than 70% had a frequency of 96.2% . CONCLUSIONS The risk factors for sentinel lymph node metastasis in our study were consistent with those in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram . The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram is a useful tool that could accurately predict the probability of sentinel lymph node metastasis in our breast cancer patients . Axillary surgical staging might be avoided in patients with a predictive value of <16% and axillary lymph node dissection might be done directly in those with a predictive value >70% , while other patients should still accept sentinel lymph node biopsy .
Blockage of the metastasis process remains a significant clinical challenge , requiring innovative therapeutic approaches . For this purpose , molecules that inhibit matrix metalloproteinases activity or induce the expression of their natural inhibitor , the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) , are potentially interesting . In a previous study , we have shown that synthetic ligands binding to cell surface nucleolin/nucleophosmin and known as HB 19 for the lead compound and NucAnt 6L ( N6L ) for the most potent analog , inhibit both tumor growth and angiogenesis . Furthermore , they prevent metastasis in a RET transgenic mice model which develops melanoma . Here , we investigated the effect of N6L on the invasion capacity of MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells . Our results show that the multivalent pseudopeptide N6L inhibited Matrigel invasion of MDA-MB-435 cells in a modified Boyden chamber model . This was associated with an increase in TIMP-3 in the cell culture medium without a change in TIMP-3 mRNA expression suggesting its release from cell surface and/or extracellular matrix . This may be explained by our demonstrated N6L interaction with sulfated glycosaminoglycans and consequently the controlled bioavailability of glycosaminoglycan-bound TIMP-3 . The implication of TIMP-3 in N6L-induced inhibition of cell invasion was evidenced by siRNA silencing experiments showing that the loss of TIMP-3 expression abrogated the effect of N6L . The inhibition of tumor cell invasion by N6L demonstrated in this study , in addition to its previously established inhibitory effect on tumor growth and angiogenesis , suggests that N6L represents a promising anticancer drug candidate warranting further investigation .
Molecular mechanisms involved in progression of clear-cell renal-cell carcinomas ( ccRCCs ) are poorly understood . A common genetic mutation found in ccRCC is the loss of the von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) gene , which contributes to cancer progression and metastasis . We investigated VIP effects on metastatic and angiogenic factors in human VHL-null A498 ccRCC and HK2 renal cells . VIP increased adhesion but decreased expression of metalloproteinases , MMP2 and MMP9 , as well as cell migration and VEGF expression and secretion in A498 but not in HK2 cells . VIP enhanced ROS levels and decreased nuclear levels of beta-catenin and NFkappaB p50-subunit in A498 cells , suggesting neuropeptide involvement in the observed decrease of metastatic ability in clear-cell carcinoma . VIP effects in A498 cells were blocked by the VPAC(1/2)-receptor antagonist JV-1-53 . In conclusion , present data point to a role of VIP in preventing invasion and metastasis in ccRCCs and support its potential therapeutic usefulness in this disease .
BACKGROUND Dickkopf-related protein 1 ( DKK1 ) has been reported involved in metastasis and invasion in several tumors . This study sought to investigate the prognostic value of DKK1 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC ) and its role in promoting ICC metastasis . METHODS Tissue microarrays of 138 ICC patient samples were employed to detect DKK1 , vascular endothelial growth factor C ( VEGF-C ) , and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP9 ) expression using immunohistochemistry . The prognostic significances were assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival estimates . DKK1 expression was measured in an ICC cell line ( HCCC-9810 ) and ICC tissues by immunofluorescence assay , quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction , and western blot . Serum levels of DKK1 from 37 ICC patients were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . The role of DKK1 in proliferation , migration , invasion , and gene expression regulation was assessed by DKK1 depletion using small interfering RNA . RESULTS Multivariate analyses revealed that DKK1 was an unfavorable predictor for overall survival and time to recurrence . The prognostic significance was retained in ICC patients with low recurrence risk ( P < .05 ) . DKK1 expression was elevated in an ICC cell line , tumor samples , and patient sera . High levels of DKK1 in ICC tissues correlated with elevated MMP9 , VEGF-C , and metastasis of hepatic hilar lymph nodes . DKK1 depletion caused a decrease in cell migration and invasiveness , and down-regulation of MMP9 and VEGF-C expression . CONCLUSIONS DKK1 is a novel prognostic biomarker for ICC , and it enhances tumor cell invasion and promotes lymph node metastasis of ICC through the induction of MMP9 and VEGF-C . DKK1 may be a potential therapeutic target for ICC .
A prominent feature of inflammatory diseases is endothelial dysfunction . Factors associated with endothelial dysfunction include proinflammatory cytokines , adhesion molecules , and matrix degrading enzymes . At the transcriptional level , they are regulated by the histone deacetylase sirtuin ( SIRT ) 1 via its actions on the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) . The role of SIRT6 , also a histone deacetylase , in regulating inflammation in endothelial cells is not known . The aim of this study was to determine the effect of SIRT6 knockdown on inflammatory markers in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) in the presence of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . LPS decreased expression of SIRT6 in HUVECs . Knockdown of SIRT6 increased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-1beta , IL-6 , IL-8 ) , COX-prostaglandin system , ECM remodelling enzymes ( MMP-2 , MMP-9 and PAI-1 ) , the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 , and proangiogenic growth factors VEGF and FGF-2 ; cell migration ; cell adhesion to leukocytes . Loss of SIRT6 increased the expression of NF-kappaB , whereas overexpression of SIRT6 was associated with decreased NF-kappaB transcriptional activity . Taken together , these results demonstrate that the loss of SIRT6 in endothelial cells is associated with upregulation of genes involved in inflammation , vascular remodelling , and angiogenesis . SIRT6 may be a potential pharmacological target for inflammatory vascular diseases .
Aberrant expression of mucins is likely associated with cancer biology as alterations in the expression and/or glycosylation patterns of various mucins have been noted . Expression of the mucin family in gastric cancers has been reported in numerous studies , but the results are conflicting . Therefore , we investigated the potential use of mucin ( MUC)1 and 4 as prognostic markers in gastric cancer according to histological subtype . Three-hundred and sixty-five gastric adenocarcinoma patients who underwent surgical resection were selected for this study . Among the 365 gastric cancer samples tested here , 34% consisted of early gastric cancer and 66% were advanced . In terms of location , 68.7% of the cohort had intestinal-type cancer and 30.7% had diffuse-type . We constructed tissue microarrays with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks of gastric cancer and these micro-arrays were evaluated for phenotypic expression of MUC1/4 using monoclonal antibodies . Two-hundred and ninety-two patients ( 92.7% ) were positive for MUC1 and 216 ( 60.5% ) were positive for MUC4 . MUC1 expression was not correlated with any other clinicopathological variables such as age , gender , depth of invasion , lymph node metastasis , Lauren classification or recurrence . However , loss of MUC4 expression was significantly correlated with recurrence ( p=0.033 ) . MUC4 expression was also significantly correlated with better disease-free survival ( p=0.049 ) and particularly in the intestinal-type ( p=0.018 ) . Our present findings demonstrated that loss of MUC4 expression can be used as a prognostic marker in gastric cancer . Loss of MUC4 expression is a prognostic indicator of increased recurrence and poor disease-free survival in patients with gastric cancer .
To investigate whether altered energy metabolism induces the Warburg effect and results in tumor malignancy , the respiratory enzyme citrate synthase ( CS ) was examined , silenced , and the effects analyzed . In human cervical carcinoma cells , RNAi-mediated CS knockdown induced morphological changes characteristic of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . This switch accelerated cancer cell metastasis and proliferation in in vitro assays and in vivo tumor xenograft models . Notably , CS knockdown cells exhibited severe defects in respiratory activity and marked decreases in ATP production , but great increases in glycolytic metabolism . This malignant progression was due to activation of EMT-related regulators ; altered energy metabolism resulted from deregulation of the p53/TIGAR and SCO2 pathways . This phenotypic change was completely reversed by p53 reactivation via treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 or co-knockdown of E3 ligase HDM2 and partially suppressed by ATP treatment . This study directly links the Warburg effect to tumor malignancy via induction of the EMT phenotype .
We previously found that cancer metastasis is accelerated by immunosuppression during Snail-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . However , the molecular mechanism still remained unclear . Here , we demonstrate that CCL2 is a critical determinant for both tumor metastasis and immunosuppression induced by Snail(+) tumor cells . CCL2 is significantly upregulated in various human tumor cells accompanied by Snail expression induced by snail transduction or TGFbeta treatment . The Snail(+) tumor-derived CCL2 amplifies EMT events in other cells including Snail(-) tumor cells and epithelial cells within tumor microenvironment . CCL2 secondarily induces Lipocalin 2 ( LCN2 ) in the Snail(+) tumor cells in an autocrine manner . CCL2 and LCN2 cooperatively generate immunoregulatory dendritic cells ( DCreg ) having suppressive activity accompanied by lowered expression of costimulatory molecules such as HLA-DR but increased expression of immunosuppressive molecules such as PD-L1 in human PBMCs . The CCL2/LCN2-induced DCreg cells subsequently induce immunosuppressive CD4(+)FOXP3(+) Treg cells , and finally impair tumor-specific CTL induction . In murine established tumor model , however , CCL2 blockade utilizing the specific siRNA or neutralizing mAb significantly inhibits Snail(+) tumor growth and metastasis following systemic induction of anti-tumor immune responses in host . These results suggest that CCL2 is more than a chemoattractant factor that is the significant effector molecule responsible for immune evasion of Snail(+) tumor cells . CCL2 would be an attractive target for treatment to eliminate cancer cells via amelioration of tumor metastasis and immunosuppression .
Thrombospondin-1 is a matricellular protein with potent antitumour activities , the levels of which determine the fate of many different tumours , including renal carcinomas . However , the factors that regulate this protein remain unclear . In renal carcinomas , hypoxic conditions enhance the expression of angiogenic factors that help adapt tumour cells to their hostile environment . Therefore , we hypothesized that anti-angiogenic factors should correspondingly be dampened . Indeed , we found that hypoxia decreased the thrombospondin-1 protein in several clear cell renal carcinoma cell lines ( ccRCC ) , although no transcriptional regulation was observed . Furthermore , we proved that hypoxia stimulates multiple signals that independently contribute to diminish thrombospondin-1 in ccRCC , which include a decrease in the activity of oxygen-dependent prolylhydroxylases ( PHDs ) and activation of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway . In addition , thrombospondin-1 regulation in hypoxia proved to be important for ccRCC cell migration and invasion .
Metastasis is a major cause of death of patients with malignant tumors . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are important for the migration and invasion of various types of cancer cell . Propofol is a known anesthetic agent , widely used for short-term anesthesia and for longer-term sedation . Propofol inhibits the proliferation of a variety of tumor cells , but there is no available information regarding propofol-inhibited migration and invasion of tumor cells in vitro . In this study , we investigated the effects of propofol on the migration and invasion of human lung carcinoma A549 cells . Wound healing assay and Boyden chamber assays indicated that propofol inhibited the migration and invasion of A549 cells in vitro . Gelatin zymographic analysis showed the inhibitory effect of propofol on the activation of expression MMP-2 . Western blot analysis also indicated that propofol suppressed the protein expiration of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 ( GRB2 ) , Jun N-terminal kinases 1/2 ( p-JNK1/2 ) , p-p38 , MMP-2 and MMP-9 in A549 cells . Results from real-time PCR assay also showed that propofol inhibited the mRNA gene expression of MMP-2 , -7 and -9 , and enhanced that of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 ( TIMP1 ) and TIMP2 in A549 cells . Taken together , these data show that propofol inhibits MMP-2 and -9 mRNA and protein expressions , resulting in suppression of lung cancer cell invasion and migration in vitro .
OBJECTIVE To study the mechanism of interleukin 7/interleukin 7 receptor ( IL-7/IL-7R ) in promoting cell proliferation and inducing lymphangiogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) in vivo and in vitro . METHODS Immunohistochemical study for IL-7 , IL-7R , cyclin D1 and vascular endothelial growth factor-D ( VEGF-D ) was carried out in NSCLC tissues from 95 patients . The relationship between IL-7/IL-7R expression and various parameters was analyzed . The mechanism of IL-7/IL-7R in promoting cell proliferation and inducing lymphangiogenesis was studied by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide , fluorescence-activated cell sorting , reverse transcriptase-PCR , Western blot , co-immunoprecipitation , chromatin immunoprecipitation and nude mice experiments with xenograft tumors . RESULTS IL-7 ( 63.2% , 60/95 ) , IL-7R ( 61.1% , 58/95 ) , cyclin D1 ( 52.6% , 50/95 ) and VEGF-D ( 58.9% , 56/95 ) showed that high level of expression in NSCLC . IL-7/IL-7R over-expression correlated with cyclin D1 expression ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.01 ) , VEGF-D expression ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.01 ) , increased lymphovascular density ( P = 0.005 , P = 0.013 ) , advanced clinical stage ( P = 0.008 , P = 0.005 ) and presence of lymph node metastasis ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.01 ) . IL-7/IL-7R could promote proliferation of A549 cell , increase cyclin D1 and VEGF-D expression , and enhance c-Fos/c-Jun expression and phosphorylation , resulting in formation of heterodimer . Furthermore , IL-7/IL-7R could induce binding of c-Fos/c-Jun to cyclin D1/VEGF-D promoters and regulate their transcription . IL-7/IL-7R could also promote proliferation and lymphangiogenesis of lung cancer xenograft tumors . CONCLUSIONS IL-7/IL-7R promotes c-Fos/c-Jun expression and activity in NSCLC . This further facilitates cyclin D1 expression and accelerates proliferation of cells and VEGF-D-induced lymphovascular formation .
Breast cancer causes death due to distant metastases in which tumor cells produce matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) enzymes which facilitate invasion . Oleuropein , the main olive oil polyphenol , has anti-proliferative effects . This study aimed to investigate the effect of oleuropein on the metastatic and anti-metastatic gene expression in the MDA human breast cancer cell line . We evaluated the MMPs and TIMPs gene expression by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) in treated and untreated cells . This study demonstrated that OL may induce anti-metastatic effects on human breast cancer cells . We found that TIMP1,-3 , and -4 were over-expressed after all periods of incubation in treated cancer cells compared to untreated cells , while MMP2 and MMP9 genes were down-regulated , at least initially . Treatment of breast cancer cells with oleuropein could help in prevention of cancer metastasis by increasing the TIMPs and suppressing the MMPs gene expressions .
OBJECTIVE To explore the clinical significance of miRNA-216a expression in pancreatic cancer . METHODS Fourteen patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy and 6 patients with benign pancreas lesions were examined for miR-216a expressions in the tumor or lesion tissues using Agilent Human miRNA Microarray ( V12.0 ) . The relationship between miR-216a expressions and the clinicopathological features of the patients was analyzed . RESULTS The expression of miRNA-216a was significantly lower in pancreatic cancer than in benign pancreas lesions ( P=0.000 ) . The expression of miRNA-216a was significantly correlated with the T stage of the tumor ( P=0.002 ) , but not with the patients ' age , gender , smoking status , tumor stage , lymph node metastases , distant metastasis , tumor differentiation , nerve invasion , vessel invasion or serum CA19-9 level ( P>0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS The down-regulated expression of miR-216a in pancreatic cancer suggests the involvement of miR-216a in the tumorigenesis and development of pancreatic cancer. miR-216a may potentially serve as a novel tumor marker and also a prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer .
Identifying prognostic factors for osteosarcoma ( OS ) aids in the selection of patients who require more aggressive management . CD133 has been found to be a prognostic factor of certain tumor types . However , the association between CD133 expression and the prognosis of OS remains unknown . In this study , we analyzed the association of CD133 expression in OS with clinical factors and overall survival , and further investigated its potential role in metastasis in vitro . We found CD133 expression in 65.7% ( 46/70 ) of OS samples using immunohistochemistry , and it was positively correlated with lung metastasis analyzed by Chi-square test ( P=0.002 ) and shorter overall survival time using the Kaplan-Meier method compared by log-rank test ( P=0.000 ) . Multivariate analysis showed that CD133 expression was an independent prognostic factor of patients with OS . To test for direct participation of CD133 , we separated CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells in the MG63 cell line using magnetic-activated cell sorting and found that CD133(+) cells were more active in migration by scratch wound-healing assay and invasion by Matrigel invasion assay compared with CD133(-) cells . Elevated mRNA expression of the stemness gene octamer-binding transcription factor 4 ( Oct-4 ) and NANOG , and the metastasis-related receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 ( CXCR4 ) were also found in CD133(+) cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction . Thus , expression of CD133 was correlated with lung metastasis and poor prognosis in OS patients . CD133(+) cells may be a type of cancer stem cell with high expression of self-renewal capacity and metastasis-related genes .
That a knock-in mouse harboring a dominant-negative thyroid hormone receptor ( TR)-beta ( Thrb ) mutation develops metastatic thyroid cancer strongly suggests the involvement of TRbeta in carcinogenesis . Epigenetic silencing of the THRB gene is common in human cancers . The aim of the present study was to determine how DNA methylation affected the expression of the THRB gene in differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) and how reexpression of the THRB gene attenuated the cancer phenotypes . We used methylation-specific PCR to examine the expression and promoter methylation of the THRB gene in DTC tissues . Thyroid cancer cells with hypermethylated THRB were treated with the demethylating agents 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5'-aza-CdR ) and zebularine to evaluate their impact on the cancer cell phenotypes . THRB mRNA expression in DTC was 90% lower than in normal controls , and this decrease was associated with a higher tumor/lymph node staging . The promoter methylation level of the THRB gene had a significant negative correlation with the expression level of the THRB gene . Treatment of FTC-236 cells with 5'-aza-CdR or zebularine induced reexpression of the THRB gene and inhibited cell proliferation and migration . FTC-236 cells stably expressing TRbeta exhibited lower cell proliferation and migration through inhibition of beta-catenin signaling pathways compared with FTC-236 without TRbeta. 5'-Aza-CdR also led to suppression of tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model using FTC-236 cells consistent with the cell-based studies . These finding indicate that TRbeta is a tumor suppressor and could be tested as a potential therapeutic target .
We have already shown that IL-10 plays an important role in immunosuppression and metastatic dissemination in the rat B-cell lymphoma L-TACB model . It was suggested that the up-regulation of IL-10 production and IL-10 receptor ( IL-10R ) expression would be part of the transition from primary tumor to metastatic phenotype and that IL-10 , besides its immunosuppressive activity , may act as a growth factor for metastatic L-TACB cells . The treatment of L-TACB-bearing rats with a single low-dose cyclophosphamide decreased IL-10 production , reverted immunosuppression and induced the immunologic rejection of tumor metastasis without any effect on primary tumor growth . Our current aim was to investigate the effects of cyclophosphamide on the expression of IL-10 and IL-10R on primary and metastatic L-TACB cells . Considering that cyclophosphamide is a prodrug , we used mafosfamide , a compound that yields in vitro the same active metabolites as cyclophosphamide does in vivo . Mafosfamide induced down-regulation of IL-10 production and IL-10R expression on metastatic cells and , concomitantly , inhibited metastatic cell proliferation . We suggest that mafosfamide would inhibit the regulatory loop mediated by the IL-10/IL-10R system and , as a consequence , metastatic cell proliferation . These results may have a considerable impact on the design of new therapies for metastatic lymphomas .
Approximately 50% of melanomas require oncogenic B-RAF(V600E) signaling for proliferation , survival , and metastasis , and the use of highly selective B-RAF inhibitors has yielded remarkable , although short-term , clinical responses . Reactivation of signaling downstream of B-RAF is frequently associated with acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibitors , and the identification of B-RAF targets may therefore provide new strategies for managing melanoma . In this report , we applied whole-genome expression analyses to reveal that oncogenic B-RAF(V600E) regulates genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in normal cutaneous human melanocytes . Most prominent was the B-RAF-mediated transcriptional repression of E-cadherin , a keratinocyte-melanoma adhesion molecule whose loss is intimately associated with melanoma invasion and metastasis . Here we identify a link between oncogenic B-RAF , the transcriptional repressor Tbx3 , and E-cadherin . We show that B-RAF(V600E) induces the expression of Tbx3 , which potently represses E-cadherin expression in melanocytes and melanoma cells . Tbx3 expression is normally restricted to developmental embryonic tissues and promoting cell motility , but it is also aberrantly increased in various cancers and has been linked to tumor cell invasion and metastasis . We propose that this B-RAF/Tbx3/E-cadherin pathway has a critical role in promoting the metastasis of B-RAF-mutant melanomas .
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are considered to be regulators of various biological processes in cancers , including the epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , which is a key factor in cancer metastasis . In this study , we aimed to clarify the potential roles of miR-490-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells . Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR , we discovered that miR-490-3p was up-regulated in HCC tissues and cells compared with the adjacent non-tumor tissues and normal cells . We also found that overexpression of miR-490-3p led to an increase in cell proliferation , migration , and invasion abilities and that it contributed to EMT . The inhibition of miR-490-3p had the opposite effect on the cells . We identified ERGIC3 ( endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment protein 3 ) as a direct target gene for miR-490-3p . Unlike most miRNA-mRNA interactions , miR-490-3p increased ERGIC3 mRNA and protein levels as well as the intensity of expression of the EGFP reporter gene controlled by the 3'-UTR of ERGIC3 mRNA . The up-regulation by miR-490-3p also required the participation of Ago2 . The inhibition of miR-490-3p reduced the expression of ERGIC3 . Overexpression of ERGIC3 led to the same effect on HCC cells as miR-490-3p overexpression , including EMT . Importantly , silencing ERGIC3 reversed the cellular responses mediated by miR-490-3p overexpression . In conclusion , our study indicated for the first time that miR-490-3p functioned like an oncogenic miRNA in HCC cells and that the inhibition of miR-490-3p might provide an potential treatment approach for HCC patients .
The flow of interstitial fluid and the associated interstitial fluid pressure ( IFP ) in solid tumors and surrounding host tissues have been identified as critical elements in cancer growth and vascularization . Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that tumors may present elevated IFP , which can be a formidable physical barrier for delivery of cell nutrients and small molecules into the tumor . Elevated IFP may also exacerbate gradients of biochemical signals such as angiogenic factors released by tumors into the surrounding tissues . These studies have helped to understand both biochemical signaling and treatment prognosis . Building upon previous work , here we develop a vascular tumor growth model by coupling a continuous growth model with a discrete angiogenesis model . We include fluid/oxygen extravasation as well as a continuous lymphatic field , and study the micro-environmental fluid dynamics and their effect on tumor growth by accounting for blood flow , transcapillary fluid flux , interstitial fluid flow , and lymphatic drainage . We thus elucidate further the non-trivial relationship between the key elements contributing to the effects of interstitial pressure in solid tumors . In particular , we study the effect of IFP on oxygen extravasation and show that small blood/lymphatic vessel resistance and collapse may contribute to lower transcapillary fluid/oxygen flux , thus decreasing the rate of tumor growth . We also investigate the effect of tumor vascular pathologies , including elevated vascular and interstitial hydraulic conductivities inside the tumor as well as diminished osmotic pressure differences , on the fluid flow across the tumor capillary bed , the lymphatic drainage , and the IFP . Our results reveal that elevated interstitial hydraulic conductivity together with poor lymphatic function is the root cause of the development of plateau profiles of the IFP in the tumor , which have been observed in experiments , and contributes to a more uniform distribution of oxygen , solid tumor pressure and a broad-based collapse of the tumor lymphatics . We also find that the rate that IFF is fluxed into the lymphatics and host tissue is largely controlled by an elevated vascular hydraulic conductivity in the tumor . We discuss the implications of these results on microenvironmental transport barriers , and the tumor invasive and metastatic potential . Our results suggest the possibility of developing strategies of targeting tumor cells based on the cues in the interstitial fluid .
Metastasis , commonly to the lung , is the major cause of mortality from testicular cancer . The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a novel nutrient mixture ( NM ) containing ascorbic acid , amino acids and green tea extract on the inhibition of melanoma growth and metastasis using a model of intratesticular inoculation of B16FO cells into nude mice . Male athymic mice ( n=12 ) , 10-12 weeks of age , were inoculated with 5<FFFD>10(5) B16FO melanoma cells in 100 mul of PBS into the right testis , while the left testis was left untreated . Following inoculation , the mice were randomly divided into two groups . The control group ( n=6 ) was fed a regular mouse chow diet and the NM 1% group ( n=6 ) the same diet , but supplemented with 1% NM . Four weeks later the mice were sacrificed and the abdominal cavity was opened . Mice in the control group exhibited extensive metastasis in the peritoneal cavity and severely enlarged right testes and necrotic seminiferous tubules . By contrast , in the NM 1% fed group there was no evidence of peritoneal metastasis in 50% of the animals and mild metastasis in the remaining 50% . The right testes were enlarged and seminiferous tubules in the area of invasion showed evidence of degeneration . No metastasis to the liver , kidney or spleen were evident in either group . However , severe lung metastasis was observed in 2 of 6 mice in the control group and mild metastasis in 2 of 6 mice in the NM 1% group . In conclusion , these results confirm earlier studies and verify the anti-metastatic potential of NM .
The prediction of tumor behavior for patients with oral carcinomas remains a challenge for clinicians . The presence of lymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor but it is limited in predicting local relapse or survival . This highlights the need for identifying biomarkers that may effectively contribute to prediction of recurrence and tumor spread . In this study , we used one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis , mass spectrometry and immunodetection methods to analyze protein expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas . Using a refinement for classifying oral carcinomas in regard to prognosis , we analyzed small but lymph node metastasis-positive versus large , lymph node metastasis-negative tumors in order to contribute to the molecular characterization of subgroups with risk of dissemination . Specific protein patterns favoring metastasis were observed in the " more-aggressive " group defined by the present study . This group displayed upregulation of proteins involved in migration , adhesion , angiogenesis , cell cycle regulation , anti-apoptosis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition , whereas the " less-aggressive " group was engaged in keratinocyte differentiation , epidermis development , inflammation and immune response . Besides the identification of several proteins not yet described as deregulated in oral carcinomas , the present study demonstrated for the first time the role of cofilin-1 in modulating cell invasion in oral carcinomas .
Liver resection is now widely accepted as a potentially curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis . However , the efficacy of surgical resection for gastric cancer liver metastasis(GLM)remains unclear . Based on our 18-year experience with 64 patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for GLM , we discuss the indication and efficacy of surgical resection for GLM . From January 1993 to January 2011 , 73 patients underwent hepatectomy for GLM in the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery , Cancer Institute Ariake Hospital(Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research ) , Japan . The actuarial1 - , 3- , and 5-year overall survival rates and 1- , 3- , and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates of those 64 patients who achieved curative resections were 84 , 50 , and 37% , and 42 , 27 , and 27% , respectively . By multivariate analysis , serosal invasion of the primary gastric cancer and larger hepatic tumor(>5 cm in diameter)were found to be independent indicators of poor prognosis . Based on the multivariate analysis results , all patients were divided into three groups no poor prognostic factor(n=38) , one poor prognostic factor(n=24) , and two poor prognostic factors(n=2) . The actuarial overall survival rates of each group were 63 , 36 , and 0% at 3 years , and 53 , 15 , and 0% at 5 years . GLM patients having hepatic tumors with the maximum diameter of <5 cm , and without serosalinvasion of the primary gastric cancer , are the best candidates for hepatectomy .
Nuuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) are major transcription factors that have been associated with breast cancer metastasis by inducing matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) expression . In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effects of guggulsterone isomers ( cis or trans ) on 12-O-tetradecanoylpho-bol-13-acetate ( TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression . Cis-guggulsterone inhibited TPA-induced MMP expression by blocking IkappaB kinase ( IKK)/NF-kappaB signaling , whereas trans-guggulsterone blocked mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK)/AP-1 signaling . Cis-guggulsterone was more potent than trans-guggulsterone in the inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and invasion of MCF-7 cells . Furthermore , we found that the combination of these isomers exerted an additive effect on the inhibition of MCF-7 cell invasion . These results suggest that guggulsterone isomers downregulate MMP-9 expression and tumor cell invasion through the isomer-specific suppression of IKK/NF-kappaB and MAPK/AP-1 activation . In addition , the suppression of MMP-9 expression correlated well with the inhibition of cell invasion .
ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : Chemokine receptor CXCR4 , together with its ligand CXCL12 , plays critical roles in cancer progression , including growth , metastasis and angiogenesis . Ewing sarcoma is a sarcoma with poor prognosis despite current therapies , particularly for patients with advanced-stage disease . Lungs and bone ( marrow ) , organs of predilection for ( primary/metastatic ) Ewing sarcoma , represent predominant CXCL12 sources . METHODS : To gain insight into the role of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in Ewing sarcoma , CXCR4 , CXCL12 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha protein expression was studied in therapy-naive and metastatic tumors by immunohistochemistry . CXCR4 function was assessed in vitro , by flow cytometry and proliferation/ cell viability assays , in the presence of recombinant CXCL12 and/or CXCR4-antagonist AMD3100 or under hypoxic conditions . RESULTS : Whereas CXCR4 was predominantly expressed by tumor cells , CXCL12 was observed in both tumor and stromal areas . Survival analysis revealed an ( expression level-dependent ) negative impact of CXCR4 expression ( p < 0.04 ) . A role for the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in Ewing sarcoma growth was suggested by our observations that i ) CXCR4 expression correlated positively with tumor volume at diagnosis ( p = 0.013 ) , ii ) CXCL12 was present within the microenvironment of virtually all cases , iii ) CXCL12 induced proliferation of CXCR4-positive Ewing sarcoma cell lines , which could be abrogated by AMD3100 . CXCR4 expression was not correlated with occurrence of metastatic disease . Also , therapy-naive tumors demonstrated higher CXCR4 expression as compared to metastases ( p = 0.027 ) . Evaluation of in vivo hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression and culture of cells under hypoxic conditions revealed no role for hypoxia in CXCR4 expression . CONCLUSIONS : Together , our results imply a crucial role for the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in auto- and/or paracrine growth stimulation . Integration of CXCR4-targeting strategies into first- and/or second-line treatment regimens may represent a promising treatment option for Ewing sarcoma .
The aim of the present work was to study the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , mediated by bFGF signaling and its possible crosstalk with prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) in LNCaP and PC3-PSMA prostate cancer cell lines . PC3 cells stably transfected with PSMA gene were used for restoring PSMA expression . LNCaP and PC3-PSMA cells were exposed to 10ng/mL of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) . IL-6 production was measured by ELISA assay , and levels of PSMA expression were assessed by flow cytometry . AKT , ERK1/2 , and p38 phosphorylation were detected by Western blot. bFGF enhances IL-6 production in LNCaP and PC3-PSMA prostate cancer cells . The effect of bFGF on stimulating IL-6 secretion was greater in LNCaP than in PC3-PSMA cells . In the presence of bFGF , PSMA expression was activated after 4days of treatment in LNCaP and PC3-PSMA cells . This activation was not maintained after long term of treatment in both metastatic cell lines . Solely MAPKs pathways ( ERK1/2 and p38 ) were activated after bFGF stimulation in both metastatic cell lines , whereas AKT did not show any activation . The interference of the proinflammatory cytokine , IL-6 , with bFGF signaling and PSMA , should be of high clinical relevance in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer . In developing novel therapeutic modalities targeting IL-6 , significant attention should be given to PSMA and its inactivation to fight against prostate cancer .
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs or miR ) have been integrated into tumorigenic programs as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes . The miR-124 was reported to be attenuated in several tumors , such as glioma , medulloblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma . However , its role in cancer remains greatly elusive . In this study , we show that the miR-124 expression is significantly suppressed in human breast cancer specimens , which is reversely correlated to histological grade of the cancer . More intriguingly , ectopic expression of miR-124 in aggressive breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 strongly inhibits cell motility and invasive capacity , as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process . Also , lentivirus-delivered miR-124 endows MDA-MB-231 cells with the ability to suppress cell colony formation in vitro and pulmonary metastasis in vivo . Further studies have identified the E-cadherin transcription repressor Slug as a direct target gene of miR-124 ; its downregulation by miR-124 increases the expression of E-cadherin , a hallmark of epithelial cells and a repressor of cell invasion and metastasis . Moreover , knockdown of Slug notably impairs the motility of MDA-MB-231 cells , whereas re-expression of Slug abrogates the reduction of motility and invasion ability induced by miR-124 in MDA-MB-231 cells . These findings highlight an important role for miR-124 in the regulation of invasive and metastatic potential of breast cancer and suggest a potential application of miR-124 in cancer treatment .
Gliomas display anoikis resistance , enhanced invasion in to the adjacent brain parenchyma and eventually recur despite using the standard therapies . Our studies on increased anoikis sensitization in matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2)-knockdown 4910 and 5310 human glioma xenograft cells were interestingly correlated with p21-activated kinase 4 ( PAK4 ) inhibition , prompting us to further investigate the role of PAK4 in glioma . Here , we report the PAK4 upregulation in positive correlation with increasing glioma pathological grades . The siRNA-mediated PAK4 knockdown elevated anoikis , and inhibited invasion and migration by downregulating MMP-2 , alphavbeta3-integrin and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor ( phospho-EGFR ) . The cDNA-PCR arrays revealed a transcriptional suppression of essential proteins involved in cell proliferation and adhesion in PAK4-knockdown cells . Most importantly , glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated the MMP-2 as a new PAK4-interacting protein which binds to PAK4 kinase domain . Individual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor and alphavbeta3 antibody treatments in PAK4si-treated cells indicated the regulation of alphavbeta3/EGFR survival signaling by PAK4 . Overexpression of PAK4 significantly reversed the MMP2si-induced cell death in both cell lines . Codepletion of PAK4 and MMP-2 resulted in robust anoikis-mediated cell death , and severely inhibited invasive and migratory properties in these cells . PAK4si inhibited in vivo tumor growth in nude mice by inhibiting MMP-2 , beta3-integrin and phospho-EGFR levels in tumors . Our findings indicate a physical association between PAK4 and MMP-2 , and suggest the future therapeutic potential of PAK4/MMP-2 dual targeting in glioma treatment .
High-grade prostate cancers express high levels of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , major enzymes involved in tumor invasion and metastasis . However , the tumor cell lines commonly employed for prostate cancer research express only small amounts of MMPs when cultivated as monolayer cultures , in common culture media . The present study was conducted to ascertain whether culture conditions that include fibronectin can alter MMP2 and MMP9 expression by the human prostatic epithelial cell lines RWPE-1 , LNCaP and PC-3 . These cells were individually seeded at 2x10(4) cells/cm(2) , cultivated until they reached 80% confluence , and then exposed for 4h to fibronectin , after which the conditioned medium was analyzed by gelatin zymography . Untreated cells were given common medium . Only RWPE-1 cells express detectable amounts of MMP9 when cultivated in common medium , whereas the addition of fibronectin induced high expression levels of pro and active forms of MMP2 in all tested cell lines . Our findings demonstrate that normal and tumor prostate cell lines express MMP2 activity when in contact with extracellular matrix components or blood plasma proteins such as fibronectin . Future studies of transcriptomes and proteomes in prostate cancer research using these cell lines should not neglect these important conclusions .
We evaluated the clinical significance of indoleamine 2 , 3-dioxygenase ( IDO ) expression in breast cancer patients with bone metastasis . IDO activity can be measured by the tryptophan(Trp)/kynurenine(Kyn) ratio . Trp and Kyn levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . The serum IDO levels of postoperative breast cancer patients with a high number of bone metastases were lower than those of patients with a single metastasis lesion . In addition , IDO activity increased in the cases in which the number of metastatic lesions to the bone increased . These results suggest that the expression of IDO in breast cancer patients with bone metastasis may play a critical role in immunosuppression in these patients .
We report a case of recurrent gastric cancer successfully treated by a combination of CPT-11 and CDDP as the third- line chemotherapy . A 78-year-old man with advanced gastric cancer underwent a curative distal gastrectomy . Three years later , the tumor marker level began to rise and computed tomography ( CT ) revealed lymph node metastasis invading the pancreas resulting in pancreatic duct dilatation . S-1 treatment was initiated but was discontinued because of a systemic exanthem . Paclitaxel was administrated as secondary chemotherapy . But , after 2 courses , a further increase in the tumor marker level and portal vein invasion were observed . Combination therapy of CPT-11 and CDDP was administered as the third-line chemotherapy . After 3 courses , the tumor marker level normalized , tumor size decreased , and the invasion was eliminated . Third-line chemotherapy against recurrent gastric cancer should be considered if patient performance status ( PS ) is maintained .
Vaccination is , in theory , a safe and effective approach for controlling disseminated or metastatic cancer due to the specificity of the mammalian immune system , yet its success in the clinic has been hampered thus far by the problem of immune tolerance to tumor self-antigen . Here we describe a DNA vaccination strategy that is able to control cancer by overcoming immune tolerance to tumor self-antigen . We engineered a DNA construct encoding a dimeric form of a secreted single chain trimer of major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain , beta2-microglobulin , and peptide antigen linked to immunoglobulin G ( SCT-Ag/IgG ) . The chimeric protein was able to bind to antigen-specific CD8+ T cells with nearly 100% efficiency and strongly induce their activation and proliferation . In addition , the chimeric protein was able to coat professional antigen-presenting cells through the Fc receptor to activate antigen-specific CD8+ T cells . Furthermore , intradermal vaccination with DNA encoding SCT-Ag/IgG could generate significant numbers of cytotoxic effector T cells against tumor self-antigen and leads to successful therapeutic outcomes in a preclinical model of metastatic melanoma . Our data suggest that the DNA vaccine strategy described in the current study is able to break immune tolerance against endogenous antigen and result in potent therapeutic antitumor effects . Such strategy may be used in other antigenic systems for the control of infections and/or cancers .
The role of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-20 ( IL-20 ) has not yet been studied in cancer biology . Here , we demonstrated up-regulation of both IL-20 and IL-20R1 in muscle invasive bladder cancer ( MIBC ) patients . The expressions of IL-20 and IL-20R1 were observed in bladder cancer 5637 and T-24 cells . We found that IL-20 significantly increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-9 via binding activity of NF-kappaB and AP-1 in bladder cancer cells and stimulated the activation of ERK1/2 , JNK , p38MAPK , and Jak-Stat signaling . Among the pathways examined , only ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 significantly inhibited IL-20-induced migration and invasion . Moreover , siRNA knockdown of IL-20R1 suppressed migration , invasion , ERK1/2 activation , and NF-kappaB-mediated MMP-9 expression induced by IL-20 . Unexpectedly , cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1 was induced by IL-20 treatment without altering cell cycle progression . Blockade of p21WAF1 function by siRNA reversed migration , invasion , activation of ERK signaling , MMP-9 expression , and activation of NF-kappaB in IL-20-treated cells . In addition , IL-20 induced the activation of IKK , the degradation and phosphorylation of IkappaBa , and NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation , which was regulated by ERK1/2 . IL-20 stimulated the recruitment of p65 to the MMP-9 promoter region . Finally , the IL-20-induced migration and invasion of cells was confirmed by IL-20 gene transfection and by addition of anti-IL-20 antibody . This is the first report that p21WAF1 is involved in ERK1/2-mediated MMP-9 expression via increased binding activity of NF-kappaB , which resulted in the induction of migration in IL-20/IL-20R1 dyad-induced bladder cancer cells . These unexpected results might provide a critical new target for the treatment of bladder cancer .
Hypoxia is known to play critical roles in cell survival , angiogenesis , tumor invasion , and metastasis . Hypoxia mediated over-expression of hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) has been shown to be associated with therapeutic resistance , and contributes to poor prognosis of cancer patients . Emerging evidence suggest that hypoxia and HIF pathways contributes to the acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , maintenance of cancer stem cell ( CSC ) functions , and also maintains the vicious cycle of inflammation-all which lead to therapeutic resistance . However , the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which hypoxia/HIF drives these events are not fully understood . Here , we show , for the first time , that hypoxia leads to increased expression of VEGF , IL-6 , and CSC signature genes Nanog , Oct4 and EZH2 consistent with increased cell migration/invasion and angiogenesis , and the formation of pancreatospheres , concomitant with increased expression of miR-21 and miR-210 in human pancreatic cancer ( PC ) cells . The treatment of PC cells with CDF , a novel synthetic compound inhibited the production of VEGF and IL-6 , and down-regulated the expression of Nanog , Oct4 , EZH2 mRNAs , as well as miR-21 and miR-210 under hypoxia . CDF also led to decreased cell migration/invasion , angiogenesis , and formation of pancreatospheres under hypoxia . Moreover , CDF decreased gene expression of miR-21 , miR-210 , IL-6 , HIF-1alpha , VEGF , and CSC signatures in vivo in a mouse orthotopic model of human PC . Collectively , these results suggest that the anti-tumor activity of CDF is in part mediated through deregulation of tumor hypoxic pathways , and thus CDF could become a novel , and effective anti-tumor agent for PC therapy .
Loss of p53 is considered to allow progression of colorectal tumors from the adenoma to the carcinoma stage . Using mice with an intestinal epithelial cell ( IEC)-specific p53 deletion , we demonstrate that loss ofp53 alone is insufficient to initiate intestinal tumorigenesis but markedly enhances carcinogen-induced tumor incidence and leads to invasive cancer and lymph node metastasis . Whereas p53 controls DNA damage and IEC survival during the initiation stage , loss of p53 during tumor progression is associated with increased intestinal permeability , causing formation of an NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory microenvironment and the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition . Thus , we propose a p53-controlled tumor-suppressive function that is independent of its well-established role in cell-cycle regulation , apoptosis , and senescence .
Nitric oxide ( NO)-releasing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NO-NSAIDs ) which have been synthesized to reduce gastro-intestinal and cardiovascular toxicities of NSAIDs , possess anti-proliferative , pro-apoptotic and anti-cancer activities . Here , we show that NO-sulindac inhibited UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis in SKH-1 hairless mice . Topical application of NO-sulindac reduced tumor incidence , number ( p<0.05 ) and volume ( p<0.005 ) as compared to UVB ( alone)-irradiated vehicle-treated mice . An increase in TUNEL-positive cells in skin lesions was accompanied by the enhanced Bax:Bcl-2 ratio . The expression of pro-apoptotic Bax was increased whereas anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 reduced . However , proliferation was identified as the major target of NO-sulindac in this study . A reduced expression of PCNA and cyclin D1 associated with the dampening of cell cycle progression was observed . The mechanism of this inhibition was related to the reduction in UVB-induced Notch signaling pathway . UVB-induced inflammatory responses were diminished by NO-sulindac as observed by a remarkable reduction in the levels of phosphorylated MAP Kinases Erk1/2 , p38 and JNK1/2 . In this regard , NO-sulindac also inhibited NFkappaB by enhancing IkappaBalpha as evidenced by the reduced expression of iNOS and COX-2 , the direct NFkappaB transcription target proteins . NO-sulindac significantly diminished the progression of benign lesions to invasive carcinomas by suppressing the tumor aggressiveness and retarding epithelial-mesenchymal transition . A marked decrease in the expression of mesenchymal markers such as Fibronectin , N-cadherin , SNAI , Slug and Twist and an increase in epithelial cell polarity marker E-cadherin were noted in NO-sulindac-treated tumors . Our data suggest that NO-sulindac is a potent inhibitor of UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis and acts by targeting proliferation-regulatory pathways .
Splenic haemangiosarcomas ( HSAs ) from 122 dogs were characterized and classified according to their patterns of growth , survival time post splenectomy , metastases and chemotherapy . The most common pattern of growth was a mixture of cavernous , capillary and solid tumour tissue . Survival time post splenectomy was independent of the growth pattern ; however , it was influenced by chemotherapy and metastases . Immunohistochemical assessment of the expression of angiogenic factors ( fetal liver kinase-1 , angiopoietin-2 , angiopoietin receptor-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor A ) and conventional endothelial markers ( CD31 , factor VIII-related antigen ) revealed variable expression , particularly in undifferentiated HSAs . Therefore , a combination of endothelial markers should be used to confirm the endothelial origin of splenic tumours .
Bladder cancer ( BCa ) remained a major health problem . Med19 was related to tumor growth of BCa . Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) were reported to be critical in bone metastasis of cancer . We therefore investigated the relations between Med19 and BMPs in BCa and their effect on bone metastasis of BCa . Bladder cancer cell lines were cultured and interfered with Med19 shRNA and control . Expressions of BMP-1 , BMP-2 , BMP-4 , BMP-5 , BMP-6 , BMP-7 , BMP-9 , and BMP-15 were studied between 2 groups . Fifty-two BCa samples were included for immunohistochemical staining of Med19 and BMP-2 . Expressions were scored and studied statistically . Invasiveness was studied with Transwell assay . Silencing or Med19 in BCa cells induced altered expressions of BMPs . Increased expressions of BMP-1 , BMP-4 , BMP-6 , BMP-7 , and BMP-15 and decreased expressions of BMP-2 , BMP-5 , and BMP-9 were noticed , but only BMP-2 reached statistical significance . Expressions of Med19 and BMP-2 were significantly higher in cases with bone metastasis and were positively correlated in cases with bone metastasis and muscle invasion . Med19 is a critical factor involved in the invasiveness and promotion of bone metastasis of BCa , possibly via BMP-2 .
BACKGROUND O(6) -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) is a DNA repair enzyme that can protect cells from carcinogenic effects of alkylating agents by removing adducts from the O(6) position of guanine . Evidences indicated that areca quid chewing may increase the risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) . This study was to investigate the role of MGMT expression in OSCCs and the normal oral tissues . METHODS Thirty-two OSCCs from areca quid chewers and ten normal oral tissue biopsy samples without areca quid chewing were analyzed by the immunohistochemistry for MGMT . Primary human oral keratinocytes ( HOKs ) were challenged with arecoline , the major alkaloid of areca nut , by Western blot . Nicotine , an important component of cigarette smoke , was added to find the possible regulatory mechanisms . RESULTS Significant association was observed between low MGMT expression and advanced clinical stage of OSCCs and lymph node metastasis ( P=0.03 ) . MGMT expression was significantly higher in patients only chewing areca quid than patients both chewing areca quid and smoking ( P=0.028 ) . Arecoline was found to elevate MGMT expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner . The addition of nicotine was found to enhance arecoline-induced MGMT expression . CONCLUSION Our results indicate that MGMT could be used clinically as a predictive marker for tumor processing , the potential for lymph node metastasis as well as advanced clinical stage . MGMT expression was significantly upregulated by arecoline in HOKs . Nicotine has a synergistic effect of arecoline-induced MGMT expression . The cigarette smoking may act synergistically in the pathogenesis of OSCC in areca quid chewers via the upregulation of MGMT .
CDA-2 ( cell differentiation agent 2 ) , a urinary preparation , has potent anti- proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties in cancer cells . However , the mechanisms of tumor inhibitory action of CDA-2 are far from clear , and especially there was no report on lung cancer . Here we demonstrate that CDA-2 and its main component phenylacetylglutamine ( PG ) reduce the metastatic lung tumor growth , and increases survival time after inoculation with Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) cells in a dose-dependent manner in C57BL6 mice . Proliferative program analysis in cancer cells revealed a fundamental impact of CDA-2 and PG on proliferation and apoptosis , including Bcl-2 , Bcl-XL , cIAP1 , Survivin , PCNA , Ki-67 proteins and TUNEL assays . CDA-2 and PG significantly reduced NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in lung cancer cells and in alveolar macrophages of tumor bearing mice and especially decreased the release of inflammatory factors including TNFalpha , IL-6 , and KC . Furthermore , CDA-2 and PG decrease the expressions of TLR2 , TLR6 , and CD14 , but not TLR1 , TLR3 , TLR4 , and TLR9 in bone-marrow-derived macrophages ( BMDM ) of mice stimulated by LLC-conditioned medium ( LLC-CM ) . Over-expressing TLR2 in BMDM prevented CDA-2 and PG from inhibiting NF-kappaB activation , as well as induction of TNFalpha and IL-6 . TLR2:TLR6 complexes mediate the effect of NF-kappaB inactivation by CDA-2 . In conclusion , CDA-2 potently inhibits lung tumor development by reduction of the inflammation in lung through suppression of NF-kappaB activation in myeloid cells , associating with modulation of TLR2 signaling .
Filamin-A cross-links actin filaments into dynamic orthogonal networks , and interacts with an array of proteins of diverse cellular functions . Because several filamin-A interaction partners are implicated in signaling of cell mobility regulation , we tested the hypothesis that filamin-A plays a role in cancer metastasis . Using four pairs of filamin-A proficient and deficient isogenic cell lines , we found that filamin-A deficiency in cancer cells significantly reduces their migration and invasion . Using a xenograft tumor model with subcutaneous and intracardiac injections of tumor cells , we found that the filamin-A deficiency causes significant reduction of lung , splenic and systemic metastasis in nude mice . We evaluated the expression of filamin-A in breast cancer tissues by immunohistochemical staining , and found that low levels of filamin-A expression in cancer cells of the tumor tissues are associated with a better distant metastasis-free survival than those with normal levels of filamin-A . These data not only validate filamin-A as a prognostic marker for cancer metastasis , but also suggest that inhibition of filamin-A in cancer cells may reduce metastasis and that filamin-A can be used as a therapeutic target for filamin-A positive cancer .
Cell invasion is required for neoplastic metastasis . Matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , which degrades the extracellular matrix , is a major component in the process of cancer cell invasion . Sulfuretin is one of the major flavonoids isolated from Rhus verniciflua . Sulfuretin has been used to reduce oxidative stress , platelet aggregation , the inflammatory response and mutagenesis . However , the effect of sulfuretin on breast cancer metastasis is unknown . In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effect of sulfuretin on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion in MCF-7 cells . Sulfuretin inhibited TPA-induced transcriptional activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB ( NF-\u03baB ) . We demonstrated that sulfuretin mediated the inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and that cell invasion in MCF-7 cells involved suppression of the NF-\u03baB pathway . Therefore , inhibiting MMP-9 expression by sulfuretin may have therapeutic potential for controlling breast cancer invasiveness .
We had demonstrated that plasminogen kringle 5 ( K5 ) , a potent angiogenic inhibitor , inhibited retinal neovascularization and hepatocellular carcinoma growth by anti-angiogenesis . The current study investigated the effects and the underlying mechanisms of K5 on both tumor growth and spontaneous pulmonary metastasis in Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) implanted mouse model . Similarly , K5 could decrease expression of VEGF in LLC cells and grafted tissues and suppress tumor angiogenesis and growth . K5 had no direct effect on proliferation and apoptosis of LLC . However , K5 could significantly inhibit SDF-1alpha-induced chemotaxis movement of LLC cells and resulted in a great reduction of surface metastatic nodules and micrometastases in the lungs of LLC tumor-bearing mice . K5 also decreased expression of chemokine ( C-X-C motif ) receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) in LLC cells and grafted tissues . Furthermore , K5 down-regulated SDF-1alpha expression in metastatic lung tissues of LLC-bearing mice . Therefore , K5 may suppress tumor pulmonary metastasis through inhibiting SDF-1alpha-CXCR4 chemotaxis movement and down-regulation of VEGF . Moreover , the role of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha ( HIF-1alpha ) , a crucial transcriptional factor for both VEGF and CXCR4 expression , was evaluated . The siRNA of HIF-1alpha attenuated expression of VEGF and CXCR4 and inhibited LLC migration . K5 decreased HIF-1alpha protein level and impaired nuclear HIF-1alpha accumulation . These results showed for the first time that K5 inhibits LLC growth and metastasis via the dual effects of anti-angiogenesis and suppression of tumor cell motility by targeting the pivotal molecule , HIF-1alpha .
OBJECTIVE The aim of this retrospective study is to analyze the clinical and pathological factors related to the prognosis of Chinese patients with stage Ib to IIb cervical cancer . METHODS AND RESULTS 13 clinical pathological factors in 255 patients with stage Ib to IIb cervical cancer undergoing radical hysterectomy and systematic lymphadenectomy were analyzed to screen for factors related to prognosis . The cumulative 5-year survival of the 255 patients was 75.7% . The result of the univariate analysis suggested that clinical stage , cell differentiation , depth of cervical stromal invasion , parametrial tissue involvement , and lymph node metastasis were prognostic factors for patients with stage Ib to IIb cervical cancer ( P<0.05 ) . Compared with cases with involvement of iliac nodes , obturator nodes , or inguinal lymph nodes , cases with metastasis to the common iliac lymph nodes had a poorer prognosis ( P<0.05 ) . Cases with involvement of four or more lymph nodes had a poorer prognosis than those with involvement of three or fewer lymph nodes ( P<0.05 ) . Using multivariate Cox proportional hazards model regression analysis , non-squamous histological type , poor differentiation , parametrial tissue involvement , and outer 1/3 stromal invasion were found to be independently related to patients poor prognosis ( P<0.05 ) . CONCLUSION Non-squamous histological type , poor cell differentiation , parametrial tissue involvement , and outer 1/3 stromal invasion are the independent poor prognostic factors for patients with stage Ib to IIb cervical cancer .
Family with sequence similarity 189 , member B ( FAM189B ) , alias COTE1 , a putative oncogene selected by microarray , for the first time was here found to be significantly up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) specimens and HCC cell lines. mRNA expression of COTE1 in HCC samples and cell lines was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and real-time PCR , while protein expression of COTE1 in HCC tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry . In addition , invasion of HCC cells was observed after overexpressing or silencing COTE1 . In the total of 48 paired HCC specimens , compared with the adjacent non-cancer tissues , the expression of COTE1 was up-regulated in 31 ( p<0.01 ) . In HCC cell lines , COTE1 expression was significantly higher than in normal human adult liver ( p<0.01 ) . Overexpression of COTE1 enhanced HCC-derived LM6 and MHCC-L cellular invasion in vitro . In contrast , COTE1 knockdown via RNAi markedly suppressed these phenotypes , as documented in LM3 and MHCC-H HCC cells . Mechanistic analyses indicated that COTE1 could physically associate with WW domain oxidoreductase ( WWOX ) , a tumor suppressor . COTE1 may be closely correlated with invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells and thus may serve as an effective target for gene therapy .
Momordica charantia has been found to exhibit anticancer activity , in addition to its well-known therapeutic functions . We have demonstrated that the leaf extract of Momordica charantia ( MCME ) induces apoptosis in several human cancer cells through caspase- and mitochondria-dependent pathways . In this study , a different susceptibility to MCME was found in human lung adenocarcinoma CL1 cells with different metastatic ability , leading to the significant difference of cell viability and invasiveness between MCME-treated CL1-0 and CL1-5 cells . MCME was found to upregulate the expression of Wnt-2 and affect the migratory and invasive ability of CL1 cells through suppressed MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzymatic activities . We proposed that MCME mediates inhibition against migration of CL1 cells by reducing the expression and activation of Src and FAK to decrease the expression of downstream Akt , beta-catenin , and MMPs .
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a critical process providing tumor cells with the ability to migrate and escape from the primary tumor and metastasize to distant sites . Recently , EMT was shown to be associated with the cancer stem cell ( CSC ) phenotype in breast cancer . Snail is a transcription factor that mediates EMT in a number of tumor types , including colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . Our study was done to determine the role of Snail in mediating EMT and CSC function in CRC . Human CRC specimens were stained for Snail expression , and human CRC cell lines were transduced with a retroviral Snail construct or vector control . Cell proliferation and chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin of the infected cells were determined by the MTT ( colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ) assay . Migration and invasion were determined in vitro using modified Boyden chamber assays . EMT and putative CSC markers were analyzed using Western blotting . Intravenous injection of tumor cells was done to evaluate their metastatic potential in mice . Snail was overexpressed in human CRC surgical specimens . This overexpression induced EMT and a CSC-like phenotype in human CRC cells and enhanced cell migration and invasion ( P < 0.002 vs. control ) . Snail overexpression also led to an increase in metastasis formation in vivo ( P < 0.002 vs. control ) . Furthermore , the Snail-overexpressing CRC cells were more chemoresistant to oxaliplatin than control cells . Increased Snail expression induces EMT and the CSC-like phenotype in CRC cells , which enhance cancer cell invasion and chemoresistance . Thus , Snail is a potential therapeutic target in metastatic CRC .
Cellular redox changes have emerged as a pivotal and proximal event in cancer . PKI 166 is used to determine the effects of redox sensitive inhibition of EGFR , metastasis and apoptosis in epidermoid carcinoma . Cytotoxicity study of PKI 166 ( IC50 1.0 microM ) treated A431 cells were performed by MTT assay for 48 and 72 hrs . Morphological analysis of PKI 166 treated A431 cells for 48 hrs. revealed the cell shrinkage , loss of filopodia and lamellipodia by phase contrast and SEM images in dose dependent manner . It has cytotoxic effects through inhibiting cellular proliferation , leads to the induction of apoptosis , as increased fraction of sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle , chromatin condensation and DNA ladder . It inhibited cyclin-D1 and cyclin-E expression and induced p53 , p21 expression in dose dependent manner . Consequently , an imbalance of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio triggered caspase cascade and subsequent cleavage of PARP , thereby shifting the balance in favour of apoptosis . PKI 166 treatment actively stimulated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and mitochondrial membrane depolarization . It inhibited some metastatic properties of A431 cells supressing colony formation by soft agar assay and inhibition of MMP 9 activity by gelatin zymography and western blot analysis . PKI 166 inhibited growth factor induced phosphorylation of EGFR , Akt , MAPK , JNK and colony formation in A431 cells . Thus the inhibition of proliferation was associated with redox regulation of the caspase cascade , EGFR , Akt/PI3K , MAPK/ ERK and JNK pathway . On the other hand , increased antioxidant activity leads to decreased ROS generation inhibit the anti-proliferative and apoptotic properties of PKI 166 in A431 cells . These observations indicated PKI 166 induced redox signalling dependent inhibition of cell proliferation , metastatic properties and induction of apoptotic potential in epidermoid carcinoma .
OBJECTIVE To observe the anti-tumor recurrent and metastatic efficacy of Ru'ai Shuhou Recipe ( RSR ) on HER2 positive breast cancer , to evaluate the effects of RSR on the expressions of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) in the recurrence and metastasis of HER2 positive breast cancer , thus revealing its anti-tumor recurrent and metastatic mechanisms . METHODS Selected were 30-week-old HER2/neu transgenic spontaneous breast cancer mice FVB/neu . The primary tumor resection was carried out . After surgery they were randomly divided into the blank control group , the RSR group , the Herceptin group , and the combination group ( RSR + Herceptin group ) . The treatment lasted for 4 months . The inhibition rate of the recurrent tumor volume and the inhibition rate of the lung metastasis were evaluated . The expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2 ) , matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase ( TIMP-1 ) , and TIMP-2 in the recurrent tumor tissue were detected using Western blot . RESULTS By the end of the treatment the average recurrent tumor volume was 11.11 +/- 8.71 cm3 in the blank control group and 5.56 +/- 5.55 cm3 of the RSR group , showing statistical difference between the two groups ( P = 0.037 ) . The average lung metastatic nodule was 16 in the blank control group and 10 in the RSR group . The inhibition rate of lung metastasis was 37. 85% in the RSR group , but with no statistical significance . The expression level of activated MMP-2 in the RSR group was down-regulated when compared with the blank control group , the Herceptin group , and the combination group ( P < 0.05 ) . The expression of MMP-9 of the RSR group , the Herceptin group , and the combination group was significantly down-regulated when compared with the blank control group ( P < 0.05 ) . The expression of MMP-9 of the RSR group and the combination group was further down-regulated when compared with the Herceptin group ( P < 0.05 ) . The expressions of both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 of the RSR group , the Herceptin group , and the combination group were all up-regulated when compared with the blank control group ( P < 0.05 ) . The increased expression of TIMP-1 was more significantly in the RSR group and the combination group when compared with the Herceptin group ( P < 0.05 ) . It was higher in the combination group than in the RSR group ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS RSR could inhibit the tumor recurrence of FVB/neu mice . It could reduce the degradation of extracellular matrix and increase the protective effects of extracellular matrix . It might achieve its anti-tumor effect through effecting the invasive and metastatic capabilities of breast tumor cells .
Transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) signaling has been implicated in driving tumor progression and metastasis by inducing stem cell-like features in some human cancer cell lines . In this study , we have utilized a novel murine cell line NMuMG-ST , which acquired cancer stem cell ( CSC ) phenotypes during spontaneous transformation of the untransformed murine mammary cell line NMuMG , to investigate the role of autocrine TGF-beta signaling in regulating their survival , metastatic ability , and the maintenance of cancer stem cell characteristics . We have retrovirally transduced a dominant-negative TGF-beta type II receptor ( DNRII ) into the NMuMG-ST cell to abrogate autocrine TGF-beta signaling . The expression of DNRII reduced TGF-beta sensitivity of the NMuMG-ST cells in various cell-based assays . The blockade of autocrine TGF-beta signaling reduced the ability of the cell to grow anchorage-independently and to resist serum deprivation-induced apoptosis . These phenotypes were associated with reduced levels of active and phosphorylated AKT and ERK , and Gli1 expression suggesting that these pathways contribute to the growth and survival of this model system . More interestingly , the abrogation of autocrine TGF-beta signaling also led to the attenuation of several features associated with mammary stem cells including epithelial-mesenchymal transition , mammosphere formation , and expression of stem cell markers . When xenografted in athymic nude mice , the DNRII cells were also found to undergo apoptosis and induced significantly lower lung metastasis burden than the control cells even though they formed similar size of xenograft tumors . Thus , our results indicate that autocrine TGF-beta signaling is involved in the maintenance and survival of stem-like cell population resulting in the enhanced metastatic ability of the murine breast cancer cells .
Cell migration plays important roles in natural processes involving embryonic development , inflammation , wound healing , cancer metastasis and angiogenesis . Cell migration on various biomaterials is also believed to improve the rate of wound healing and implant therapies in the tissue-engineering field . This study measured the distance traversed , or mileage , of mouse fibroblasts on a silk fibroin surface . Fibroblasts on the fibroin surface moved with better progress during 24 h than cells on collagen or fibronectin surfaces . Results obtained by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) revealed that fibroblasts on the fibroin surface expressed transforming growth factor \u03b2-induced protein ( TGFBI ) , which is an extracellular matrix ( ECM ) protein , stronger than on other surfaces in the early cell-culture stages . These results demonstrate that the fibroin surface shows higher potential to enhance cell migration and the production of ECM than a collagen or fibronectin surface .
BACKGROUND Matrix metalloproteinases comprise a family of enzyme degrade components of extra cellular matrix . There are single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter regions of several genes with ability to influence cancer susceptibility . The aim of this study was to analyze association between MMP3 promoter polymorphisms and colorectal cancer occurrence and progression . MATERIALS AND METHODS In this case-control study 120 colorectal cancer patients and 100 controls were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) on the genomic deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . The patients group was divided into different subgroups : a subgroup without metastatic activity ( M(-) ) and a subgroup that had developed metastasis ( M(+) ) . RESULTS There was a significant difference in frequency of the MMP-3 genotype between cases and controls ( \u03c7\u0382 = 16.17 ; P = 0.0003 ) . The 5A homozygote in patients and controls was significantly different . The frequency of the 5A allele among affected patients ( 67.91% ) was significantly higher than among the healthy controls ( 49% ; \u03c7(2) = 16.17 , P = 0.00005 ) . At the time of diagnosis , individual who was carrying the 5A allele was more represented in the M(+) subgroup than in M(-) subgroup ( chi(2) = 7.49 ; P = 0.006 , OR = 3.86 ; 95% CI , 1.43-10.33 ) . The difference between M(-) and controls did not observe statistically significant ( chi(2) = 0.009 ; P = 0.92 ) . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the presence of 5A polymorphism at the MMP-3 promoter region may favor the growth and the metastasis process in colorectal cancer patients and could be looked at as a risk factor for a worse prognosis .
BACKGROUND Yes Associated Protein ( YAP ) has been implicated in the control of organ size by regulating cell proliferation and survival . YAP is a transcriptional coactivator that controls cellular responses through interaction with TEAD transcription factors in the nucleus , while its transcriptional functions are inhibited by phosphorylation-dependent translocation to the cytosol . YAP overexpression has been associated with different types of cancer , such as lung , skin , prostate , ovary and liver cancer . Recently , YAP was linked to E-cadherin-dependent regulation of contact inhibition in breast cancer cells . RESULTS In this study we examined YAP protein expression and cellular localization in 237 cases of human invasive breast cancer by immunohistochemistry and related its expression to clinicopathological features and E-cadherin expression . We observed that invasive lobular carcinoma is characterized by higher expression levels of both nuclear and cytosolic YAP ( p < 0.001 ) . Nuclear YAP expression did not associate with other variables such as lymph node involvement , tumor grade , tumor size , mitotic activity or the molecular sub-types of invasive breast cancer . We observed that high nuclear and cytosolic YAP expression are associated with the E-cadherin deficient breast cancer subtype ILC ( p < 0.001 ) and cell lines derived from human breast cancers and conditional mouse models of human lobular breast cancer . CONCLUSIONS Since our data indicate that nuclear YAP localization is more common in breast cancers lacking functional adherens junctions , it suggests that YAP-mediated transcription may be involved in the development and progression of invasive lobular breast cancer .
Accumulating data suggest arsenic may be an endocrine disruptor and tentatively linked to breast cancer by some studies . Therefore , we tested the effects of chronic inorganic arsenic exposure on the normal estrogen receptor ( ER)-negative breast epithelial cell line , MCF-10A . Cells were chronically exposed to a low-level arsenite ( 500nM ) for up to 24weeks . Markers of cancer cell phenotype and the expression of critical genes relevant to breast cancer or stem cells ( SCs ) were examined . After 24weeks , chronic arsenic-exposed breast epithelial ( CABE ) cells showed increases in secreted MMP activity , colony formation , invasion , and proliferation rate , indicating an acquired cancer cell phenotype . These CABE cells presented with basal-like breast cancer characteristics , including ER-alpha , HER-2 , and progesterone receptor negativity , and overexpression of K5 and p63 . Putative CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) breast SCs were increased to 80% over control in CABE cells . CABE cells also formed multilayer cell mounds , indicative of loss of contact inhibition . These mounds showed high levels of K5 and p63 , indicating the potential presence of cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) . Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition occurred during arsenic exposure . Overexpression of aromatase , a key rate-limiting enzyme in estrogen synthesis , occurred with arsenic starting early on in exposure . Levels of 17beta-estradiol increased in CABE cells and their conditioned medium . The aromatase inhibitor letrozole abolished arsenic-induced increases in 17beta-estradiol production and reversed cancer cell phenotype . Thus , chronic arsenic exposure drives human breast epithelia into a cancer cell phenotype with an apparent overabundance of putative CSCs . Arsenic appears to transform breast epithelia through overexpression of aromatase , thereby activating oncogenic processes independent of ER .
Cancer cells require glucose to support their rapid growth through a process known as aerobic glycolysis , or the Warburg effect . As in ovarian cancer cells , increased metabolic activity and glucose concentration has been linked to aggressiveness of cancer . However , it is unclear as to whether targeting the glycolytic pathway may kill the malignant cells and likely have broad therapeutic implications against ovarian cancer metastasis . In the present research , we found that EF24 , a HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor , could significantly block glucose uptake , the rate of glycolysis , and lactate production compared with vehicle treatment in SKOV-3 , A2780 and OVCAR-3 cells . These results might possibly contribute to the further observation that EF24 could inhibit ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion from wound healing and Transwell assays . Furthermore , as an important mediator of glucose metabolism , glucose transporter 1 ( Glut1 ) was found to contribute to the function of EF24 in both energy metabolism and metastasis . To examine the effect of EF24 and the mediated role of Glut1 in vivo in a xenograph subcutaneous tumor model , intraperitoneal metastasis and lung metastasis model were introduced . Our results indicated that EF24 treatment could inhibit tumor growth , intraperitoneal metastasis and lung metastasis of SKOV-3 cells , and Glut1 is a possible mediator for the role of EF24 . In conclusion , our results highlight that an anti-cancer reagent with an inhibiting effect on energy metabolism could inhibit metastasis , and EF24 is a possible candidate for anti-metastasis therapeutic applications for ovarian cancer .
BACKGROUND Alcohol consumption promotes hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The responsible mechanisms are not well understood . Hepatocarcinogenesis increases with age and is enhanced by factors that impose a demand for liver regeneration . Because alcohol is hepatotoxic , habitual alcohol ingestion evokes a recurrent demand for hepatic regeneration . The alcohol-preferring ( P ) rat model mimics the level of alcohol consumption by humans who habitually abuse alcohol . Previously , we showed that habitual heavy alcohol ingestion amplified age-related hepatocarcinogenesis in P rats , with over 80% of alcohol-consuming P rats developing HCCs after 18months of alcohol exposure , compared with only 5% of water-drinking controls . METHODS Herein , we used quantitative real-time PCR and quantitative immunocytochemistry to compare liver tissues from alcohol-consuming P rats and water-fed P rat controls after 6 , 12 , or 18months of drinking . We aimed to identify potential mechanisms that might underlie the differences in liver cancer formation and hypothesized that chronic alcohol ingestion would activate Hedgehog ( HH ) , a regenerative signaling pathway that is overactivated in HCC . RESULTS Chronic alcohol ingestion amplified age-related degenerative changes in hepatocytes , but did not cause appreciable liver inflammation or fibrosis even after 18months of heavy drinking . HH signaling was also enhanced by alcohol exposure , as evidenced by increased levels of mRNAs encoding HH ligands , HH-regulated transcription factors , and HH target genes . Immunocytochemistry confirmed increased alcohol-related accumulation of HH ligand-producing cells and HH-responsive target cells . HH-related regenerative responses were also induced in alcohol-exposed rats . Three of these processes ( i.e. , deregulated progenitor expansion , the reverse Warburg effect , and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions ) are known to promote cancer growth in other tissues . CONCLUSIONS Alcohol-related changes in Hedgehog signaling and resultant deregulation of liver cell replacement might promote hepatocarcinogenesis .
Aberrant glucose metabolism characterized by high levels of glycolysis , even in the presence of oxygen , is an important hallmark of cancer . This metabolic reprogramming referred to as the Warburg effect is essential to the survival of tumor cells and provides them with substrates required for biomass generation . Molecular mechanisms responsible for this shift in glucose metabolism remain elusive . As described herein , we found that aberrant expression of the proinflammatory protein transglutaminase 2 ( TG2 ) is an important regulator of the Warburg effect in mammary epithelial cells . Mechanistically , TG2 regulated metabolic reprogramming by constitutively activating nuclear factor ( NF)-\u03baB , which binds to the hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF)-1\u03b1 promoter and induces its expression even under normoxic conditions . TG2/NF-\u03baB-induced increase in HIF-1\u03b1 expression was associated with increased glucose uptake , increased lactate production and decreased oxygen consumption by mitochondria . Experimental suppression of TG2 attenuated HIF-1\u03b1 expression and reversed downstream events in mammary epithelial cells . Moreover , downregulation of p65/RelA or HIF-1\u03b1 expression in these cells restored normal glucose uptake , lactate production , mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic protein expression . Our results suggest that aberrant expression of TG2 is a master regulator of metabolic reprogramming and facilitates metabolic alterations in epithelial cells even under normoxic conditions . A TG2-induced shift in glucose metabolism helps breast cancer cells to survive under stressful conditions and promotes their metastatic competence .
Candida albicans infections are very frequent in cancer patients , whose immune system is often compromised , but whether this fungal pathogen affects cancer progression is unknown . C. albicans infection involves endogenous production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) . Increased levels of these cytokines have already been correlated with metastasis of most common cancer types . In this study , a well-established model of IL-18-dependent hepatic melanoma metastasis was used to study whether C. albicans can alter the ability of murine B16 melanoma ( B16M ) cells to colonize the liver . First , we determined the ability of intrasplenically ( IS ) injected B16M cells to metastasize into the liver of mice challenged with 5 x 10(4) C. albicans cells by three different routes ( intravenous , IV ; intrasplenic , IS ; or intraperitoneal , IP ) 12 h prior to injection of B16M cells . We demonstrated that C. albicans significantly increased metastasis of B16M cells with all three fungal injection routes . Pro-metastatic effects occurred when hepatic colonization with B16M cells place after the peak of TNF-alpha and IL-18 levels had been reached in the hepatic blood of fungal challenged mice . In a second set of experiments , mice were fungal challenged 4 days after injection of B16M cells . In these mice , C. albicans also potentiated the growth of established micro-metastases . Significantly , the fungal challenge had pro-metastatic effects without the C. albicans being able to reach the liver , suggesting that soluble factors can promote metastasis in remote sites . Mouse treatment with antifungal ketoconazol abrogated hepatic TNF-alpha stimulation by C. albicans and prevented the enhancement of hepatic metastasis in fungal challenged-mice . Therefore , the pro-inflammatory microenvironment generated by the host's systemic response to C. albicans stimulates circulating cancer cells to metastasize in the liver .
BACKGROUND The immune system plays an important role in the multifactorial biologic system during the development of neoplasias . However , the involvement of the inflammatory response in the promotion/control of malignant cells is still controversial , and the cell subsets and the mechanisms involved are poorly investigated . The goal of this study was to characterize the clinical-pathological status and the immunophenotyping profile of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and their association with the animal survival rates in canine mammary carcinomas . METHODS Fifty-one animals with mammary carcinomas , classified as carcinomas in mixed tumors-MC-BMT = 31 and carcinomas-MC = 20 were submitted to systematic clinical-pathological analysis ( tumor size ; presence of lymph node and pulmonary metastasis ; clinical stage ; histological grade ; inflammatory distribution and intensity as well as the lymphocytic infiltrate intensity ) and survival rates . Twenty-four animals ( MC-BMT = 16 and MC = 8 ) were elected to the immunophenotypic study performed by flow cytometry . RESULTS Data analysis demonstrated that clinical stage II-IV and histological grade was I more frequent in MC-BMT as compared to MC . Univariate analysis demonstrated that the intensity of inflammation ( moderate/intense ) and the proportion of CD4+ ( > or = 66.7% ) or CD8+ T-cells ( <33.3% ) were not associated with worse survival rate . Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only lymphocytic infiltrate intensity > or = 600 ( P = 0.02 ) remained as independent prognostic factor . Despite the clinical manifestation , the lymphocytes represented the predominant cell type in the tumor infiltrate . The percentage of T-cells was higher in animals with MC-BMT without metastasis , while the percentage of B-lymphocytes was greater in animals with metastasized MC-BMT ( P < 0.05 ) . The relative percentage of CD4+ T-cells was significantly greater in metastasized tumors ( both MC-BMT and MC ) , ( P < 0.05 ) while the proportion of CD8+ T-cells was higher in MC-BMT without metastasis . Consequently , the CD4+/CD8+ ratio was significantly increased in both groups with metastasis . Regardless of the tumor type , the animals with high proportions of CD4+ and low CD8+ T-cells had decreased survival rates . CONCLUSION The intensity of lymphocytic infiltrate and probably the relative abundance of the CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes may represent important survival prognostic biomarkers for canine mammary carcinomas .
Landmark studies of the status of DNA damage checkpoints and associated repair functions in preneoplastic and neoplastic cells has focused attention on importance of these pathways in cancer development , and inhibitors of repair pathways are in clinical trials for treatment of triple negative breast cancer . Cancer heterogeneity suggests that specific cancer subtypes will have distinct mechanisms of DNA damage survival , dependent on biological context . In this study , status of DNA damage response ( DDR)-associated proteins was examined in breast cancer subtypes in association with clinical features ; 479 breast cancers were examined for expression of DDR proteins gammaH2AX , BRCA1 , pChk2 , and p53 , DNA damage-sensitive tumor suppressors Fhit and Wwox , and Wwox-interacting proteins Ap2alpha , Ap2gamma , ErbB4 , and correlations among proteins , tumor subtypes , and clinical features were assessed . In a multivariable model , triple negative cancers showed significantly reduced Fhit and Wwox , increased p53 and Ap2gamma protein expression , and were significantly more likely than other subtype tumors to exhibit aberrant expression of two or more DDR-associated proteins . Disease-free survival was associated with subtype , Fhit and membrane ErbB4 expression level and aberrant expression of multiple DDR-associated proteins . These results suggest that definition of specific DNA repair and checkpoint defects in subgroups of triple negative cancer might identify new treatment targets . Expression of Wwox and its interactor , ErbB4 , was highly significantly reduced in metastatic tissues vs. matched primary tissues , suggesting that Wwox signal pathway loss contributes to lymph node metastasis , perhaps by allowing survival of tumor cells that have detached from basement membranes , as proposed for the role of Wwox in ovarian cancer spread .
