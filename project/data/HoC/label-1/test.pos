Induction of the expression of the Mr 67,000 high-affinity laminin receptor gene has been postulated as playing a role in the progression of human tumors to invasive cancers . We tested this hypothesis by examining histopathological sections of a large number of epithelial lesions of the genital tract associated with human papillomaviruses . In situ hybridization was performed with a riboprobe generated from a laminin receptor complementary DNA . Laminin receptor mRNA was expressed primarily in the less differentiated cells in normal squamous tissues and in a spectrum of squamous neoplasms . There was no net induction of mRNA per cell in intraepithelial or invasive squamous neoplasms relative to normal tissue . In contrast , laminin receptor mRNA was not expressed at a detectable level in normal glands of the uterine cervix but was dramatically induced in morphologically abnormal , human papillomavirus-positive glands , irrespective of the genotype of human papillomaviruses present . The induction occurred before any evidence of invasion , and there was no further increase during the transition from adenocarcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma . We conclude that induction of high-affinity laminin receptor gene expression is associated with the development of malignancies of cervical glandular epithelia , but the increased expression appears to correlate with the proliferative rather than the invasive properties of these cells .
Among salivary gland neoplasms are a group of rare tumors that are histologically identical to benign mixed tumors that inexplicably metastasize ; they have been called metastasizing mixed tumor ( MZMT ) of salivary glands . We report the clinicopathologic features and flow cytometric findings for 11 cases of MZMT . At the time of discovery of metastatic disease , the patients , six women and five men , ranged in age from 20 to 83 years . Primary sites of involvement included the parotid gland ( eight cases ) , submandibular gland ( two cases ) , and the nasal septum ( one case ) . With one exception , all the patients had at least a single recurrences of their primary mixed tumor , but two or more recurrences were the norm before development of metastatic foci . The metastases were discovered from six to 52 years following the occurrence of the primary tumor . Metastatic deposits were identified in bone , lung , regional lymph nodes , skin , kidney , retroperitoneum , oral cavity , pharynx , calvarium , and central nervous system . The metastases either occurred simultaneously with an episode of recurrent mixed tumor ( n = 5 ) or from 5 to 29 years after a recurrence ( n = 6 ) . The treatment of the primary , recurrent , and metastatic neoplasms was surgical excision . Follow-up , ranging from 8 months to 16 years following the diagnosis of MZMT , revealed seven patients to be alive without disease ( 64% ) and two dead of causes unrelated to metastatic disease ( 18% ) . Two patients ( 18% ) died as a direct result of metastatic tumor at 3 and 2 years after metastasis of their mixed tumors . Flow cytometric analysis revealed a diploid DNA cell population in the primary and/or metastatic tumors in nine cases . Aneuploid DNA cell content was identified in two of the cases . DNA ploidy levels and cell proliferation rates were compared with those of conventional benign mixed tumors and also with malignant mixed tumors . Retrospective analysis of histologic parameters ( mitotic rate , cellular pleomorphism , infiltrative growth , vascular or lymphatic invasion ) and flow cytometric analysis failed to identify criteria to predict the development of metastasis in these neoplasms .
Numerous studies have reported a correlation between production of 72-kDa ( MMP-2 ) and 92-kDa ( MMP-9 ) type-IV collagenases/gelatinases and the metastatic potential of cancer cells . An abrogating effect of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 ) on metastases has also been noted . In this report we have used sensitive enzyme-linked immunoassays to measure MMP-2 , MMP-9 , TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 levels in eight human lung-cancer cell lines which were characterized for biological behavior in nude mice . We demonstrated that the Calu-6 and A549 cell lines with the highest metastatic , invasive and tumorigenic potential secreted the highest levels of MMP-2 . MMP-9 and TIMP-1 secretions were comparatively low in all cell lines . TIMP-2 secretion , which exceeded MMP-2 secretion for all cell lines , did not correlate with metastatic potential . To further explore these correlations , the metastatic Calu-6 cell line was transfected with a K-rev-1 cDNA expression construct . The K-rev revertant cell lines demonstrated a more differentiated phenotype and were less tumorigenic , invasive and metastatic in nude mice . Nonetheless , the Calu-6 revertant cell lines secreted higher levels of MMP-2 than the parent cell line . In conclusion , invasion and metastasis by lung-cancer cells requires not only enhanced MMP production , but also other less well-understood tumorigenic characteristics . The multiplicity of factors required by cancer cells for dissemination helps to explain the minute fraction of cancer cells from a primary tumor that ever develop into a metastasis .
This study aims to identify significant predictors of survival in pediatric and adolescent colorectal carcinoma . We retrospectively analyzed our experience with 29 histologically verified cases , of which 20 were resected for cure . Variables analyzed as predictors of survival included : ( 1 ) resectability , ( 2 ) regional nodal involvement , ( 3 ) depth of invasion , ( 4 ) grade , and ( 5 ) interval from symptom onset to diagnosis . Signet ring or anaplastic lesions were considered high grade . Survival curves were generated on both the overall group and those resected for cure . Multivariate analysis was performed on the overall group . The median age at diagnosis was 19 years ( range , 10 to 21 ) . Median follow-up in survivors was 4.7 years . Signet ring tumors occurred in 45% and another 24% were poorly differentiated . Seventy-six percent presented with regional lymph node metastases . The median survival for the overall group was 16 months , whereas that for those undergoing complete resection was 33 months . In patients undergoing resection for cure , grade ( P = .005 ) , regional nodal involvement ( P = .007 ) , and depth of invasion ( P = .03 ) were significant predictors of outcome in univariate analysis . In the overall group these variables as well as resectability and distant metastases were significant in univariate analysis . In multivariate analysis high-grade lesions and lymph node involvement were highly correlated , as were resectability and metastases . Thus , either variable ( but not both ) of each pair added information to the multivariate model . In patients resected for cure , positive nodes or high histological grade became the only significant predictors of survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Tricyclic antidepressants , such as amitriptyline ( Elavil ) , and the nontricyclic agent , fluoxetine ( Prozac ) , bind to growth-regulatory intracellular histamine receptors , associated with anti-estrogen binding sites in microsomes and nuclei . The prototype anti-estrogen binding site/intracellular histamine receptor ligand , N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]ethanamine HCl , inhibits normal cell proliferation in vitro but stimulates tumor growth in vivo . Because of their structural similarity to N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]ethanamine HCl , we carried out studies to determine whether amitriptyline and fluoxetine stimulate tumor growth and/or development in rodents at concentrations relevant to the treatment of human depression ( equivalent human dose range , approximately 100-150 mg/day for amitriptyline and approximately 20-80 mg/day for fluoxetine ) . All experiments were performed blinded . In studies of growth stimulation of transplantable syngeneic tumors , groups of mice were inoculated s.c. with C-3 fibrosarcoma cells or given i.v. or s.c. injections of B16f10 melanoma cells , followed 24 h later by daily i.p. injections of saline , amitriptyline , or fluoxetine . Tumor latency ( fibrosarcoma ) , aggregate tumor weight ( s.c. injected melanoma ) , or time to death from pulmonary metastasis ( i.v. injected melanoma ) was determined ; drug-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis in C-3 fibrosarcoma cells in vitro was correlated with tumor growth acceleration in vivo . In a mammary carcinogenesis model , the effects of chronic saline , amitriptyline , or fluoxetine administration on the rate and frequency of development of mammary tumors in rats fed dimethylbenzanthracene ( DMBA ) were compared . Eight of 20 amitriptyline- or fluoxetine-treated mice developed fibrosarcoma tumors by day 5 , as compared to none of 20 saline controls ( P less than 0.002 ) . Similarly , 20 of 21 DMBA-treated rats receiving the antidepressant drugs developed 33 mammary tumors by week 15 as compared to 5 tumors in 4 of 7 DMBA-treated rats receiving saline ( P less than 0.001 ) . For both models , tumor latency decreased 30-40% and , in the DMBA model , tumor frequency increased greater than 2-fold in the antidepressant-treated rats as compared to controls . Stimulation of fibrosarcoma growth in vivo correlated with a corresponding bell-shaped drug-induced increase in DNA synthesis in vitro . While the median time to death from pulmonary metastases did not differ among groups given i.v. injections of melanoma cells , a significant ( P less than 0.01 ) stimulation of growth of s.c. injected melanoma was observed in mice receiving the antidepressants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS )
Overexpression and amplification of cyclin D1 were investigated by immunohistochemistry and differential polymerase chain reaction ( dPCR ) in 440 formalin-fixed primary breast carcinoma tissues . Overexpression of cyclin D1 was detected in 60% ( 263/440 ) and amplification of cyclin D1 was noted in 27% ( 119/440 ) of the primary breast carcinomas . Molecular analysis demonstrated that cyclin D1 was amplified in 30% ( 7/23 ) of the comedo DCIS , 22% ( 9/41 ) of the comedo DCIS and 32% ( 13/41 ) of the adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas , 30% ( 82/270 ) of the invasive ductal carcinomas , 27% ( 9/33 ) of the invasive lobular carcinomas , 19% ( 4/21 ) of the colloid carcinomas and 13% ( 2/15 ) of the medullary carcinomas . Cyclin D1 was amplified in 11% ( 2/19 ) of the invasive ductal carcinomas but not in the adjacent non-comedo DCIS lesions . Our observation showed that cyclin D1 was strongly positive in 61% ( 14/23 ) of the comedo subtype , 61% ( 11/18 ) of the non-comedo subtype , 59% ( 24/41 ) of the comedo DCIS and 63% ( 26/41 ) of the adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas , 53% ( 10/19 ) of the non-comedo DCIS and 58% ( 11/19 ) of the adjacent invasive lesions , 58% ( 157/270 ) of the invasive ductal carcinomas , 73% ( 24/33 ) of the invasive lobular carcinomas , 52% ( 11/21 ) of the colloid carcinomas and 27% ( 4/15 ) of the medullary carcinomas . A significant association was observed between in situ components and adjacent invasive lesions for cyclin D1 expression ( p<0.05 ) and amplification ( p<0.05 ) . A significant relationship was noted between amplification of cyclin D1 and lymph node metastases ( p<0.05 ) but not with histological grade ( p>0.05 ) , estrogen receptor status ( p>0.05 ) and proliferation index ( Ki-67 and PCNA ) ( p>0.05 ) . However , overexpression of cyclin D1 was statistically associated with well differentiated tumors ( p<0.05 ) and estrogen receptor positivity ( p<0.05 ) . No relationship was seen with nodal status ( p>0.05 ) and proliferation index ( Ki-67 and PCNA ) ( p>0.05 ) . These observations suggest that tumors positive for cyclin D1 protein may have features of good prognosis but amplification of cyclin D1 gene could be an indicator of tumors with poor prognostic features . Although majority of the Malaysian patients belong to younger age group ( <50 years old ) , amplification and expression of cyclin D1 was not statistically associated with patient age ( p>0.05 ) . These observations indicate that amplification and up-regulation of cyclin D1 may be independent of patient age . Moreover , overexpression and amplification of cyclin D1 in preinvasive , preinvasive and adjacent invasive lesions , and invasive carcinomas suggest that the gene may play an important role in early and late stages of breast carcinogenesis .
Interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) has pleiotropic activities other than its antivirus action , including cell growth inhibition , natural killer ( NK ) cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) activation , and angiogenesis inhibitory activity , and these activities are supposed to be involved in its antitumour activity . However , it has not been completely elucidated which activity is mainly involved in the tumour suppression in vivo . In this study , we analysed inhibitory mechanisms of endogenous IFN-gamma against B16 melanoma experimental metastasis . After intravenous injection of tumour cells , tumour deposits in the lungs and liver were increased and life span was shorter in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice , indicating important roles for IFN-gamma in antitumour mechanisms . Interestingly , tumour deposits were not increased in IFN-gamma receptor ( R)(-/- ) mice . Furthermore , only low levels of cell-mediated immunity against the tumour and activation of NK cells were observed , indicating that antimetastatic effects of IFN-gamma is not mediated by host cells . The survival period of B16 melanoma-bearing IFN-gamma R(-/-) mice was , however , shorter than wild-type mice . These observations suggest that IFN-gamma prevents B16 melanoma experimental metastasis by directly inhibiting the cell growth , although antitumour host functions may also be involved in a later phase .
BACKGROUND/AIMS Endoscopic mucosal resection and laparoscopic wedge resection have become more common in the treatment of early gastric cancer . However , lymph node metastasis is a major poor prognostic factor influencing tumor recurrence and survival . To predict the risk of lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer , the authors conducted a study to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of early gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis . METHODOLOGY From 1982 to 1998 , 181 patients of early gastric cancer underwent primary surgery and were included in the study . Patient data was postoperatively reviewed regarding age , gender , tumor size , depth of invasion , histologic differentiation , macroscopic classification and anatomic level of lymph node metastasis . The chi 2 test or Student's t test was used for statistical analysis . Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis . RESULTS Lymph node metastasis was observed in 19 cases ( 11% ) . Early gastric cancer with size larger than 4 cm ( P < 0.05 ) , with submucosal invasion ( P < 0.01 ) , and with poor differentiation ( P < 0.05 ) was associated with higher risk of lymph node metastasis . The macroscopic classification had no predictive value . Multivariate analysis showed that submucosal invasion correlated best with lymph node spread ( OR 10.25 , 95% CI : 2.10-49.96 ) , followed by tumor size larger than 4 cm ( OR 4.99 , 95% CI : 1.46-17.05 ) , and poorly differentiated histological subtype ( OR 3.31 , 95% CI : 1.16-9.45 ) . CONCLUSIONS Poor differentiation , submucosal invasion and large tumor size were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer . Macroscopic classification was not correlated with lymph node metastasis .
Telomerase activity , a cardinal requirement for immortalization , is a crucial step in the development of cancer and has been studied in many kinds of malignant tumours for clinical diagnostic and/or prognostic utilities . Using a PCR-based TRAP assay , we investigated telomerase activity in 8 adenomatous polyps , 9 dysplastic polyps , and in 36 paired cancer-normal mucosa specimens , one liver and one spleen metastasis from patients resected for sporadic colorectal cancer . Telomerase was absent or very low in normal mucosa and in adenomatous polyps . Dysplastic polyps and adenocarcinoma samples showed telomerase activity , with higher levels in cancer tissues compared to dysplastic lesions . A high telomerase activity was shown to be associated with late-staged cancers and metastasis , providing arguments supporting the role of telomerase not only in the development but also in the progression of colorectal carcinoma . Moreover , telomerase evaluation may help to confirm the malignant transformation in polypoid colorectal lesions with different levels of dysplastic alterations .
Tumor cells are elusive targets for immunotherapy due to their heterogeneity and genetic instability . Here we describe a novel , oral DNA vaccine that targets stable , proliferating endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature rather than tumor cells . Targeting occurs through upregulated vascular-endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( FLK-1 ) of proliferating endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature . This vaccine effectively protected mice from lethal challenges with melanoma , colon carcinoma and lung carcinoma cells and reduced growth of established metastases in a therapeutic setting . CTL-mediated killing of endothelial cells indicated breaking of peripheral immune tolerance against this self antigen , resulting in markedly reduced dissemination of spontaneous and experimental pulmonary metastases . Angiogenesis in the tumor vasculature was suppressed without impairment of fertility , neuromuscular performance or hematopoiesis , albeit with a slight delay in wound healing . Our strategy circumvents problems in targeting of genetically unstable tumor cells . This approach may provide a new strategy for the rational design of cancer therapies .
The triterpenoid fraction ( 100 and 200 mg/kg ) of the fruit bodies of Ganoderma lucidum inhibited primary solid-tumor growth in the spleen , liver metastasis and secondary metastatic tumor growth in the liver in intrasplenic Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC)-implanted mice . In addition , the triterpenoid fraction ( 800 micrograms/mL ) inhibited angiogenesis induced by Matrigel ( a soluble basement membrane extract of the Engelbreth-Holm-Swam ( EHS ) tumor ) supplemented with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and heparin in an in vivo model . This suggested that the antitumor and antimetastatic activities of the triterpenoid fraction of G. lucidum might be due to the inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis . Next , we attempted to isolate the active substance(s) using the in vivo assay system of Matrigel-induced angiogenesis . The acidic fraction of the triterpenoid fraction inhibited the Matrigel-induced angiogenesis . Compound I was isolated from the acidic fraction as an active substance that inhibited the Martigel-induced angiogenesis . Compound I was identified as ganoderic acid F based on the data of IR , 1H- and 13C-NMR and MS analyses .
The effects of dose per fraction on the ability of amifostine exposure to elevate angiostatin levels in the serum of mice and to inhibit spontaneous metastases formation using the well-characterized murine Sa-NH sarcoma were investigated . Amifostine was administered intraperitoneally at doses of 50 , 100 , or 200 mg/kg every other day for 6 days to C3Hf/Kam mice until tumors reached an average size of 8 mm in diameter . Amifostine was again administered immediately following surgical removal of the tumor-bearing limbs by amputation , and then once more 2 days later . Nontumor-bearing control animals were treated using the same dosing and surgery schedules . The average number of pulmonary metastases per animal was determined for each experimental group . A significant reduction ( P <.05 ) in the average number of pulmonary metastases was observed only in the group of animals exposed to a dose per fraction of 50 mg/kg . A dose of 100 mg/kg was less effective while 200 mg/kg had no effect on metastases formation in this study . The effects of amifostine exposure on serum levels of the angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin were also determined using Western analysis . Correlating with the antimetastatic effect measured , exposure of animals to 50 mg/kg of amifostine resulted in a four-fold enhanced serum level of angiostatin above control levels . This phenomenon occurred in both tumor-bearing as well as nontumor-bearing animals . In contrast , a dose of 200-mg/kg amifostine administered intraperitoneally under these conditions had no measurable effect on angiostatin serum levels in this animal system . The enhanced ability of relatively low doses of amifostine to inhibit spontaneous metastases formation suggests that effective antimetastatic therapies with amifostine can be designed with minimal toxic side effects . While the dose responses for angiostatin production and metastases inhibition by amifostine are well correlated , the precise mechanism of action underlying these phenomena is unclear but is suggestive of a redox driven process(es) .
During the period of 1996-1998 ninety-four gastrectomy specimens with gastric carcinoma referred to Erciyes University , Medical Faculty , Department of Pathology , were examined histopathologically , histochemically and immunohistochemically . General characteristics of gastric carcinomas and prognostic factors were studied . According the Lauren classification , of the 94 cases of gastric carcinomas , 56 were intestinal type , 21 were diffuse type and 17 were mixed type carcinoma . The association rates of Helicobacter pylori , chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia with gastric carcinomas were high . There was strong immunorectivity with HSP70 in 62,5% of the intestinal type carcinomas . This ratios were lower in diffuse and mixed type carcinomas ( p<0.05 ) . The more tumor size and invasion depth increased , the more HSP70 immunoreactivity was obtained ( p<0.05 ) . HSP70 immunorectivity was considerably higher in the patients having lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion ( p<0.05 ) . It was found that the NK cell number was low in the tumor but higher around the tumor in early gastric carcinomas , compared with advanced carcinomas ( p>0.05 ) . In the tumors larger than 10 cm with vascular invasion , NK cell number was lower around the tumor ( p>0.05 ) . Defining prognostic factors of gastric carcinomas is of importance to clinicians . It is thought that HSP70 immunoreactivity , besides invasion depth , lymph node metastasis , vascular invasion , tumor size and inflammatory reaction against the tumor , is important in prognosis and associated with advanced stage .
OBJECTIVE The aims of this study were to analyse the results and long term outcome in a prospective non randomised trial of 74 patients treated by laparoscopic colo-rectal resection for cancer , and to determine wether survival and recurrence are or are not compromised by an initial laparoscopic approach . PATIENTS AND METHODS Seventy-four patients with colo-rectal carcinoma were included in a prospective trial and treated by laparoscopic resection . All patients were reviewed at 1 , 3 , and 6 months interval . A median of 5 years follow up was available . Forty-eight patients ( 65% ) had more than 3 years of follow up . RESULTS Six conversions ( 8.1% ) were necessary : 2 for tumor invasion of adjacent organs , 2 for limited margin resection in lower rectal tumors , 1 for small bowel injury and 1 for obesity . After surgery , passing flatus occurred at 34.3 +/- 16.7 h and oral intake could be reinstaured at 42.6 +/- 22 h . Mean postoperative stay was 8.2 +/- 3.4 days . No death occurred . The overall morbidity was about 13.5% . The rate of late complications was 5.4% . Two port site metastasis ( 2.6% ) were seen in locally advanced carcinoma . Recurrence rate at 5 years was 0% for Dukes A , 20% for Dukes B , 39.2% for Dukes C. Survival rate at 5 years was 100% for Dukes A , 80% for Dukes B , and 60.7% for Dukes C. These results are similar to those of conventional open surgery . CONCLUSION Laparoscopic colorectal resection for cancer can be performed safely , with a low morbidity and rare late complications . Long term follow up ( 5 years ) assessment shows similar outcome compared with conventional surgery .
Hexavalent chromium ( Cr(VI) ) compounds are known human carcinogens associated with the incidence of lung cancer . Although a direct correlation between Cr(VI) exposure and lung cancer has been established , several studies aimed at generating animal models for Cr(VI) have yielded inconsistent data that do not affirmatively support findings from epidemiologic studies . Because the lack of a good animal model has hindered the identification of molecular mechanisms involved in Cr(VI) exposure , we developed an in vitro model that facilitates mechanistic studies of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis . We report here that long-term exposure to Cr(VI) leads to the malignant transformation of nontumorigenic human lung epithelial cells . Cr(VI)-transformed cells exhibited loss of contact inhibition , colony formation , and increased rates of cell invasion , migration , and proliferation , as compared with passage-matched control cells . Cr(VI)-transformed cells evaded apoptosis by a mechanism involving S-nitrosylation and stabilization of Bcl-2 protein in a nitric oxide-dependent manner . This study establishes an important in vitro model that facilitates mechanistic studies of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis , and elucidates a novel mechanism that causes apoptosis-resistant malignant transformation of nontumorigenic lung cells in response to a human carcinogen .
BACKGROUND The current staging system provides an anatomical classification of lung tumors ; its secondary purpose is to allow the prognostic stratification of patients into homogeneous groups after surgery . In this work , intratumoral perineural invasion , lymphatic and blood vessel invasion together with the necrosis content of the tumor exclusive of the non-small cell cancer staging system were studied . METHODS During a 4-year period , 152 patients operated for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) at our hospital were analyzed . Mean age of patients was 55.7 +/- 10.1 years . RESULTS Overall 5-year survival was 42.2 % . Mediastinal lymph node involvement , tumor size , incomplete resection , pneumonectomy , presence of necrosis and perineural invasion were significant prognosticators ( P = 0.03 , 0.04 , 0.0001 , 0.046 , 0.0246 , < 0.0001 , respectively ) . Multivariate analysis revealed that N status , perineural invasion , and the presence of necrosis were independent prognostic factors ( P = 0.006 , P = 0.001 , P = 0.001 , respectively ) . Patients who had stage I tumor with necrosis and perineural invasion had a lower survival rate than those with stage IIIA tumor without these histopathological features ( P = 0.04 ) . The presence of these histopathological characteristics in stage IIIA patients was a sign of a poorer prognosis ( P = 0.0001 ) . CONCLUSIONS Perineural invasion and the presence of necrosis independently indicated a dismal prognosis and their prognostic power is comparable to those of the TNM classification . These factors could be candidates for better survival stratification and the indicators of the need for adjuvant therapy in early stage lung cancer patients .
BACKGROUND The importance of cell-surface nucleolin in cancer biology was recently highlighted by studies showing that ligands of nucleolin play critical role in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis . By using a specific antagonist that binds the C-terminal tail of nucleolin , the HB-19 pseudopeptide , we recently reported that HB-19 treatment markedly suppressed the progression of established human breast tumor cell xenografts in the athymic nude mice without apparent toxicity . METHODS The in vivo antitumoral action of HB-19 treatment was assessed on the spontaneous development of melanoma in the RET transgenic mouse model . Ten days old RET mice were treated with HB-19 in a prophylactic setting that extended 300 days . In parallel , the molecular basis for the action of HB-19 was investigated on a melanoma cell line ( called TIII ) derived from a cutaneous nodule of a RET mouse . RESULTS HB-19 treatment of RET mice caused a significant delay in the onset of cutaneous tumors , several-months delay in the incidence of large tumors , a lower frequency of cutaneous nodules , and a reduction of visceral metastatic nodules while displaying no toxicity to normal tissue . Moreover , microvessel density was significantly reduced in tumors recovered from HB-19 treated mice compared to corresponding controls . Studies on the melanoma-derived tumor cells demonstrated that HB-19 treatment of TIII cells could restore contact inhibition , impair anchorage-independent growth , and reduce their tumorigenic potential in mice . Moreover , HB-19 treatment caused selective down regulation of transcripts coding matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 , and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the TIII cells and in melanoma tumors of RET mice . CONCLUSIONS Although HB-19 treatment failed to prevent the development of spontaneous melanoma in the RET mice , it delayed for several months the onset and frequency of cutaneous tumors , and exerted a significant inhibitory effect on visceral metastasis . Consequently , HB-19 could provide a novel therapeutic agent by itself or as an adjuvant therapy in association with current therapeutic interventions on a virulent cancer like melanoma .
In this study , we compared the effects of SKI-606 with Iressa , Src/Abl and EGF-R kinase inhibitors , respectively , on selected parameters in HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cell lines , which express E6/E7 oncoproteins of high-risk HPV types 18 and 16 , respectively . Our results show that SKI-606 and Iressa inhibit cell proliferation and provoke G(0)-G(1) cell cycle arrest and reduction of S and G(2)-M phase using 2 and 5 muM concentrations of these inhibitors . In contrast , SKI-606 induces differentiation to an epithelial phenotype " mesenchymal-epithelial transition " ; thus SKI-606 causes a dramatic decrease in cell motility and invasion abilities of HeLa and SiHa cancer cells , in comparison to untreated cells and Iressa-treated cells in which these parameters are only slightly affected . These changes are accompanied by a regulation of the expression patterns of E-cadherin and catenins . The molecular pathway analysis of Src/Abl inhibitor revealed that SKI-606 blocks the phosphorylation of beta-catenin and consequently converts its role from a transcriptional regulator to a cell-cell adhesion molecule . Our findings indicate that SKI-606 inhibits signaling pathways involved in regulating tumor cell migration and invasion genes via beta-catenin alteration , suggesting that Src inhibitor , in comparison to EGF-R , is a promising therapeutic agent for human cervical cancer .
Aberrant expression and polymorphism of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 ( FGFR4 ) has been linked to tumor progression and anticancer drug resistance . We describe here a novel mechanism of tumor progression by matrix degradation involving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in response to membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase ( MT1-MMP , MMP-14 ) induction at the edge of tumors expressing the FGFR4-R388 risk variant . Both FGFR4 and MT1-MMP were upregulated in tissue biopsies from several human cancer types including breast adenocarcinomas , where they were partially coexpressed at the tumor/stroma border and tumor invasion front . The strongest overall coexpression was found in prostate carcinoma . Studies with cultured prostate carcinoma cell lines showed that the FGFR4-R388 variant , which has previously been associated with poor cancer prognosis , increased MT1-MMP-dependent collagen invasion . In this experimental model , knockdown of FGFR4-R388 or MT1-MMP by RNA interference blocked tumor cell invasion and growth in collagen . This was coupled with impaired phosphorylation of FGFR substrate 2 and Src , upregulation of E-cadherin , and suppression of cadherin-11 and N-cadherin . These in vitro results were substantiated by reduced MT1-MMP content and in vivo growth of prostate carcinoma cells after the FGFR4-R388 gene silencing . In contrast , knockdown of the alternative FGFR4-G388 allele enhanced MT1-MMP and invasive tumor cell growth in vivo and within three-dimensional collagen . These results will help to explain the reported association of the FGFR4-R388 variant with the progression and poor prognosis of certain types of tumors .
Overexpression of the melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 ( MDA-7)/IL-24 in vitro generally results in the growth suppression and induction of apoptosis of diverse human tumor cells . In this study , we investigated the effects of overexpression of the MDA-7/IL-24 gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells in vitro and in vivo . Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of MDA-7 facilitated the MDA-7/IL-24-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in HCC cells , but not in the normal liver cell line L02 , and the effect was independent of the p53 status . Inhibition of metastasis and angiogenesis was correlated with decreasing expression of STAT3 , P-STAT3 , MMP-2 , VEGF , and TGF-beta genes , regulated by STAT3 in MHCCLM6 cells . We also showed that Ad.mda-7 combined with doxorubicin ( ADM ) had significantly enhanced antitumor and antimetastatic effects in vivo , accompanied by the downregulation of VEGF , MMP-2 , and TGF-beta genes and the upregulation of E-cadherin genes . These data suggested that MDA-7/IL-24 induces its selective antitumor properties in HCC cells by promoting apoptosis independent of p53 status , inhibiting subcutaneous tumor growth and metastasis , and increasing the effect of chemotherapeutic agents . MDA-7/IL-24 represents a new class of cancer suppressor genes that may be useful in the targeted therapy of HCC .
Melanoma cells express and interact with laminins ( LMs ) and other basement membrane components during invasion and metastasis . In the present study we have investigated the production and migration-promoting activity of laminin isoforms in melanoma . Immunohistochemistry of melanoma specimens and immunoprecipitation/western blotting of melanoma cell lines indicated expression of laminin-111/121 , laminin-211 , laminin-411/421 , and laminin-511/521 . Laminin-332 was not detected . In functional assays , laminin-111 , laminin-332 , and laminin-511 , but not laminin-211 and laminin-411 , strongly promoted haptotactic cell migration either constitutively or following stimulation with insulin-like growth factors . Both placenta and recombinant laminin-511 preparations were highly active , and the isolated recombinant IVa domain of LMalpha5 also promoted cell migration . Function-blocking antibodies in cell migration assays revealed alpha6beta1 integrin as the major receptor for laminin-111 , and both alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1 integrins for laminin-332 and laminin-511 . In contrast , isolated LMalpha5 IVa domain-promoted melanoma cell migration was largely mediated via alphaVbeta3 integrin and inhibited by RGD peptides . Given the ubiquitous expression of alpha5 laminins in melanoma cells and in melanoma-target tissues/anatomical structures , as well as the strong migration-promoting activity of these laminin isoforms , the alpha5 laminins emerge as putative primary extracellular matrix mediators of melanoma invasion and metastasis via alpha3beta1 and other integrin receptors .
BACKGROUND Surgical procedures such as liver resection and liver transplantation are the first-line treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patients . However , the high incidence of tumor recurrence and metastasis after liver surgery remains a major problem . Recent studies have shown that hepatic ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R ) injury and endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) contribute to tumor growth and metastasis . We aim to investigate the mechanism of FTY720 , which was originally applied as an immunomodulator , on suppression of liver tumor metastasis after liver resection and partial hepatic I/R injury . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS An orthotopic liver tumor model in Buffalo rat was established using the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line McA-RH7777 . Two weeks after orthotopic liver tumor implantation , the rats underwent liver resection for tumor-bearing lobe and partial hepatic I/R injury . FTY720 ( 2 mg/kg ) was administered through the inferior caval vein before and after I/R injury . Blood samples were taken at days 0 , 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 and 28 for detection of circulating EPCs ( CD133+CD34+ ) . Our results showed that intrahepatic and lung metastases were significantly inhibited together with less tumor angiogenesis by FTY720 treatment . The number of circulating EPCs was also significantly decreased by FTY720 treatment from day 7 to day 28 . Hepatic gene expressions of CXCL10 , VEGF , CXCR3 , CXCR4 induced by hepatic I/R injury were down-regulated in the treatment group . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE FTY720 suppressed liver tumor metastasis after liver resection marred by hepatic I/R injury in a rat liver tumor model by attenuating hepatic I/R injury and reducing circulating EPCs .
Keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF , fibroblast growth factor-7 ) is a fibroblast-derived mitogen , which stimulates proliferation of epithelial cells . The expression of KGF by dermal fibroblasts is induced following injury and it promotes wound repair . However , the role of KGF in cutaneous carcinogenesis and cancer progression is not known . We have examined the role of KGF in progression of squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the skin . The expression of KGF receptor ( KGFR ) mRNA was lower in cutaneous SCCs ( n = 6 ) than in normal skin samples ( n = 6 ) . Expression of KGFR mRNA was detected in 6 out of 8 cutaneous SCC cell lines and the levels were downregulated by 24-h treatment with KGF . KGF did not stimulate SCC cell proliferation , but it reduced invasion of SCC cells through collagen . Gene expression profiling of three cutaneous SCC cell lines treated with KGF for 24 h revealed a specific gene expression signature characterized by upregulation of a set of genes specifically downregulated in SCC cells compared to normal epidermal keratinocytes , including genes with tumor suppressing properties ( SPRY4 , DUSP4 , DUSP6 , LRIG1 , PHLDA1 ) . KGF also induced downregulation of a set of genes specifically upregulated in SCC cells compared to normal keratinocytes , including genes associated with tumor progression ( MMP13 , MATN2 , CXCL10 , and IGFBP3 ) . Downregulation of MMP-13 and KGFR expression in SCC cells and HaCaT cells was mediated via ERK1/2 . Activation of ERK1/2 in HaCaT cells and tumorigenic Ha-ras-transformed HaCaT cells resulted in downregulation of MMP-13 and KGFR expression . These results provide evidence , that KGF does not promote progression of cutaneous SCC , but rather suppresses the malignant phenotype of cutaneous SCC cells by regulating the expression of several genes differentially expressed in SCC cells , as compared to normal keratinocytes .
The Salvador/Warts/Hippo ( Hippo ) signaling pathway defines a novel signaling cascade regulating cell contact inhibition , organ size control , cell growth , proliferation , apoptosis and cancer development in mammals . The upstream regulation of this pathway has been less well defined than the core kinase cassette . KIBRA has been shown to function as an upstream member of the Hippo pathway by influencing the phosphorylation of LATS and YAP , but functional consequences of these biochemical changes have not been previously addressed . We show that in MCF10A cells , loss of KIBRA expression displays epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) features , which are concomitant with decreased LATS and YAP phosphorylation , but not MST1/2 . In addition , ectopic KIBRA expression antagonizes YAP via the serine 127 phosphorylation site and we show that KIBRA , Willin and Merlin differentially regulate genes controlled by YAP . Finally , reduced KIBRA expression in primary breast cancer specimens correlates with the recently described claudin-low subtype , an aggressive sub-group with EMT features and a poor prognosis .
Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide . Major risk factors of HCC include infection with hepatitis B or C viruses , alcohol and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . HCC is difficult to diagnose at early stage , and has a very poor survival rate when diagnosed at a late stage . The majority of HCC-related deaths result from local invasion ( to cause liver failure ) or distant metastases . There is an urgent need to identify effective molecular targets for the treatment of the disease . As the target of an established class of therapeutic agent thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) has been widely studied for its role in the development of HCC . A substantial body of evidence based on in vitro and in vivo models indicates that the activation of PPARgamma is able to inhibit HCC cell proliferation and tumor growth through inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the regulation of a panel of downstream effector molecules . PPARgamma activation also induces an inhibitory effect on HCC metastasis . Meanwhile , there is new evidence suggesting that PPARgamma inhibition could also be anti-tumorigenic . In the present review , we summarize the available information on the role of PPARgamma in HCC development and spread , and discuss whether PPARgamma activation by TZDs could play a role in the treatment of HCC , summarizing both in vitro and in vivo . Considering the available data , PPARgamma seems to exert beneficial effects against HCC and may therefore represent as a therapeutic target .
Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , accounting for 80% of lung cancers , is the leading cause of all cancer deaths . Previously , we demonstrated that delta-tocotrienol inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation , invasion and induces apoptosis by down-regulation of the Notch-1 signaling pathway . The objective of this study was to investigate whether delta-tocotrienol , could enhance the anticancer effects of cisplatin . Treatment with a combination of delta-tocotrienol and cisplatin resulted in a dose-dependent , significant inhibition of cell growth , migration , invasiveness , and induction of apoptosis in NSCLC cells , as compared to the single agents . This was associated with a decrease in NF-kappaB DNA binding activity , decrease in Notch-1 , Hes-1 , Bcl-2 and increase in cleaved Caspase-3 and PARP expressions . These results suggest that down-regulation of Notch-1 , via inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling pathways by delta-tocotrienol and cisplatin , in combination , could provide a potential novel approach for tumor arrest in NSCLC , while lowering the effective dose of cisplatin .
Circulating tumour cells ( CTCs ) shed into blood from primary cancers include putative precursors that initiate distal metastases . Although these cells are extraordinarily rare , they may identify cellular pathways contributing to the blood-borne dissemination of cancer . Here , we adapted a microfluidic device for efficient capture of CTCs from an endogenous mouse pancreatic cancer model and subjected CTCs to single-molecule RNA sequencing , identifying Wnt2 as a candidate gene enriched in CTCs . Expression of WNT2 in pancreatic cancer cells suppresses anoikis , enhances anchorage-independent sphere formation , and increases metastatic propensity in vivo . This effect is correlated with fibronectin upregulation and suppressed by inhibition of MAP3K7 ( also known as TAK1 ) kinase . In humans , formation of non-adherent tumour spheres by pancreatic cancer cells is associated with upregulation of multiple WNT genes , and pancreatic CTCs revealed enrichment for WNT signalling in 5 out of 11 cases . Thus , molecular analysis of CTCs may identify candidate therapeutic targets to prevent the distal spread of cancer .
Background . Over the past ten years oncological outcomes achieved by local excision techniques ( LETs ) as the sole treatment for early stages of rectal cancer ( ESRC ) have been often disappointing . The reasons for these poor results lie mostly in the high risk of the disease's diffusion to local-regional lymph nodes even in ESRC . Aims . This study aims to find the correct indications for LET in ESRC taking into consideration clinical-pathological features of tumours that may reduce the risk of lymph node metastasis to zero . Methods . Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of casistics of ESRC treated with total mesorectal excision with the aim of identifying risk factors for nodal involvement . Results . The risk of lymph node metastasis is higher in G >= 2 and T >= 2 tumours with lymphatic and/or vascular invasion . Other features which have not yet been sufficiently investigated include female gender , TSM stage >1 , presence of tumour budding and/or perineural invasion . Conclusions . Results comparable to radical surgery can be achieved by LET only in patients with T(1) N(0) G(1) tumours with low-risk histological features , whereas deeper or more aggressive tumours should be addressed by radical surgery ( RS ) .
Epigenetic deregulation of gene expression has a role in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer ( PCa ) . The histone methyltransferase MMSET/WHSC1 ( Multiple Myeloma SET domain ) is overexpressed in a number of metastatic tumors , but its mechanism of action has not been defined . In this work , we found that PCa cell lines expressed significantly higher levels of MMSET compared with immortalized , non-transformed prostate cells . Knockdown experiments showed that , in metastatic PCa cell lines , dimethylation of lysine 36 and trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 ( H3K36me2 and H3K27me3 , respectively ) depended on MMSET expression , whereas depletion of MMSET in benign prostatic cells did not affect chromatin modifications . Knockdown of MMSET in DU145 and PC-3 tumor cells decreased cell proliferation , colony formation in soft agar and strikingly diminished cell migration and invasion . Conversely , overexpression of MMSET in immortalized , non-transformed RWPE-1 cells promoted cell migration and invasion , accompanied by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . Among a panel of EMT-promoting genes analyzed , TWIST1 expression was strongly activated in response to MMSET . Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that MMSET binds to the TWIST1 locus and leads to an increase in H3K36me2 , suggesting a direct role of MMSET in the regulation of this gene . Depletion of TWIST1 in MMSET-overexpressing RWPE-1 cells blocked cell invasion and EMT , indicating that TWIST1 was a critical target of MMSET , responsible for the acquisition of an invasive phenotype . Collectively , these data suggest that MMSET has a role in PCa pathogenesis and progression through epigenetic regulation of metastasis-related genes .
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) in cancer cells is considered to be a prerequisite for acquiring invasive/migratory phenotype and subsequent metastasis . This study provides molecular evidence associated with the antimetastatic effect of black tea polyphenol extracts ( BTE ) , which contain polyphenols including gallic acid , gallocatechin , catechin , epigallocatechin-3-gallate , epicatechin-3-gallate , and theaflavin 3,3'-digallate , in an an oral squamous cell culture system by showing a nearly complete inhibition on the invasion ( p < 0.001 ) of SCC-4 cells via reduced activities of MMP-2 ( p < 0.001 ) and u-PA ( p < 0.001 ) . Immunoblot was performed to find that BTE could induce up-regulation of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and inhibit mesenchymal markers such as snail-1 and vimentin . BTE inhibited p-FAK and p-paxillin , indicating the anti-EMT effect of BTE in oral squamous cell carcinoma . BTE was evidenced by its inhibition of the tumor growth of SCC-4 cells via cancer cell xenografted nude mice mode . These results suggested that BTE could reduce invasion by reversing EMT in human oral cancer cells .
BACKGROUND To assess the potential mechanisms that may underlie increased local failure in triple negative ( TN ) breast cancers , an analysis was performed of the risk of residual carcinoma after lumpectomy with correlation to pathologic factors , including molecular phenotype . METHODS A review of pathologic specimens was performed for women with invasive breast cancer treated with lumpectomy followed by reexcision . Data were collected on age ; tumor size , grade , and nodal stage ; estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , and human endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( Her2 ) ; extensive intraductal component ; lymphovascular invasion ; margins ; and reexcision findings . Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate for associations between pathologic features of the lumpectomy specimen and reexcision findings . Molecular phenotypes were defined by conventionally used immunohistochemical pattern . RESULTS Data were collected on 369 patients with breast cancer . The median age was 57 years , median tumor size was 1.5 cm , 36% had positive margins , 32% had positive lymph nodes , 73.5% had the luminal A subtype , 9.5% had the luminal B subtype , 4.5% were Her2-enriched , and 12.5% were TN . Overall , 32% of patients had invasive cancer in their reexcision specimens , and 51% of those with the TN subtype had residual invasive disease on reexcision compared with 30% to 31% for other subtypes . On univariate analysis , age , tumor size , margin status , lymphovascular invasion , nodal status , and TN subtype were associated with elevated risk of residual invasive cancer . On multivariate analysis using a forward stepwise model , TN subtype maintained significance , with an odds ratio of 3.28 ( P = .002 ) . CONCLUSION TN subtype has a statistically significant association with an increased risk of residual tumor . This suggests the putative increase in the risk of local failure in TN patients may be related to increased residual tumor burden .
Objective . The present study was performed to investigate the effect of N-desulfated heparin on basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) expression , tumor angiogenesis and metastasis of gastric carcinoma . Methods . Human gastric cancer SGC-7901 tissues were orthotopically implanted into the stomach of NOD SCID mice . Twenty mice were randomly divided into two groups which received either intravenous injection of 0.9% NaCl solution ( normal saline group ) or 10 mg/kg N-desulfated heparin ( N-desulfated heparin group ) twice weekly for three weeks . In vitro , human gastric carcinoma SGC-7901 cells were treated with N-desulfated heparin in different concentration ( 0.1 mg/mL , 1 mg/mL , N-desulfated heparin group ) , and treated with medium ( control group ) . Results . In vivo , the tumor metastasis rates were 9/10 in normal saline group and 2/10 in N-desulfated heparin group ( P < 0.05 ) . The intratumoral microvessel density was higher in normal saline group than in N-desulfated heparin group ( P < 0.05). bFGF expression in gastric tissue was inhibited by N-desulfated heparin ( P < 0.05 ) . There was no bleeding in N-desulfated heparin group . In vitro , N-desulfated heparin inhibited significantly bFGF protein and mRNA expression of gastric carcinoma cells ( P < 0.05 ) . Conclusions . N-desulfated heparin can inhibit the metastasis of gastric cancer through inhibiting tumor bFGF expression and tumor angiogenesis with no obvious anticoagulant activity .
The aberrant activation of sonic hedgehog ( SHH ) pathway contributes to initiation and progression of various malignancies . However , the roles and underlying mechanisms of SHH signaling pathway in invasion and metastasis of liver cancer have not been well understood . In this study , we found that SHH signaling was activated and correlated with invasion and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . Enhanced SHH signaling by recombinant human SHH N-terminal peptide ( rSHH-N ) promoted hepatoma cell adhesion , migration and invasion , whereas blockade of SHH signaling with SHH neutralizing antibody or cyclopamine suppressed hepatoma cell adhesion , migration and invasion . Furthermore , matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expressions and activities were upregulated and downregulated by rSHH-N and SHH signaling inhibitor , respectively . The rSHH-N-mediated hepatoma cell migration and invasion was blocked by MMP-specific inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies to MMP-2 and MMP-9 . In addition , phosphorylations of AKT and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) were increased and decreased by rSHH-N and SHH signaling inhibitor , respectively . Further investigations showed that activation of AKT and FAK were required for rSHH-N-mediated upregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 , cell migration and invasion . Finally , we found that SHH protein expression was positively correlated with phosphorylatd FAK Tyr397 , phosphorylatd AKT Ser473 , MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein expressions in HCC samples . Taken together , our findings suggest that SHH pathway induces cell migration and invasion through FAK/AKT signaling-mediated MMP-2 and MMP-9 production and activation in liver cancer .
Anal canal cancer is a rare tumor without clear treatment evidence in the metastatic setting . In terms of the bad prognosis of patients with metastatic anal cancer , further therapeutic options are urgently needed . In this paper we present the case of a 64-year-old man suffering from undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma with liver metastases . After progression on cisplatin and fluorouracil , tumor tissue was analyzed with respect to anti-EGFR therapy with cetuximab . There was no KRAS mutation and the EGFR expression level in the tumor tissue was 2+ ; ideal conditions for the immunotherapy . Encouraged by these results we started a therapy using FOLFIRI in combination with cetuximab . Fortunately the patient showed a partial response after 6 cycles . On patient's preference we did a therapy break of 6 weeks . Within this time period the disease was progressive indicating its aggressiveness . However , the same immunotherapy was able to stabilize the disease for a further 3 months . The patient died 21 months after diagnosis because of liver failure . Nevertheless , from our perspective the combination of FOLFIRI and cetuximab is quite a promising therapeutic option for patients with metastatic anal cancer . Potential predictive factors of the immunochemotherapy are discussed in this paper .
Background . An important goal of personalized cancer therapy is to tailor specific therapies to the mutational profile of individual patients . However , whole genome sequencing studies have shown that the mutational profiles of cancers evolve over time and often differ between primary and metastatic sites . Activating point mutations in the PIK3CA gene are common in primary breast cancer tumors , but their presence in breast cancer bone metastases has not been assessed previously . Results . Fourteen patients with breast cancer bone metastases were biopsied by three methods : CT-guided bone biopsies ; bone marrow trephine biopsies ; and bone marrow aspiration . Samples that were positive for cancer cells were obtained from six patients . Three of these patients had detectable PIK3CA mutations in bone marrow cancer cells . Primary tumor samples were available for four of the six patients assessed for PIK3CA status in their bone metastases . For each of these , the PIK3CA mutation status was the same in the primary and metastatic sites . Conclusions . PIK3CA mutations occur frequently in breast cancer bone metastases . The PIK3CA mutation status in bone metastases samples appears to reflect the PIK3CA mutation status in the primary tumour . Breast cancer patients with bone metastases may be candidates for treatment with selective PIK3CA inhibitors .
OBJECTIVES Human neutrophil proteins-1 , -2 , and -3 ( HNPs -1 , -2 , and -3 ) are expressed in several tumor types . However , the role of HNPs 1-3 in human bladder cancer has not yet been determined . We investigated the association between the plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 and clinicopathological parameters in bladder cancer patients . DESIGN AND METHODS The plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 were measured in 60 patients with bladder cancer and in 58 healthy controls . The plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 were determined by a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Plasma samples were obtained before surgery . Plasma samples were permitted to clot and were then stored at -80 <FFFD>C until use . RESULTS The levels of the HNPs increased from grade 1 to 4 tumors and this difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) . Additionally , plasma HNP levels were significantly higher in patients with metastatic bladder cancer and in patients with lymphovascular involvement , metastasis of the lymph nodes , and increased tumor burden ( p < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS The preoperative plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 paralleled the progression and pathological stages of the malignancies . This study suggests that HNPs 1-3 promote tumor invasion and are potential indicators of disease progression in patients with bladder cancer .
Chronic inflammation is a critical component in breast cancer progression . Pro-inflammatory mediators along with growth/survival factors within the tumor microenvironment potentiate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha ) , chemotactic cytokines and their receptors ( CXCR4 , CXCL12 , CXCL8 ) and angiogenic factors ( VEGF ) that often overcome the effect of anti-inflammatory molecules ( IL-4 , IL-10 ) thus evading the host's antitumor immunity . Detailed knowledge , therefore , of the regulatory mechanisms determining cytokine levels is essential to understand the pathogenesis of breast cancer . HIF-1alpha and NF-kappaB transcription factors are important players for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory and potentially oncogenic environment . HIF-1alpha is the key mediator of the cellular response to oxygen deprivation and induces the expression of genes involved in survival and angiogenesis within solid hypoxic tumors . The expression of these genes is often modulated by the p53 tumor suppressor protein that induces apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in neoplastic cells . Functional crosstalk between HIF-1alpha and p53 pathways mediated by modulators shared between the two transcription factors such as SRC-1 and SIRT-1 differentially regulate the expression of distinct subsets of their target genes under variable stress conditions . In an attempt to shed light on the complex regulatory mechanisms involved in cancer-related inflammation , we investigated the role of the two common p53 and HIF-1alpha co-regulators SRC-1 and SIRT-1 , in the expression of the highly potent metastatic chemokine receptor CXCR4 . Both SRC-1 and SIRT-1 overexpression in DSFX-treated MCF-7 cells reduced CXCR4 cellular levels implying that both co-regulators are crucial factors in the determination of the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells .
This study intended to investigate the expression of the ZEB1 and E-cadherin proteins in lung squamous cell carcinoma ( LSCC ) tissues and to examine the clinicopathological correlation between protein levels and LSCC . RT-PCR and Western blot were used to examine the expression of ZEB1 and E-cadherin mRNAs and proteins in LSCC tissues as well as in adjacent normal tissues , and then analyze the relationship between the clinicopathological characteristics and the expression changes of ZEB1 and E-cadherin mRNAs in LSCC . In addition , RNAi was used to knockdown the expression of the ZEB1 gene in Human HCC827 cells ; subsequently , changes in the invasive ability of the resultant cells were studied . The positive rates of ZEB1 and E-cadherin mRNAs in LSCC tissues were 69.2 and 38.5% , respectively . They differed significantly from the corresponding positive rates in the adjacent normal lung tissues ( 15.4 and 80.8% , p<0.05 ) . There was a negative correlation between the protein levels of ZEB1 and E-cadherin in LSCC tissues ( r=-0.714 , p<0.001 ) ; in addition , it was found that ZEB1 protein expression in LSCC tissues was significantly higher than that in the neighboring normal lung tissues ( p<0.05 ) , and its expression was also significantly higher in patients with lymph node metastases and distant metastases compared to those patients without metastatic disease ( p<0.05 ) . On the contrary , E-cadherin expression was significantly lower in LSCC tissues than that in the neighboring normal tissue ( p<0.05 ) . It was lower in patients with lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis compared to patients without metastatic disease ( p<0.05 ) . However , the expression of ZEB1 and E-cadherin was independent of gender , age , tumor size , or tumor differentiation level ( p>0.05 ) . Transfection of ZEB1 siRNA into HCC827 cells significantly reduced the ZEB1 protein level ( p<0.01 ) and significantly elevated E-cadherin levels ( p<0.01 ) . Moreover , significantly less ZEB1 siRNA-transfected cells migrated through Transwell chambers in the LSCC tissue than that in the control groups ( untransfected or transfected with control siRNA , p<0.01 ) . The expression of the ZEB1 gene in LSCC tissues is downregulated with the expression of E-cadherin . On the other hand , the expression of siRNA against ZEB1 promotes E-cadherin expression and suppresses the invasive ability conferred by E-cadherin . In conclusion , our data suggested that overexpression of the ZEB1 gene is possibly associated with the occurrence , development , invasion of LSCC .
This study examined the possible role of p120ctn in the pathogenesis and development of pancreatic cancer . PANC-1 cells , a kind of human pancreatic carcinoma cell line , were cultured in this study. p120ctn was immunocytochemically detected in PANC-1 cells . The recombinant lentivirus vector was constructed to knock down the p120ctn expression of PANC-1 cells . Real-time quantitative PCR ( RQ-PCR ) and Western blotting were used to determine the expression of p120ctn and E-cadherin in PANC-1 cells after p120ctn knockdown . The adhesion , invasion and migration capacity of PANC-1 cells after p120ctn knockdown was detected by cell adhesion , invasion and migration assays . Cell growth was measured by the MTT method . Cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting . The results showed that p120ctn knockdown led to significantly down-regulated E-cadherin and a reduced cell-to-cell adhesion ability in PANC-1 cells. shRNA-mediated knockdown of p120ctn reduced invasion and migration capacity of PANC-1 cells , inhibited cell growth , caused a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in G(1) , an increase in S , and promoted apoptosis of PANC-1 cells . It was concluded that p120ctn plays a pivotal role in the proliferation and metastasis of pancreatic carcinoma , suggesting that p120ctn is a novel target for pancreatic carcinoma treatment .
Inorganic arsenic in the drinking water is a multisite human carcinogen that potentially targets the kidney . Recent evidence also indicates that developmental arsenic exposure impacts renal carcinogenesis in humans and mice . Emerging theory indicates that cancer may be a disease of stem cells ( SCs ) and that there are abundant active SCs during early life . Therefore , we hypothesized that inorganic arsenic targets SCs , or partially differentiated progenitor cells ( PCs ) , for oncogenic transformation . Thus , a rat kidney SC/PC cell line , RIMM-18 , was chronically exposed to low-level arsenite ( 500 nM ) for up to 28 weeks . Multiple markers of acquired cancer phenotype were assessed biweekly during arsenic exposure , including secreted matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activity , proliferation rate , colony formation in soft agar , and cellular invasiveness . Arsenic exposure by 10 weeks and after also induced marked and sustained increases in colony formation , indicative of the loss of contact inhibition , and increased invasiveness , both cancer cell characteristics . Compared to the passage-matched control , chronic arsenic exposure caused exposure-duration dependent increases in secreted MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity , Cox-2 expression , and more rapid proliferation ( all >2-fold ) , characteristics typical of cancer cells . Dysregulation of SC maintenance genes and signaling pathways are common during oncogenesis . During arsenite exposure , expression of several genes associated with normal kidney development and SC regulation and differentiation ( i.e. , Wt-1 , Wnt-4 , Bmp-7 , etc. ) were aberrantly altered . Arsenic-exposed renal SCs produced more nonadherent spheroid bodies that grew much more aggressively in Matrigel , typical of cancer SCs ( CSCs ) . The transformed cells also showed gene overexpression typical of renal SCs/CSCs ( CD24 , Osr1 , Ncam ) and arsenic adaptation such as overexpression of Mt-1 , Mt2 , Sod-1 , and Abcc2 . These data suggest that inorganic arsenic induced an acquired cancer phenotype in vitro in these rat kidney SCs potentially forming CSCs and , consistent with data in vivo , indicate that these multipotent SCs may be targets of arsenic during renal carcinogenesis .
Olfactomedin 4 ( OLFM4 ) is highly expressed in gastrointestinal cancers and has an anti-apoptotic function . The roles of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis and how it functions in these processes remain elusive . We investigated the function of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis using B16F10 mouse melanoma cells as an experimental system . Our results showed that OLFM4 had no positive effect on cell viability or cell cycle progression in B16F10 cells . However , it significantly suppressed the tumorigenicity of B16F10 cells , i.e. , intradermal primary tumor growth and lung metastasis . OLFM4 also suppressed the migration and invasion of B16F10 cells in vitro . For further insight into the mechanisms underlying OLFM4-mediated suppression of tumor progression , we examined the effect of OLFM4 on the expression of integrin and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) , both of which are involved in tumor progression . Overexpression of OLFM4 clearly reduced the expression levels of integrin alpha1 , integrin alpha4 , integrin alpha5 , integrin alpha6 , and MMP9 . Moreover , forced expression of MMP9 attenuated the inhibitory activity of OLFM4 on migration and invasiveness . Our findings provide the experimental evidence that OLFM4 may function as a tumor suppressor and an anti-metastatic gene during tumor progression .
Invasion and metastasis are the major causes of cancer-related death . Pharmacological or therapeutic interventions such as chemoprevention of the progression stages of neoplastic development could result in substantial reduction in the incidence of cancer mortality . ( -)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG ) , a promising chemopreventive agent , has attracted extensive interest for cancer therapy utilizing its antioxidant , anti- proliferative and inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion . In this study , we assessed the influence of EGCG on the proliferative potential of HeLa cells by cell viability assay and authenticated the results by nuclear morphological examination , DNA laddering assay and cell cycle analysis . Further we analyzed the anti-invasive properties of EGCG by wound migration assay and gene expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in HeLa cells . Our results indicated that EGCG induced growth inhibition of HeLa cells in a dose- and time- dependent manner . It was observed that cell death mediated by EGCG was through apoptosis . Interestingly , EGCG effectively inhibited invasion and migration of HeLa cells and modulated the expression of related genes ( MMP-9 and TIMP-1 ) . These results indicate that EGCG may effectively suppress promotion and progression stages of cervical cancer development .
The functions of Rap-1A in oral carcinogenesis are largely unexplored . In this study , we examined the expression of Rap-1A at different malignant stages of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma ( OCSCC ) . Semiquantitative RT-PCR , quantitative RT-PCR , and Western blotting were used to evaluate Rap-1A mRNA and protein expressions , respectively , in paired OCSCC patient specimens . To determine the possible correlation between Rap-1A expression and various clinical characteristics , 256 samples from patients with OCSCC were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining . Strong Rap-1A expression was a significant prognostic marker and predictor of aggressive OCSCC . The overall and disease-specific 5-year survival rates were significantly correlated with strong expression of Rap-1A ( P < 0.001 ) . Functionally , overexpressed Rap-1A could promote oral cancer cell migration and invasion by Transwell chambers and wound healing assay . Conversely , the suppression of Rap-1A expression using Rap-1A-mediated siRNA was sufficient to decrease cell motility . Furthermore , our data also illustrated that Aurora-A could not only induce mRNA and protein expressions of Rap-1A for enhancing cancer cell motility but also co-localize and form a complex with Rap-1A in the oral cancer cell line . Finally , immunohistochemical staining , indirect immunofluorescence , and Western blotting analysis of human aggressive OCSCC specimens revealed a significantly positive correlation between Rap-1A and Aurora-A expression . Taken together , our results suggest that the Aurora-A/Rap-1A pathway is associated with survival , tumor progression , and metastasis of OCSCC patients .
Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 ( CTHRC1 ) is a secreted protein involved in vascular remodeling , bone formation and developmental morphogenesis . CTHRC1 has recently been shown to be expressed in human cancers such as breast cancer and melanoma . In this study , we show that CTHRC1 is highly expressed in human pancreatic cancer tissues and plays a role in the progression and metastasis of the disease . CTHRC1 promoted primary tumor growth and metastatic spread of cancer cells to distant organs in orthotopic xenograft tumor mouse models . Overexpression of CTHRC1 in cancer cells resulted in increased motility and adhesiveness , whereas these cellular activities were diminished by down-regulation of the protein . CTHRC1 activated several key signaling molecules , including Src , focal adhesion kinase , paxillin , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) , extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Rac1 . Treatment with chemical inhibitors of Src , MEK or Rac1 and expression of dominant-negative Rac1 attenuated CTHRC1-induced cell migration and adhesion . Collectively , our results suggest that CTHRC1 has a role in pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis by regulating migration and adhesion activities of cancer cells .
Heparanase is a mammalian endoglycosidase that degrades heparan sulfate at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix . The expression of heparanase was detected in a wide variety of human malignant tumors and closely associated with tumor invasion , metastasis , and angiogenesis . However , the specific roles of heparanase and its mechanisms of regulating the malignant potential of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells still remain unclear . In the present study , the expression of heparanase was down-regulated in NSCLC cell line by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide . Results showed that down-regulation of heparanase led to significant inhibition of invasive and proliferative potentials of A549 cells in vitro and in vivo . Further research demonstrated that down-regulation of heparanase significantly inhibited the angiogenic potential of A549 cells , which might be the mechanism responsible for the inhibition of A549 cell proliferation in BALB/c nude mice in vivo . These findings demonstrate that heparanase plays essential roles in regulating the invasion , proliferation , and angiogenesis of A549 cells .
Inflammation is a major risk factor for carcinogenesis in patients affected by chronic colitis , yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression from chronic inflammation to cancer are not completely understood . Activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4)-NFkappaB signaling axis is associated with inflammation . Thus , we hypothesized that inhibition of TLR4-NFkappaB signaling might help in limiting inflammatory responses and inflammation-induced oncogenesis . In this work , we studied the effects of a TLR4-interacting surfactant protein A-derived ( SPA4 ) peptide on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)-induced TLR4-NFkappaB signaling and cancer progression . We first characterized this peptide for its ability to bind the TLR4 ligand-LPS and for physico-chemical characteristics . Inflammation was induced by challenging the colon cancer SW480 cells with Escherichia coli LPS . Cells were then treated with varying amounts of the SPA4 peptide . Changes in the expression of TLR4 , interleukin ( IL)-1beta and IL-6 , in intracellular NFkappaB-related signal transducers ( IKBalpha , p65 , phosphorylated IKBalpha , phosphorylated p65 , RelB , COX-2 ) as well as in the transcriptional activity of NFkappaB were studied by immunocytochemistry , immunoblotting and NFkappaB reporter assay , respectively . Simultaneously , the effects on LPS-induced cell migration and invasion were determined . We found that the SPA4 peptide does not bind to LPS . Rather , its binding to TLR4 inhibits the LPS-induced phosphorylation of p65 , production of IL-1beta and IL-6 , activity of NFkappaB , migration and invasion of SW480 cells . In conclusion , our results suggest that the inhibition of TLR4-NFkappaB signaling by a TLR4-binding peptide may help for the treatment of chronic inflammation and prevention of inflammation-induced cancer in patients with colitis .
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are involved in cancer development and progression , acting as tumor suppressors or oncogenes . In this study , miRNA profiling was performed on 10 paired bladder cancer ( BC ) tissues using 20 GeneChipTM miRNA Array , and 10 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in BC and adjacent noncancerous tissues of any disease stage/grade . After validated on expanded cohort of 67 paired BC tissues and 10 human BC cell lines by qRT-PCR , it was found that miR-100 was down-regulated most significantly in cancer tissues . Ectopic restoration of miR-100 expression in BC cells suppressed cell proliferation and motility , induced cell-cycle arrest in vitro , and inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo both in subcutaneous and intravesical passage . Bioinformatic analysis showed that mTOR gene was a direct target of miR-100. siRNA-mediated mTOR knockdown phenocopied the effect of miR-100 in BC cell lines . In addition , the cancerous metastatic nude mouse model established on the basis of primary BC cell lines suggested that miR-100/mTOR regulated cell motility and was associated with tumor metastasis . Both mTOR and p70S6K ( downstream messenger ) presented higher expression levels in distant metastatic foci such as in liver and kidney metastases than in primary tumor . Taken together , miR-100 may act as a tumor suppressor in BC , and reintroduction of this mature miRNA into tumor tissue may prove to be a therapeutic strategy by reducing the expression of target genes .
Nectin-like molucule-5 ( Necl-5 ) is an immunoglobulin-like molecule that was originally identified as a poliovirus receptor and is often upregulated in cancer cells . It has been said that Necl-5 plays a role in not only cell-cell adhesion , but also cell migration , proliferation , and metastasis . In this study , we used a bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ( BAC ) cell line and fibroblasts to assess the expression of Necl-5 in the development of cancer-stroma communication by using an easy-to-prepare double-layered collagen gel hemisphere ( DL- CGH ) system that enables visualization of cell migration during invasion . The expression of Necl-5 was higher in BAC cells than in fibroblasts . This tendency didn't change even when the BAC cells were mixed with fibroblasts . To assess the role of Necl-5 in the invasive activity of the BAC cells , we knocked down its expression using RNA interference ( RNAi ) . The invasion assay with DL-CGH revealed that inhibitation of Necl-5 expression in the BAC cells was associated with suppressed invasiveness . In addition , Necl-5 knockdown inhibited the movement and proliferation of the BAC cells . Necl-5 expression in lung cancer cells is crucial for their invasiveness in the cancer-stromal interaction , suggesting that Necl-5 could be a favorable molecular target for the suppression of invasiveness in lung adenocarcinoma .
The ALKBH family of proteins are highly expressed in various types of human cancer where they are involved in tumor growth and progression . However , multiple isoforms of ALKBH exist and the effect of individual isoforms on the development of urinary bladder cancer is unknown , particularly the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression from a noninvasive to invasive phenotype . We examined the role and function of ALKBH2 in human bladder cancer development in vitro and provide the first report that suppression of ALKBH2 in a human urothelial carcinoma cell line , KU7 , reduced the expression of the transmembrane mucin protein , MUC1 , and induced G1 cell cycle arrest . Moreover , reduction of ALKBH2 suppressed epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) via increasing E-cadherin and decreasing vimentin expression . Transfection of MUC1 siRNA inhibited cell proliferation and EMT to the same extent as ALKBH2 gene silencing in vitro . ALKBH2 knockdown significantly suppressed MUC1 expression and tumor volume of bladder cancers in vivo as assessed in an orthotopic mouse model using ALKBH2 shRNA transfected KU7 cells . Immunohistochemical examination showed high expression levels of ALKBH2 in human urothelial carcinoma samples , especially in high-grade , superficially and deeply invasive carcinomas ( pT(1) and >pT(2) ) , and in carcinoma in situ but not in normal urothelium . This study demonstrates that ALKBH2 is an upstream molecule of the oncoprotein , MUC1 , and regulates cell cycle and EMT , resulting in progression of urothelial carcinomas .
The new concept of keeping primary tumor under control in situ to suppress distant foci sheds light on the novel treatment of metastatic tumor . Hyperthermia is considered as one of the means for controlling tumor growth . In this study , a novel thermal modality was built to introduce hyperthermia effect on tumor to suppress its growth and progression using 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma , a common animal model of metastatic breast cancer . A mildly raised temperature ( i.e.39<FFFD>C ) was imposed on the skin surface of the implanted tumor using a thermal heating pad . Periodic heating ( 12 hours per day ) was carried out for 3 days , 7 days , 14 days , and 21 days , respectively . The tumor growth rate was found significantly decreased in comparison to the control without hyperthermia . Biological evidences associated with tumor angiogenesis and metastasis were examined using histological analyses . Accordingly , the effect of mild hyperthermia on immune cell infiltration into tumors was also investigated . It was demonstrated that a delayed tumor growth and malignancy progression was achieved by mediating tumor cell apoptosis , vascular injury , degrading metastasis potential and as well as inhibiting the immunosuppressive cell myeloid derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) recruitment . Further mechanistic studies will be performed to explore the quantitative relationship between tumor progression and thermal dose in the near future .
Metastases in the sellar region are rare and are frequently found incidentally or in necropsies . Only 7% are reported to be symptomatic . Diabetes insipidus , anterior pituitary dysfunction , visual field defects , headache/pain and ophthalmoplegia are the most commonly reported symptoms . We present the cases of two male patients with a small-cell lung carcinoma whose first clinical symptoms were due to pituitary metastasis . One case presented with symptoms of cavernous sinus invasion and panhypopituitarism and the other case with diabetes insipidus . Both patients had a rapid progression of their disease despite chemotherapy and died after a few months . Pituitary metastases occur most commonly with breast cancer in women and lung cancer in men . The presence of polyuria and polydipsia in an oncologic patient should alert the physician for diabetes insipidus and , if confirmed , an imaging procedure of the pituitary gland is mandatory . Treatment for these tumors is often multimodal and includes surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy and hormone replacement . Although surgical series have not shown any significant survival benefits given by tumor resection , the patient's quality of life may be improved .
Metastasis is the most lethal attribute of human malignancy . High-level expression of survivin is involved in both carcinogenesis and angiogenesis in cancer . Previous studies indicate that a mutation of the threonine residue at position 34 ( Thr34Ala ) of survivin generates a dominant-negative mutant that induces apoptosis , inhibits angiogenesis , and suppresses highly metastatic breast carcinoma in mouse models . We investigated the efficacy of gene therapy with a survivin dominant-negative mutant and possible factors related to lymph node metastasis . The metastasis rate was compared between each group in order to find a survivin-targeted therapy against lymphangiogenesis in its earliest stages . We established lymph node metastasis models and treated animals with H22 tumors with Lip-mSurvivinT34A ( Lip-mS ) , Lip-plasmid ( Lip-P ) , or normal saline ( NS ) . Eight days after the last dose , five randomly chosen mice from each group were sacrificed . We detected the apoptotic index , microvessel density ( MVD ) , lymphatic microvessel density ( LMVD ) , and the expression of VEGF-D with immunohistochemistry . After the remaining animals were sacrificed , we compared the tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes in each group . Administration of mSurvivinT34A plasmid complexed with cationic liposome ( DOTAP/chol ) resulted in the efficacious inhibition of tumor growth and lymph node metastasis within the mouse H22 tumor model . These responses were associated with tumor cell apoptosis , and angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis inhibition . Our results suggested that Lip-mSurvivinT34A induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis , thus suppressing tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis . The mSurvivinT34A survivin mutant is a promising strategy of gene therapy to inhibit lymphatic metastasis .
Metastatic breast tumors undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , which renders them resistant to therapies targeted to the primary cancers . The mechanistic link between mtDNA ( mitochondrial DNA ) reduction , often seen in breast cancer patients , and EMT is unknown . We demonstrate that reducing mtDNA content in human mammary epithelial cells ( hMECs ) activates Calcineurin ( Cn)-dependent mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway , which induces EMT-like reprogramming to fibroblastic morphology , loss of cell polarity , contact inhibition and acquired migratory and invasive phenotype . Notably , mtDNA reduction generates breast cancer stem cells . In addition to retrograde signaling markers , there is an induction of mesenchymal genes but loss of epithelial markers in these cells . The changes are reversed by either restoring the mtDNA content or knockdown of CnAalpha mRNA , indicating the causal role of retrograde signaling in EMT . Our results point to a new therapeutic strategy for metastatic breast cancers targeted to the mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway for abrogating EMT and attenuating cancer stem cells , which evade conventional therapies . We report a novel regulatory mechanism by which low mtDNA content generates EMT and cancer stem cells in hMECs.Oncogene advance online publication , 4 November 2013 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.467 .
RAD51 is a key enzyme of homologous recombination and repair of DNA double-strand breaks . RAD51 mRNA expression levels are significantly increased in laser-microdissected mammary simple carcinomas and their lymph node metastases when compared to adenomas or nonneoplastic mammary gland of the same dog . Here , RAD51 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded mammary carcinomas and their lymph node metastases of 40 dogs , adenomas of 48 dogs , and nonneoplastic mammary gland of 88 dogs . Number of cells with nuclear RAD51 expression was significantly ( P < or = .05 ) increased in carcinomas when compared to adenomas and metastases . In contrast , no significant differences in the number of RAD51-expressing cells were detected when metastases were compared with adenomas and nonneoplastic gland . RAD51 expression in carcinomas was correlated with expression in metastases but not with histologic grade . In conclusion , the increased number of RAD51-expressing cells in carcinomas might indicate genomic instability in these cells . Nevertheless , the increased RAD51 mRNA expression in metastases could not be confirmed by immunohistochemistry .
