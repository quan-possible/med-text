Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , also known as vascular permeability factor or vasculotropin , is a recently characterized endothelial-specific mitogen which is angiogenic in vivo . Here we demonstrate that VEGF is angiogenic in vitro : when added to microvascular endothelial cells grown on the surface of three-dimensional collagen gels , VEGF induces the cells to invade the underlying matrix and to form capillary-like tubules , with an optimal effect at approximately 2.2nM ( 100ng/ml ) . When compared to basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) at equimolar ( 0.5nM ) concentrations , VEGF was about half as potent . The most striking effect was seen in combination with bFGF : when added simultaneously , VEGF and bFGF induced an in vitro angiogenic response which was far greater than additive , and which occurred with greater rapidity than the response to either cytokine alone . These results demonstrate that like bFGF , VEGF induces an angiogenic response via a direct effect on endothelial cells , and that by acting in concert , these two cytokines have a potent synergistic effect on the induction of angiogenesis in vitro . We suggest that the synergism between VEGF and bFGF plays an important role in the control of angiogenesis in vivo .
We have modelled multiple stages of malignant transformation of human endothelial cells ( ECs ) by overexpressing the catalytic subunit of human telomerase ( hTERT ) , together with SV40 T antigen ( SV40T ) and oncogenic N-ras . Transfection with hTERT alone , led to the immortalization of two out of three cultures of bone marrow-derived ECs ( BMECs ) . One hTERT transduced BMEC culture underwent a long proliferative lag before resuming proliferation . BMECs transfected with hTERT alone were functionally and phenotypically normal . BMECs transfected with SV40T ( BMSVTs ) had an extended lifespan , but eventually succumbed to crisis . BMSVTs exhibited a partially transformed phenotype , demonstrating growth factor independence , altered antigen expression and forming tiny , infrequent colonies in vitro . Transduction of BMSVTs with hTERT resulted in immortalization of 4 out of 4 cultures . BMSVTs immortalized with hTERT formed large colonies in vitro and small transient tumours in vivo . BMECs co-expressing SV40T , hTERT and N-ras exhibited an overtly transformed phenotype ; forming very large colonies with an altered morphology and generating rapidly growing tumours in vivo . These investigations demonstrate transformation of human ECs to an overtly malignant phenotype . This model will be useful for understanding mechanisms underlying vascular and angiogenic neoplasias , as well as for testing drugs designed to curtail aberrant EC growth .
Tumor cells are elusive targets for immunotherapy due to their heterogeneity and genetic instability . Here we describe a novel , oral DNA vaccine that targets stable , proliferating endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature rather than tumor cells . Targeting occurs through upregulated vascular-endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( FLK-1 ) of proliferating endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature . This vaccine effectively protected mice from lethal challenges with melanoma , colon carcinoma and lung carcinoma cells and reduced growth of established metastases in a therapeutic setting . CTL-mediated killing of endothelial cells indicated breaking of peripheral immune tolerance against this self antigen , resulting in markedly reduced dissemination of spontaneous and experimental pulmonary metastases . Angiogenesis in the tumor vasculature was suppressed without impairment of fertility , neuromuscular performance or hematopoiesis , albeit with a slight delay in wound healing . Our strategy circumvents problems in targeting of genetically unstable tumor cells . This approach may provide a new strategy for the rational design of cancer therapies .
Neuroblastoma ( NB ) , a common pediatric neoplasm , consists of two main cell populations : neuroblastic/ganglionic cells and Schwann cells . NB tumors with abundant Schwannian stroma display a more benign clinical behavior than stroma-poor tumors . Recent studies suggest that Schwann cells influence NB tumor growth via secreted factors that induce differentiation , suppress proliferation , and inhibit angiogenesis . Two angiogenesis inhibitors , pigment epithelium-derived factor and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 , have been detected in Schwann cell secretions . Here , we isolated another Schwann cell-derived secreted inhibitor of angiogenesis , a 43-kDa protein identified as SPARC ( secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine ) , an extracellular matrix protein . We found SPARC to be critical for the antiangiogenic phenotype of cultured Schwann cells . We also show that purified SPARC potently inhibits angiogenesis and significantly impairs NB tumor growth in vivo . SPARC may be an effective candidate for the treatment of children with clinically aggressive , Schwannian stroma-poor NB tumors .
Recent studies have shown that the transcription factor , nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) , regulates critical survival pathways in a variety of different cell types , including human pancreatic cancer cells . The activation of NF-kappaB is controlled by proteasome-mediated degradation of its endogenous polypeptide inhibitor , inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaBalpha . We investigated the effects of PS-341 , a peptide boronate inhibitor of the proteasome in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo . Comparison of PS-341's effects on the growth of eight different human pancreatic cancer cell lines revealed marked heterogeneity in drug responsiveness , ranging from highly resistant ( IC50 > 10 microM ; Panc-48 , HS766T , and Mia-PaCa-2 ) to extremely sensitive ( IC50 < 40 nM ; L3.6pl , Hpaf2 , and BxPC3 ) . However , these effects did not correlate with differential inhibition of NF-kappaB activation . Direct quantification of apoptosis revealed that PS-341's effects on cell growth largely correlated with sensitivity to programmed cell death . Evaluation of PS-341's effects on established orthotopic tumor xenografts demonstrated that biweekly intravenous administration of the maximum-tolerated dose of the drug ( 1 mg/kg ) led to significant reductions in the volumes of L3.6pl tumors but not Mia-PaCa-2 tumors . Laser scanning cytometer-mediated quantification of drug-induced apoptosis in the xenografts confirmed that PS-341 induced DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase-3 in L3.6pl tumors but not in Mia-PaCa-2 tumors . However , histological examination of drug-treated tumors revealed extensive central necrosis and reductions in microvessel density and VEGF expression in both tumor types . Taken together , our results demonstrate that PS-341 inhibits the growth of human pancreatic tumors via direct effects on tumor cells and indirect effects on the tumor vasculature .
The triterpenoid fraction ( 100 and 200 mg/kg ) of the fruit bodies of Ganoderma lucidum inhibited primary solid-tumor growth in the spleen , liver metastasis and secondary metastatic tumor growth in the liver in intrasplenic Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC)-implanted mice . In addition , the triterpenoid fraction ( 800 micrograms/mL ) inhibited angiogenesis induced by Matrigel ( a soluble basement membrane extract of the Engelbreth-Holm-Swam ( EHS ) tumor ) supplemented with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and heparin in an in vivo model . This suggested that the antitumor and antimetastatic activities of the triterpenoid fraction of G. lucidum might be due to the inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis . Next , we attempted to isolate the active substance(s) using the in vivo assay system of Matrigel-induced angiogenesis . The acidic fraction of the triterpenoid fraction inhibited the Matrigel-induced angiogenesis . Compound I was isolated from the acidic fraction as an active substance that inhibited the Martigel-induced angiogenesis . Compound I was identified as ganoderic acid F based on the data of IR , 1H- and 13C-NMR and MS analyses .
Mast cells ( MC ) are critical for a number of pathological conditions , including acute and chronic inflammation and tumor angiogenesis . We have previously demonstrated that in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ( B-NHL ) angiogenesis is correlated with total methachromatic and tryptase-positive MC and that both counts increase in step with the increase in malignancy , whereas the role of MC in malignant lymph nodes is not fully clear . An extensive ultrastructural study has been made of representative samples of 30 B-NHL and 10 benign lymphadenopathies . A heterogeneous population of MC characterized by the presence of granules with a semilunar aspect and containing scrolls was observed . The former are the expression of a slow but progressive release of angiogenic factors due to chronic , progressive stimulation of MC degranulation , while the latter contain tryptase , an angiogenic factor . These two ultrastructural data confirm the important role played by MC in the angiogenesis associated with progression in B-NHL .
Angiogenesis is increased in hematologic malignancies , including non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . Elevated serum levels of two important angiogenic factors , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , are associated with a poor prognosis . Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate 27 patients with NHL and bone marrow involvement ( 17 with low-grade B-cell NHL , including 7 with higher grade transformation ; 6 with intermediate-grade B-cell NHL ; and 4 with T-cell lymphoma ) . Among the 17 patients with low-grade B-cell NHL , results for 7 were positive for VEGF stain ( 41.2% ) , and results were negative for all other stains for VEGF receptors , bFGF , and bFGF receptors . In the 10 patients with intermediate-grade B-cell NHL and T-cell lymphoma , all VEGF staining was positive ( 100% ) , but bFGF staining was only weakly positive in 2 . Staining results for seven patients who had low-grade B-cell NHL with higher grade transformation showed that VEGF staining was positive in large lymphoid cells of 5 patients and in small lymphoid cells of one patient . Staining for the receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 was positive in large lymphoid cells in four and two cases , respectively . Staining for bFGF was positive in two cases of large lymphoid cells . We concluded that VEGF , but not bFGF , was associated with higher tumor grading of NHL and high-grade transformation of low-grade lymphoma .
Expression of angiogenic factors is upregulated in hyperplastic mucosa adjacent to colon cancer , and this upregulation is closely associated with cancer growth and metastasis . We investigated the role of histone acetylation in vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) expression in hyperplastic mucosa adjacent to orthotopic colon cancer in mice . In the hyperplastic mucosa adjacent to KM12SM tumor in the cecum of athymic mice , VEGF upregulation was associated with hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF)-1alpha induction . The hyperplastic mucosa also showed hypoacetylation of histone H4 and reduction of both p53 and von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) proteins . To examine the effects of growth factors and cytokines on histone acetylation and levels of p53 , VHL and HIF-1alpha , the rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC6 was treated with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and interleukin ( IL)-15 for 35 days . Acetylated histone H4 , p53 protein and ubiquitinated protein levels were reduced , whereas HIF-1alpha production was upregulated in EGF- and IL-15-treated IEC6 cells . These findings suggest that EGF- or IL-15-induced histone H4 hypoacetylation is associated with repression of p53 and VHL genes in intestinal epithelial cells . The subsequent suppression of protein ubiquitination leads to upregulation of VEGF production by HIF-1alpha retention .
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the difference of angiogenic factors PDGF/dThdPase,VEGF expression and microvessel density ( MVD ) in primary hypopharyngeal tumor and metastasis lymph nodes . METHOD The author studied immunohistochemically a series of 48 primary hypopharyngeal carcinoma patients and metastasis lymph nodes were calculated . RESULT The percentage of VEGF was 25.38% in primary tumor and 21.52% in lymph nodes . No significant difference was found . The percentage of PDGF/dThdPase was 29.59% in primary tumor and and 21.2% in lymph nodes . This showed significent difference . VEGF showed significent difference between live and death group(P < 0.05 ) and among differentiation group ( P < 0.05 ) . MVD showed significant difference between live and death group , early and late stage group , and T1-2 and T3-4 group ( P < 0.05 ) . There were statistically significant correlations between the score of PDGF/ dThdPase , or VEGF and the score of MVD respectively . CONCLUSION The present study suggests that there was a correlation between VEGF or PDGF and MVD . VEGF and MVD were possible to be prognostic discriminators in hypopharyngeal carcinoma . PDGF expression in lymph nodes was significant higher than in primary tumors , and MVD expression in primary tumor was significant higher than in lymph nodes .
BACKGROUND The importance of cell-surface nucleolin in cancer biology was recently highlighted by studies showing that ligands of nucleolin play critical role in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis . By using a specific antagonist that binds the C-terminal tail of nucleolin , the HB-19 pseudopeptide , we recently reported that HB-19 treatment markedly suppressed the progression of established human breast tumor cell xenografts in the athymic nude mice without apparent toxicity . METHODS The in vivo antitumoral action of HB-19 treatment was assessed on the spontaneous development of melanoma in the RET transgenic mouse model . Ten days old RET mice were treated with HB-19 in a prophylactic setting that extended 300 days . In parallel , the molecular basis for the action of HB-19 was investigated on a melanoma cell line ( called TIII ) derived from a cutaneous nodule of a RET mouse . RESULTS HB-19 treatment of RET mice caused a significant delay in the onset of cutaneous tumors , several-months delay in the incidence of large tumors , a lower frequency of cutaneous nodules , and a reduction of visceral metastatic nodules while displaying no toxicity to normal tissue . Moreover , microvessel density was significantly reduced in tumors recovered from HB-19 treated mice compared to corresponding controls . Studies on the melanoma-derived tumor cells demonstrated that HB-19 treatment of TIII cells could restore contact inhibition , impair anchorage-independent growth , and reduce their tumorigenic potential in mice . Moreover , HB-19 treatment caused selective down regulation of transcripts coding matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 , and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the TIII cells and in melanoma tumors of RET mice . CONCLUSIONS Although HB-19 treatment failed to prevent the development of spontaneous melanoma in the RET mice , it delayed for several months the onset and frequency of cutaneous tumors , and exerted a significant inhibitory effect on visceral metastasis . Consequently , HB-19 could provide a novel therapeutic agent by itself or as an adjuvant therapy in association with current therapeutic interventions on a virulent cancer like melanoma .
Overexpression of the melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 ( MDA-7)/IL-24 in vitro generally results in the growth suppression and induction of apoptosis of diverse human tumor cells . In this study , we investigated the effects of overexpression of the MDA-7/IL-24 gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells in vitro and in vivo . Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of MDA-7 facilitated the MDA-7/IL-24-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in HCC cells , but not in the normal liver cell line L02 , and the effect was independent of the p53 status . Inhibition of metastasis and angiogenesis was correlated with decreasing expression of STAT3 , P-STAT3 , MMP-2 , VEGF , and TGF-beta genes , regulated by STAT3 in MHCCLM6 cells . We also showed that Ad.mda-7 combined with doxorubicin ( ADM ) had significantly enhanced antitumor and antimetastatic effects in vivo , accompanied by the downregulation of VEGF , MMP-2 , and TGF-beta genes and the upregulation of E-cadherin genes . These data suggested that MDA-7/IL-24 induces its selective antitumor properties in HCC cells by promoting apoptosis independent of p53 status , inhibiting subcutaneous tumor growth and metastasis , and increasing the effect of chemotherapeutic agents . MDA-7/IL-24 represents a new class of cancer suppressor genes that may be useful in the targeted therapy of HCC .
Despite the deployment of multimodal therapies involving neurosurgical resection , radio- and polychemotherapy , the prognosis for glioblastoma patients remains poor . These tumors are pathologically characterized by their associated angiogenesis and diffuse brain invasion , processes that are probably closely linked to the unfavorable prognosis of this disease . Accordingly , pharmacological inhibition of glioblastoma invasion and approaches that impede angiogenesis are considered to be promising therapeutic strategies to combat these tumors . Nevertheless , the anti-angiogenic therapies for glioblastoma currently available are transient and palliative at best . Blocking the effects of fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) may represent a novel mean of inhibiting the angiogenesis associated with glioblastoma , as it mediates the angiogenesis induced by other factors and it is an angiogenic factor by itself . In addition , the survival of glioma cells and their resistance to chemotherapeutic agents are highly FGF-dependent . We show here that a recently described inhibitor of FGF , 2,5-dihydroxyphenyl-sulfonate ( 2,5DHPS , dobesilate ) , stimulates the apoptosis of tumor cells , inhibits glioblastoma invasion and suppresses its associated angiogenesis . Moreover , this agent augments the efficiency of chemotherapeutic agents in a rat model of orthotopic brain tumor . These results suggest that 2,5DHPS treatment may represent a promising therapy for malignant glioma .
Pegylated Interferon-alpha2b ( pIFN-alpha ) is an integral part of the drug regimen currently employed against melanoma . Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the IFN response , cell cycle and apoptosis . We have studied pIFN-alpha induced responses when combined with the chemotherapy agent , vinblastine in tumor and endothelial cell lines and the connection to IRF-1 signaling . Levels of IRF-1/IRF-2 protein expression were found to be decreased in tumor versus normal tissues. pIFN-alpha induced IRF-1 signaling in human melanoma ( M14 ) and endothelial ( EA.hy926 ) cells and enhanced cell death when combined with vinblastine . Upon combined IFN-alpha and vinblastine treatment , p21 expression , PARP cleavage and activated Bak levels were increased in M14 cells . An increase in p21 and cyclin D1 expression occurred in EA.hy926 cells after 6 h of treatment with pIFN-alpha which dissipated by 24 h . This biphasic response , characteristic of cellular senescence , was more pronounced upon combined treatment . Exposure of the EA.hy926 cells to pIFN-alpha was associated with an enlarged , multinucleated , beta-galactosidase-positive senescent phenotype . The overall therapeutic mechanism of IFN-alpha combined with chemotherapy may be due to both direct tumor cell death via IRF-1 signaling and by premature senescence of endothelial cells and subsequent effects on angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment .
AIMS Angiogenesis from thyroid cancer cell plays the important roles in post-surgical persistent , recurrent , and metastatic papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) . This study is to investigate the expression of angiopoietin-1 ( Ang-1 ) , angiopoietin-2 ( Ang-2 ) , Tek/Tie-2 receptor , and vascular endothelial growth factors ( VEGF ) in normal , benign thyroid tissues and different stage of PTC . We expect angiogenetic factors are important in the presentation of local-regional neck or distant metastases in PTC . MATERIALS AND RESULTS A total of 101 tissues from the subjects underwent thyroidectomy were enrolled in the study . There were 22 control and 79 thyroid cancer patients in different TNM stagings were collected . Ang-1 illustrated highest mean immunostaining score in metastatic group . Comparing with normal and benign thyroid tissues , thyroid cancer tissues illustrated significantly high expression of three angiogenetic factors and Tie-2 receptor . Of the PTC , significantly high expression of three angiogenetic factors and Tie-2 receptor were illustrated in recurrent cases . VEGF showed statistical difference in disease-free cancer mortality , and recurrent groups . CONCLUSIONS Immunochemical staining illustrated VEGF , Ang-1 , Ang-2 expression in PTC tissues related to clinical staging ; however , we need more information concerning these factors with long-term follow-up results .
BACKGROUND Surgical procedures such as liver resection and liver transplantation are the first-line treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patients . However , the high incidence of tumor recurrence and metastasis after liver surgery remains a major problem . Recent studies have shown that hepatic ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R ) injury and endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) contribute to tumor growth and metastasis . We aim to investigate the mechanism of FTY720 , which was originally applied as an immunomodulator , on suppression of liver tumor metastasis after liver resection and partial hepatic I/R injury . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS An orthotopic liver tumor model in Buffalo rat was established using the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line McA-RH7777 . Two weeks after orthotopic liver tumor implantation , the rats underwent liver resection for tumor-bearing lobe and partial hepatic I/R injury . FTY720 ( 2 mg/kg ) was administered through the inferior caval vein before and after I/R injury . Blood samples were taken at days 0 , 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 and 28 for detection of circulating EPCs ( CD133+CD34+ ) . Our results showed that intrahepatic and lung metastases were significantly inhibited together with less tumor angiogenesis by FTY720 treatment . The number of circulating EPCs was also significantly decreased by FTY720 treatment from day 7 to day 28 . Hepatic gene expressions of CXCL10 , VEGF , CXCR3 , CXCR4 induced by hepatic I/R injury were down-regulated in the treatment group . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE FTY720 suppressed liver tumor metastasis after liver resection marred by hepatic I/R injury in a rat liver tumor model by attenuating hepatic I/R injury and reducing circulating EPCs .
Switching to a glycolytic metabolism is a rapid adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxia . Although this metabolic conversion may primarily represent a rescue pathway to meet the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of proliferating tumor cells , it also creates a gradient of lactate that mirrors the gradient of oxygen in tumors . More than a metabolic waste , the lactate anion is known to participate to cancer aggressiveness , in part through activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) pathway in tumor cells . Whether lactate may also directly favor HIF-1 activation in endothelial cells ( ECs ) thereby offering a new druggable option to block angiogenesis is however an unanswered question . In this study , we therefore focused on the role in ECs of monocarboxylate transporter 1 ( MCT1 ) that we previously identified to be the main facilitator of lactate uptake in cancer cells . We found that blockade of lactate influx into ECs led to inhibition of HIF-1-dependent angiogenesis . Our demonstration is based on the unprecedented characterization of lactate-induced HIF-1 activation in normoxic ECs and the consecutive increase in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) expression . Furthermore , using a variety of functional assays including endothelial cell migration and tubulogenesis together with in vivo imaging of tumor angiogenesis through intravital microscopy and immunohistochemistry , we documented that MCT1 blockers could act as bona fide HIF-1 inhibitors leading to anti-angiogenic effects . Together with the previous demonstration of MCT1 being a key regulator of lactate exchange between tumor cells , the current study identifies MCT1 inhibition as a therapeutic modality combining antimetabolic and anti-angiogenic activities .
BACKGROUND : To quantify tumour angiogenesis , microvessel density ( MVD ) has been widely used . We here present a novel angiogenesis marker , microvessel proliferation ( MVP ) , based on dual immunohistochemical staining of nestin and Ki-67 . Immature endothelial cells express nestin , and when co-expressed with the proliferation marker Ki-67 , the number of proliferating immature blood vessels can be measured . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Microvessel proliferation was evaluated in 178 breast cancer samples and estimated by vascular proliferation index ( VPI ) , the ratio between the number of vessels containing proliferating endothelial cells and the total number of immature vessels . RESULTS : High VPI was strongly associated with several markers of aggressive breast cancer , such as negative oestrogen receptor ( ER ) status ( p=0.003 ) , high tumour cell proliferation by Ki-67 ( p=0.004 ) , high p53 expression ( p=0.001 ) , and five profiles for the basal-like phenotype ( odds ratios ( OR ) ; range 3.4-6.3 ) . Also , high VPI was significantly associated with interval detected breast cancer compared with screening detected lesions ( p<0.0005 ) , and adverse outcome in univariate and multivariate survival analysis ( p=0.034 and p=0.022 , respectively ) . CONCLUSION : Microvessel proliferation is a novel marker of ongoing angiogenesis and was associated with aggressive tumour features , basal-like phenotypes , interval presentation , and prognosis in this series of breast cancer .
Objective . The present study was performed to investigate the effect of N-desulfated heparin on basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) expression , tumor angiogenesis and metastasis of gastric carcinoma . Methods . Human gastric cancer SGC-7901 tissues were orthotopically implanted into the stomach of NOD SCID mice . Twenty mice were randomly divided into two groups which received either intravenous injection of 0.9% NaCl solution ( normal saline group ) or 10 mg/kg N-desulfated heparin ( N-desulfated heparin group ) twice weekly for three weeks . In vitro , human gastric carcinoma SGC-7901 cells were treated with N-desulfated heparin in different concentration ( 0.1 mg/mL , 1 mg/mL , N-desulfated heparin group ) , and treated with medium ( control group ) . Results . In vivo , the tumor metastasis rates were 9/10 in normal saline group and 2/10 in N-desulfated heparin group ( P < 0.05 ) . The intratumoral microvessel density was higher in normal saline group than in N-desulfated heparin group ( P < 0.05). bFGF expression in gastric tissue was inhibited by N-desulfated heparin ( P < 0.05 ) . There was no bleeding in N-desulfated heparin group . In vitro , N-desulfated heparin inhibited significantly bFGF protein and mRNA expression of gastric carcinoma cells ( P < 0.05 ) . Conclusions . N-desulfated heparin can inhibit the metastasis of gastric cancer through inhibiting tumor bFGF expression and tumor angiogenesis with no obvious anticoagulant activity .
Ovarian cancer-related angiogenesis is a complex process orchestrated by many positive and negative regulators . Many growth factors are involved in the development of the tumor-associated vasculature , and from these , endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor ( EG-VEGF ) seems to play a crucial role . EG-VEGF is the first organ-specific angiogenic factor and its effects are restricted to the endothelial cells of the endocrine glands . Although EG-VEGF was detected in both normal and neoplastic ovaries , its clinical significance remains controversial . In the present study , we analyzed 30 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer , and the immunohistochemical expression of EG-VEGF was compared with the conventional clinico-pathological parameters of prognosis . Neoplastic cells of the ovarian carcinoma expressed EG-VEGF in 73.33% of the cases , as a cytoplasmic granular product of reaction . We found a strong correlation between the expression of EG-VEGF at protein level and tumor stage , grade , and microscopic type . The expression of EG-VEGF was found in patients with stage III and IV , but not in stage II . The majority of serous adenocarcinoma , half of the cases with clear cell carcinoma and two cases with endometrioid carcinoma showed definite expression in tumor cells . No positive reaction was found in the cases with mucinous carcinoma . Our results showed that EG-VEGF expression is an indicator not only of the advanced stage , but also of ovarian cancer progression . Based on these data , we concluded that EG-VEGF expression in tumor cells of the epithelial ovarian cancer is a good marker of unfavorable prognosis and could be an attractive therapeutic target in patients with advanced-stage tumors , refractory conventional chemotherapy .
Cancer can be envisioned as a metabolic disease driven by pressure selection and intercellular cooperativeness . Together with anaerobic glycolysis , the Warburg effect , formally corresponding to uncoupling glycolysis from oxidative phosphorylation , directly participates in cancer aggressiveness , supporting both tumor progression and dissemination . The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) is a key contributor to glycolysis . It stimulates the expression of glycolytic transporters and enzymes supporting high rate of glycolysis . In this study , we addressed the reverse possibility of a metabolic control of HIF-1 in tumor cells . We report that lactate , the end-product of glycolysis , inhibits prolylhydroxylase 2 activity and activates HIF-1 in normoxic oxidative tumor cells but not in Warburg-phenotype tumor cells which also expressed lower basal levels of HIF-1\u03b1 . These data were confirmed using genotypically matched oxidative and mitochondria-depleted glycolytic tumor cells as well as several different wild-type human tumor cell lines of either metabolic phenotype . Lactate activates HIF-1 and triggers tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo , an activity that we found to be under the specific upstream control of the lactate transporter monocarboxylate transporter 1 ( MCT1 ) expressed in tumor cells . Because MCT1 also gates lactate-fueled tumor cell respiration and mediates pro-angiogenic lactate signaling in endothelial cells , MCT1 inhibition is confirmed as an attractive anticancer strategy in which a single drug may target multiple tumor-promoting pathways .
Endothelial cells respond to hypoxic changes with resultant accumulation of several metabolites and switch over to angiogenic phenotype . Although certain intermediates of glycolytic and oxidative metabolic pathways have been known to affect angiogenesis , the effect of citrate , which accumulates in certain tumors , on angiogenesis is not known . Therefore , the effect of citrate on angiogenesis was studied using different model systems . Increased vascularization in chorioallantoic membrane assay , increased endothelial sprouting in rat aortic rings , and increased expression of CD31 , E-selectin in endothelial cells suggested a possible proangiogenic effect of citrate . Upregulation of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor suggested that the effect of citrate involves modulation of expression of angiogenic growth factors . LY 294002 , an inhibitor of PI3K-Akt pathway , and wortmannin , an inhibitor of Akt pathway , reversed the effect of citrate in human umbilical vein endothelial cells . Citrate induced significant upregulation and activation of Akt in endothelial cells . Rapamycin , an inhibitor of mTOR , also reversed the effect of citrate in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and sprouting of aortic rings suggesting that the angiogenic effect of citrate involves activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway .
Prohibiting angiogenesis is an important therapeutic approach for fighting cancer and other angiogenic related diseases . Research focused on proteins that regulate abnormal angiogenesis has attracted intense interest in both academia and industry . Such proteins are able to target several angiogenic factors concurrently , thereby increasing the possibility of therapeutic success . Aquaporin-1 ( AQP1 ) is a water channel membrane protein that promotes tumour angiogenesis by allowing faster endothelial cell migration . In this study we test the hypothesis that AQP1 inhibition impairs tumour growth in a mouse model of melanoma . After validating the inhibitor efficacy of two different AQP1 specific siRNAs in cell cultures , RNA interference experiments were performed by intratumoural injections of AQP1 siRNAs in mice . After 6 days of treatment , AQP1 siRNA treated tumours showed a 75 % reduction in volume when compared to controls . AQP1 protein level , in AQP1 knockdown tumours , was around 75 % that of the controls and was associated with a significant 40 % reduced expression of the endothelial marker , Factor VIII . Immunofluorescence analysis of AQP1 siRNA treated tumours showed a significantly lower microvessel density . Time course experiments demonstrated that repeated injections of AQP1 siRNA over time are effective in sustaining the inhibition of tumour growth . Finally , we have confirmed the role of AQP1 in sustaining an active endothelium during angiogenesis and we have shown that AQP1 reduction causes an increase in VEGF levels . In conclusion , this study validates AQP1 as a pro-angiogenic protein , relevant for the therapy of cancer and other angiogenic-related diseases such as psoriasis , endometriosis , arthritis and atherosclerosis .
Heparanase is a mammalian endoglycosidase that degrades heparan sulfate at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix . The expression of heparanase was detected in a wide variety of human malignant tumors and closely associated with tumor invasion , metastasis , and angiogenesis . However , the specific roles of heparanase and its mechanisms of regulating the malignant potential of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells still remain unclear . In the present study , the expression of heparanase was down-regulated in NSCLC cell line by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide . Results showed that down-regulation of heparanase led to significant inhibition of invasive and proliferative potentials of A549 cells in vitro and in vivo . Further research demonstrated that down-regulation of heparanase significantly inhibited the angiogenic potential of A549 cells , which might be the mechanism responsible for the inhibition of A549 cell proliferation in BALB/c nude mice in vivo . These findings demonstrate that heparanase plays essential roles in regulating the invasion , proliferation , and angiogenesis of A549 cells .
The ARF locus is frequently inactivated in human cancer . The oncosuppressor ARF has indeed been described as a general sensor for different situation of cellular stress . We have previously demonstrated that ARF deficiency severely impairs inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo , establishing a role for ARF in the regulation of innate immunity . The aim of the present work was to get further insights into the immune functions of ARF and to evaluate its possible contribution to the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 or M2 phenotype . Our results demonstrate that resting Arf(-/-) macrophages express high levels of Ym1 and Fizz-1 , two typical markers of alternatively-activated macrophages ( M2 ) . Additionally , Arf(-/-) peritoneal macrophages showed an impaired response to lipopolysaccharide ( a classical inducer of M1 polaryzation ) and a reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines . Moreover , upon stimulation with interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) , an inducer of the M2 phenotype , well established M2 markers such as Fizz-1 , Ym1 and arginase-1 were upregulated in Arf(-/-) as compared with wild type macrophages . Accordingly , the cytokine and chemokine profile associated with the M2 phenotype was significantly overexpressed in Arf(-/-) macrophages responding to IL-4 . In addition , multiple pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF and MMP-9 were also increased . In summary , these results indicate that ARF contributes to the polarization and functional plasticity of macrophages .
Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) is a member of the epidermal growth factor family and has a variety of physiological and pathological functions . Modulation of HB-EGF activity might have a therapeutic potential in the oncology area . We explored the therapeutic possibilities by characterizing the in vitro biological activity of anti-HB-EGF monoclonal antibody Y-142 . EGF receptor ( EGFR ) ligand and species specificities of Y-142 were tested . Neutralizing activities of Y-142 against HB-EGF were evaluated in EGFR and ERBB4 signaling . Biological activities of Y-142 were assessed in cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis assays and compared with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab , the HB-EGF inhibitor CRM197 , and the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) antibody bevacizumab . The binding epitope was determined with alanine scanning . Y-142 recognized HB-EGF as well as the EGFR ligand amphiregulin , and bound specifically to human HB-EGF , but not to rodent HB-EGF . In addition , Y-142 neutralized HB-EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and ERBB4 , and blocked their downstream ERK1/2 and AKT signaling . We also found that Y-142 inhibited HB-EGF-induced cancer cell proliferation , endothelial cell proliferation , tube formation , and VEGF production more effectively than cetuximab and CRM197 and that Y-142 was superior to bevacizumab in the inhibition of HB-EGF-induced tube formation . Six amino acids in the EGF-like domain were identified as the Y-142 binding epitope . Among the six amino acids , the combination of F115 and Y123 determined the amphiregulin cross-reactivity and that F115 accounted for the species selectivity . Furthermore , it was suggested that the potent neutralizing activity of Y-142 was derived from its recognition of R142 and Y123 and its high affinity to HB-EGF . Y-142 has a potent HB-EGF neutralizing activity that modulates multiple biological activities of HB-EGF including cancer cell proliferation and angiogenic activities . Y-142 may have a potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent for the treatment of HB-EGF-dependent cancers .
Human CD93 , an epidermal growth factor ( EGF)-like domain containing transmembrane protein , is predominantly expressed in the vascular endothelium . Studies have shown that AA4 , the homolog of CD93 in mice , may mediate cell migration and angiogenesis in endothelial cells . Soluble CD93 has been detected in the plasma of healthy individuals . However , the role of soluble CD93 in the endothelium remains unclear . Recombinant soluble CD93 proteins with EGF-like domains ( rCD93D123 , with domains 1 , 2 , and 3 ; and rCD93D23 , with domains 2 and 3 ) were generated to determine their functions in angiogenesis . We found that rCD93D23 was more potent than rCD93D123 in stimulating the proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . Production of matrix-metalloproteinase 2 increased after the HUVECs were treated with rCD93D23 . Further , in a tube formation assay , rCD93D23 induced cell differentiation of HUVECs through phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase and extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1/2 signaling . Moreover , rCD93D23 promoted blood vessel formation in a Matrigel-plug assay and an oxygen-induced retinopathy model in vivo . Our findings suggest that the soluble EGF-like domain containing CD93 protein is a novel angiogenic factor acting on the endothelium .
Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) is a major form of chronic inflammation that can frequently progress to colon cancer . Several studies have demonstrated massive infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lamina propria and submucosa in the progression of UC-associated colon carcinogenesis . Macrophages contribute to the development of colitis-associated colon cancer ( CAC ) . However , the role of neutrophils is not well understood . To better understand the involvement of tumor-associated neutrophils ( TANs ) in the regulation of CAC , we used a mouse CAC model produced by administering azoxymethane ( AOM ) , followed by repeated dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) ingestion . This causes severe colonic inflammation and subsequent development of multiple tumors in mice colon . We observed that colorectal mucosal inflammation became increasingly severe with AOM and DSS treatment . Macrophages infiltrated the lamina propria and submucosa , together with a marked increase in neutrophil infiltration . The chemokine CXCL2 increased in the lamina propria and submucosal regions of the colons of the treated mice , together with the infiltration of neutrophils expressing CXCR2 , a specific receptor for CXCL2 . This process was followed by neoplastic transformation . After AOM and DSS treatment , the mice showed enhanced production of metalloproteinase ( MMP)-9 and neutrophil elastase ( NE ) , accompanied by excessive vessel generation and cell proliferation . Moreover , CXCL2 promoted neutrophil recruitment and induced neutrophils to express MMP-9 and NE in vitro . Furthermore , administration of neutrophil-neutralizing antibodies after the last DSS cycle markedly reduced the number and size of tumors and decreased the expression of CXCR2 , CXCL2 , MMP-9 , and NE . These observations indicate a crucial role for TANs in the initiation and progression of CAC and suggest that the CXCL2-CXCR2 axis might be useful in reducing the risk of UC-associated colon cancer .
The expression of the angiogenic phenotype is regulated by a balance of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors released into the tumor microenvironment . Nuclear protein 7 ( NOL7 ) , a novel tumor suppressor , acts as a master regulator of angiogenesis by downregulating pro-angiogenic factors and upregulating anti-angiogenic factors . Using cervical cancer as a model of investigation , we have previously shown that loss of NOL7 mRNA and protein expression is observed as early as the premalignant phase . Analysis of the gene failed to identify tumor-specific promoter methylation or coding region mutations , suggesting that NOL7 loss may be mediated by aberrant expression of its upstream regulators . In this study , we show that the RB tumor suppressor gene ( RB ) positively regulates NOL7 at the transcriptional level by recruiting transcription factors and transcription machinery proteins to its promoter region . Conversely , the loss of RB represses NOL7 transcription by inhibiting assembly of these proteins . This loss of NOL7 expression is also observed in RB-deficient human malignancies . Together , this work further characterizes the transcriptional activator function of RB and defines a potential role for RB in regulating angiogenesis through activation of NOL7 . Current anti-angiogenic therapies lack long-term efficacy , as they are unable to target the diverse angiogenic signals generated by tumors . Our data provide evidence to support the hypothesis that reactivation of pRB can potentially modulate the expression of the angiogenic phenotype through regulation of NOL7 . Therefore , this knowledge may be employed to design more comprehensive and effective therapies .
Previously , we reported that Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis and gastric cancer are closely associated with increased levels of hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) and that Korean red ginseng significantly reduced the severity of H. pylori-associated gastric diseases by attenuating H2S generation . Because the incubation of endothelial cells with H2S has been known to enhance their angiogenic activities , we hypothesized that the amelioration of H2S-induced gastric inflammation or angiogenesis in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) might explain the preventive effect of Korean red ginseng on H. pylori-associated carcinogenesis . The expression of inflammatory mediators , angiogenic growth factors , and angiogenic activities in the absence or presence of Korean red ginseng extracts ( KRGE ) were evaluated in HUVECs stimulated with the H2S generator sodium hydrogen sulfide ( NaHS ) . KRGE efficiently decreased the expression of cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase , enzymes that are essential for H2S synthesis . Concomitantly , a significant decrease in the expression of inflammatory mediators , including cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase , and several angiogenic factors , including interleukin ( IL)-8 , hypoxia inducible factor-1a , vascular endothelial growth factor , IL-6 , and matrix metalloproteinases , was observed ; all of these factors are normally induced after NaHS . An in vitro angiogenesis assay demonstrated that NaHS significantly increased tube formation in endothelial cells , whereas KRGE pretreatment significantly attenuated tube formation . NaHS activated p38 and Akt , increasing the expression of angiogenic factors and the proliferation of HUVECs , whereas KRGE effectively abrogated this H2S-activated angiogenesis and the increase in inflammatory mediators in vascular endothelial cells . In conclusion , KRGE was able to mitigate H2S-induced angiogenesis , implying that antagonistic action against H2S-induced angiogenesis may be the mechanism underlying the gastric cancer preventive effects of KRGE in H. pylori infection .
Metastasis is the most lethal attribute of human malignancy . High-level expression of survivin is involved in both carcinogenesis and angiogenesis in cancer . Previous studies indicate that a mutation of the threonine residue at position 34 ( Thr34Ala ) of survivin generates a dominant-negative mutant that induces apoptosis , inhibits angiogenesis , and suppresses highly metastatic breast carcinoma in mouse models . We investigated the efficacy of gene therapy with a survivin dominant-negative mutant and possible factors related to lymph node metastasis . The metastasis rate was compared between each group in order to find a survivin-targeted therapy against lymphangiogenesis in its earliest stages . We established lymph node metastasis models and treated animals with H22 tumors with Lip-mSurvivinT34A ( Lip-mS ) , Lip-plasmid ( Lip-P ) , or normal saline ( NS ) . Eight days after the last dose , five randomly chosen mice from each group were sacrificed . We detected the apoptotic index , microvessel density ( MVD ) , lymphatic microvessel density ( LMVD ) , and the expression of VEGF-D with immunohistochemistry . After the remaining animals were sacrificed , we compared the tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes in each group . Administration of mSurvivinT34A plasmid complexed with cationic liposome ( DOTAP/chol ) resulted in the efficacious inhibition of tumor growth and lymph node metastasis within the mouse H22 tumor model . These responses were associated with tumor cell apoptosis , and angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis inhibition . Our results suggested that Lip-mSurvivinT34A induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis , thus suppressing tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis . The mSurvivinT34A survivin mutant is a promising strategy of gene therapy to inhibit lymphatic metastasis .
