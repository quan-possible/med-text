Angiogenic factors produced by monocytes-macrophages are involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disorders characterized by persistent angiogenesis . The possibility was tested that interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) , which is a cytokine that is chemotactic for lymphocytes and neutrophils , is also angiogenic . Human recombinant IL-8 was potently angiogenic when implanted in the rat cornea and induced proliferation and chemotaxis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells . Angiogenic activity present in the conditioned media of inflamed human rheumatoid synovial tissue macrophages or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated blood monocytes was equally blocked by antibodies to either IL-8 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha . An IL-8 antisense oligonucleotide specifically blocked the production of monocyte-induced angiogenic activity . These data suggest a function for macrophage-derived IL-8 in angiogenesis-dependent disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis , tumor growth , and wound repair .
NIH-3T3 cells are non-tumorigenic when injected into athymic mice . If these cells are mixed with an extract of basement-membrane proteins ( matrigel ) and injected s.c. , they form locally invasive and highly vascularized tumors . Cells cultured from the NIH-3T3-matrigel-induced tumors showed a transformed phenotype and lacked contact inhibition . When cultured in a gel of matrigel , they proliferated and formed branched and invasive colonies . In contrast , the parental NIH-3T3 cells cultured on matrigel remained as cell aggregates and were not invasive . I.V. injections of the tumor-derived NIH-3T3 cells produced many colonies on the surface of the lungs , whereas the parental NIH-3T3 cells were not metastatic . Zymographic analysis of the conditioned media obtained from both the tumor-derived and parental NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated higher amounts of the 72-kDa gelatinase ( type-IV collagenase ) enzyme in the tumor-derived cells . Also , tumor-derived NIH-3T3 cells , but not parental NIH-3T3 cells , secreted the 92-kDa type-IV collagenase . These studies suggest that the interaction of pre-malignant NIH-3T3 cells with extracellular matrix components may contribute to the process of tumor progression .
Capillary endothelial cells can be induced to form capillary-like structures in vitro by plating on fibronectin-coated dishes ( Ingber , D. E. , and Folkman , J . ( 1989 ) J. Cell Biol. 109 , 317-330 ) , thereby mimicking angiogenesis . To assess the role of glycoproteins bearing asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in this process , we tested the effect of oligosaccharide processing inhibitors on the formation of capillary tubes . Deoxymannojirimycin , a compound that prevents synthesis of hybrid and complex-type oligosaccharides , inhibited the formation of capillary tubes . In contrast , swainsonine , an inhibitor that blocks synthesis of complex- but not hybrid-type oligosaccharides , did not inhibit tube formation . Lectin affinity chromatography of 2-[3H] mannose-labeled glycopeptides from endothelial cells induced to form tubes did not reveal a striking difference in the spectrum of oligosaccharides compared to uninduced cells . Since endothelial cells formed tubes normally in the presence of swainsonine , we analyzed glycopeptides from swainsonine-treated induced and uninduced cells . Cells induced to form tubes were enriched in monosialylated hybrid-type oligosaccharides sensitive to alpha-fucosidase , beta-galactosidase , and beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase , suggestive of sialyl Lewis-X determinants . We used an enzyme-linked immunoassay to measure sialyl Lewis-X epitopes on capillary endothelial cells and found that both induced and uninduced cells expressed sialyl Lewis-X epitopes . Deoxymannojirimycin and , to a lesser extent , swainsonine reduced the level of sialyl Lewis-X epitopes in cells induced to form capillary tubes , but neither compound affected the level of epitopes in cell monolayers . We conclude that synthesis of at least hybrid-type oligosaccharides is required for capillary tube formation in vitro and that an increase in monosialylated , fucosylated glycans on asparagine-linked oligosaccharides occurs during this process .
Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) has emerged as one of the most important angiogenic growth factors from experimental in vitro and in vivo studies . In the present study , we investigated the relationship between VEGF expression and microvessel density ( MVD ) and defined their prognostic relevance on a series of 242 patients with node-negative breast cancer , using immunohistochemical methods . In parallel , estrogen and progesterone receptors were quantitatively assessed using the dextran-charcoal technique and cell proliferation was evaluated as S-phase cell fraction according to ( 3)H-thymidine-labeling index ( TLI ) . The percentage of VEGF-expressing cells varied from 0-95% in the different tumors and was unrelated to menopausal status , tumor size or steroid receptor status . Conversely , a significant inverse relation was observed with patient age or tumor cell proliferation , albeit with very poor correlation coefficients . A significant relation was observed between VEGF expression and MVD ( r(s) = 0.55 , p < 0.001 ) . Clinical outcome analyzed as a function of high and low VEGF expression showed slight differences in terms of both disease-free survival ( DFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) that never reached statistical significance . Moreover , the trend was paradoxically in favor of patients with highly VEGF-expressing tumors . Finally , DFS and OS curves , when analyzed as a function of VEGF expression or MVD , were superimposable . In conclusion , our study did not highlight a prognostic relevance of VEGF expression in patients with node-negative breast cancer , as already observed for MVD .
Our previous studies have shown that genistein inhibits the growth of PC3 prostate cancer cells and induces apoptosis by inhibiting nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and Akt signaling pathways . To better understand the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which genistein exerts its effects on PC3 cells , we utilized cDNA microarray to interrogate 12,558 known genes to determine the gene expression profiles altered by genistein treatment . We found a total of 832 genes that showed a greater than twofold change after genistein treatment from two independent experiments with a high degree of concordance . Among these genes , 774 genes were down-regulated and 58 genes were up-regulated with genistein treatment . Cluster analysis showed nine different types of expression alternations . These genes were also subjected to cluster analysis according to their biological functions . We found that genistein regulated the expression of genes that are critically involved in the regulation of cell growth , cell cycle , apoptosis , cell signaling transduction , angiogenesis , tumor cell invasion and metastasis . Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analysis was used to confirm the results of cDNA microarray , and the results of RT-PCR were consistent with the microarray data . We conclude that genistein affected the expression of a large number of genes that are related to the control of cell survival and physiologic behaviors . The gene expression profiles provide comprehensive molecular mechanism(s) by which genistein exerts its pleiotropic effects on cancer cells . Genistein-induced regulation of these genes may be further exploited for devising chemopreventive and/or therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer .
Tumor metastasis represents a complex multistep process that requires migration , invasion , and angiogenesis . In this study , we examined the impact of molecular blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor on the invasive and metastatic capacity of human squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the head and neck using in vitro and in vivo model systems . Treatment with the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody C225 attenuated the migration of SCC-1 tumor cells through a chemotaxis chamber in a dose-dependent manner . Incubation of SCC cells with 10-100 nM C225 for 4 h resulted in 40-60% inhibition of cell migration . Furthermore , in the presence of C225 , the capacity of SCC-1 to invade across a layer of extracellular matrix ( Matrigel ) was significantly inhibited . Using an in vivo orthotopic floor-of-mouth xenograft model , locoregional tumor invasion of SCC-1 into muscle , vessel , bone , and perineural tissues was inhibited in C225-treated mice . This inhibition was additionally characterized by down-regulation in the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 . These data suggest that inhibition of metastatic potential by C225 may be mediated via decreased migration and invasion of SCC cells . Regarding angiogenesis in vitro , we first studied human umbilical vascular endothelial cells , which established a capillary-like network structure ( tube formation ) in the presence of reconstituted Matrigel . Treatment with C225 reduced cell-to-cell interaction of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells , resulting in disruption of tube formation . The effect of C225 was additionally examined using an in vivo tumor xenograft neovascularization model of angiogenesis . Systemic treatment with C225 not only reduced tumor growth and the number of blood capillaries but also hindered the growth of established vessels toward the tumor . Taken together , these results provide evidence that C225 can suppress tumor-induced neovascularization and metastasis in SCC of the head and neck .
A number of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs designed to have cytotoxic actions on tumor cells have recently been shown to also have antiangiogenic activities . Endothelial cell migration and proliferation are key components of tumor angiogenesis , and agents that target the microtubule cytoskeleton can interfere with these processes . In this study , the effect on endothelial cell functions of the microtubule-stabilizing drugs Taxotere and Taxol were evaluated in three in vitro assays : a chemokinetic migration assay , an angiogenesis factor-mediated chemotactic migration assay , and a three-dimensional Matrigel tubule formation assay , using rat fat pad endothelial cells ( RFPECs ) and/or human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . Taxotere was active in all three assays at concentrations that were not cytotoxic and did not inhibit endothelial cell proliferation . In the RFPEC chemokinetic migration and in vitro tubule formation assays , the IC50 values were approximately 10(-9) M for both Taxotere and Taxol . HUVEC migration , however , was more sensitive to Taxotere , with an observed IC50 of 10(-12) M in a chemokinetic assay . In a Boyden chamber assay , HUVEC chemotaxis stimulated by either of two angiogenic factors , thymidine phosphorylase or vascular endothelial growth factor , was inhibited by Taxotere with an IC50 of 10(-11) M and was ablated at 10(-9) M. Taxotere was also up to 1000-fold more potent than Taxol in inhibiting either chemokinetic or chemotactic migration . When the microtubule cytoskeleton was visualized using immunofluorescence staining of alpha-tubulin , there were no gross morphological changes observed in HUVECs or RFPECs treated with Taxotere at concentrations that inhibited endothelial cell migration but not proliferation . The effects of Taxotere on migration were associated with a reduction in the reorientation of the cell's centrosome , at concentrations that did not affect gross microtubule morphology or proliferation . Reorientation of the centrosome , which acts as the microtubule organizing center , in the intended direction of movement is a critical early step in the stabilization of directed cell migration . These data indicate that endothelial cell migration correlates more closely with changes in microtubule plasticity than with microtubule gross structure . The antiangiogenic activity of Taxotere in vivo was assessed in a Matrigel plug assay . In this assay , the angiogenic response to fibroblast growth factor 2 was inhibited in vivo by Taxotere with an ID50 of 5.4 mg/kg when injected twice weekly over a 14-day period , and angiogenesis was completely blocked in mice that received 10 mg/kg Taxotere . The in vivo data further suggested that Taxotere had selectivity for endothelial cell migration and/or microvessel formation because infiltration of inflammatory cells into the Matrigel plug was much less sensitive to inhibition by Taxotere . In conclusion , Taxotere is a potent and potentially specific inhibitor of endothelial cell migration in vitro and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo .
BACKGROUND/PURPOSE Although angiogenic factors may play an important role in the biology of neuroblastoma , which frequently spreads hematogenously , the mechanism remains unclear . The authors studied tumor progression and invasion from the perspective of angiogenesis and sought to understand the features of this type of tumor . METHODS Thirty-one specimens were resected from patients with neuroblastoma and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , and its receptor ( Flk-1 ) was examined using immunohistochemistry . The authors looked for correlations among the expressions of VEGF and its receptor with various clinicopathologic factors . In addition , they examined the expression and location of VEGF and Flk-1 mRNA in 10 primary neuroblastoma using in situ hybridization . RESULTS Both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed the presence of VEGF expression within the neuroblastoma cells . We found VEGF mRNA in neuroblastoma cells but not vascular endothelial cells according to in situ hybridization . Further , Flk-1 mRNA was present both in neuroblastoma cells and vascular endothelial cells . The level of VEGF expression was higher in unfavorable histology , using the criteria of Shimada , than in favorable histology . CONCLUSION The authors suggest that paracrine and autocrine systems are involved in the angiogenesis of neuroblastoma , and the expression of VEGF correlates with the prognosis in neuroblastoma .
A6 is an eight amino acid peptide derived from the non-receptor binding region of urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) , which interferes with the uPA/uPA receptor system . A6 has been synthesized as a potential anti-angiogenic , anti-cancer agent . The current study has investigated the potential therapeutic activity of A6 in the Lewis lung carcinoma ( 3LL ) model of pulmonary metastasis . A6 was found to have direct anti-tumor activity against established 3LL pulmonary metastases at a low tumor burden ( 10-20 colonies per lung ) and was therapeutic in combination with cyclophosphamide at high tumor burdens ( > 100 colonies per lung ) . Mechanistic studies have revealed that A6 directly inhibits the invasion of 3LL cells through a Matrigel model basement membrane by 40-45% . Moreover , treatment with either A6 or doxorubicin resulted in thicker tubes in endothelial tube formation studies . Our results suggest that A6 , by virtue of its anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic properties , might work additively or synergistically with chemotherapeutic agents and thereby contribute to enhanced therapy of established 3LL cancer metastases .
Tumor-associated macrophages ( TAM ) have been shown to play an important role in tumor angiogenesis . The purpose of this study was to determine whether monocyte recruitment , activation and differentiation mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) and macrophage colony stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) modulate the expression of the angiogenic factor , Interleukin ( IL)-8 . Isolated human peripheral blood monocytes secreted low basal levels of IL-8 . Incubation of monocytes with M-CSF or MCP-1 resulted in an up-regulation of IL-8 mRNA and protein expression . The differential expression of IL-8 by monocytes following MCP-1 and M-CSF treatments involved activation of the NFkB transcription factor . Further activation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) caused an increase in IL-8 secretion in monocytes but not in monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ) . MDM-conditioned media significantly up-regulated IL-8 expression in human malignant melanoma cells in vitro . In summary , we demonstrated that MCP-1 and M-CSF , critical for monocyte recruitment , activation and differentiation , differentially regulate IL-8 expression and may play an important role in monocyte/macrophage-mediated tumor angiogenesis .
An in vitro angiogenesis system was designed for screening angiogenic agonists and antagonists . In order to obtain large quantities of cells and reproducibility , human endothelial cells with extended life spans were developed by retroviral transfection . The resulting cells grown in a serum-free medium containing endothelial cell growth supplement ( ECGS ) have a telomerase activity , extended life spans of at least 21 passages , and an endothelial cell phenotype ( diI-acetylated-LDL upake , factor VIII-related antigen , VEGFR-1 and R-2 , and tissue-type plasminogen activator ( tPA) ) that resembled that of unaltered primary endothelial cells . Exceptions were ( i ) a higher expression of tPA , and ( ii ) a non-significant growth response to FGF-2 or VEGF stimulation . Within three-dimensional fibrin gels , specific cell clones rapidly formed tubular structures in a more reproducible manner than those observed with low-passage primary cells . Tube formation by primary endothelial cells and those with extended life spans was dependent upon FGF-2 and ECGS , respectively . Both cell types produced FGF-2 and VEGF cytokines . Increasing doses of suramin significantly decreased the size of microvessels formed by both cell lines . These functional results indicate that a vascular matrix system containing human cells with extended life spans can be successfully utilized as an in vitro assay for antiangiogenic compounds .
Recent reports provide evidence that some growth factors behave as inhibitors of the apoptosis of the endothelial cells , bringing forward the concept of vascular survival as a post-angiogenesis process . At least two different vasculature development processes occur within a tumor : the angiogenic ( formation of new vessels ) and the vascular survival pathway , which is devoted to the preservation of the newly-formed vessels in layers that lose contact with the adjacent normal tissue . We developed a method to assess these processes in tissue samples . We noted that differences among tumors may exist not only in the tumor angiogenic activity ( TAA ) but also in the vascular survival ability ( VSA ) . One third of the highly angiogenic breast cancer cases examined had a poor ability to maintain high vessel density in inner tumor areas . Both parameters are independently related to prognosis , while VSA was directly related to tumor dimensions and node involvement . Patients with high TAA and VSA had a particularly poor prognosis . It is suggested that although cancer angiogenic activity is important for the local invasion and dissemination into vessels and lymphatics , the VSA may be important for the effective formation of viable tumor foci in lymph nodes or distant organs . Recognition and quantification of the vascular survival ability in human tumors may significantly improve the prognostic value of the assessment of tumor vasculature , and may help to stratify patients for clinical trials with novel anti-angiogenic or angiotoxic drugs . Elucidation of the pathways may provide additional targets for antiangiogenic therapy .
Modulation of the balance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors holds great promise for the treatment of a broad spectrum of human disease ranging from ischemic heart disease to cancer . This requires both the identification of angiogenic regulators and their efficient delivery to target organs . Here , we demonstrate the use of a noncatalytic fragment of matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( termed PEX ) delivered by lentiviral vectors in different angiogenesis models . Transduction of human endothelial cells with PEX virus suppressed endothelial invasion and formation of capillary-like structures without affecting chemotaxis in vitro . Lentiviral delivery of PEX blocked basic fibroblast growth factor-induced matrix metalloproteinase 2 activation and angiogenesis on chicken chorioallantoic membranes . PEX expression also inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis and tumor growth in a nude mouse model . Thus , our study shows that lentiviral vectors can deliver sufficient quantities of antiangiogenic substances to achieve therapeutic effects in vivo .
BACKGROUND Angiogenesis is of crucial importance for tumor growth and development of metastases . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) has a potent angiogenic activity and mutations of the p53 gene has been thought to upregulate VEGF . The purpose of our study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of these tumor biomarkers for angiogenesis relative to the information derived from established clinicopathological parameters in gastric cancer . METHODS In this study , we conducted an immunohistochemical investigation of VEGF and p53 expression in 145 tissue samples obtained from gastric cancer patients undergoing curative surgical treatment . To evaluate angiogenesis , microvessel density ( MVD ) was counted by staining endothelial cells immunohistochemically using anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody . RESULTS High MVD was significantly associated with depth of tumor invasion and distant metastasis ( p = 0.004 , 0.021 , respectively ) . Moreover , overall survival for patients with high MVD were significantly lower than that of low MVD ( p = 0.048 ) . Positive expression of VEGF correlated significantly with lymph node and distant metastasis ( p = 0.040 , 0.048 , respectively ) . However , no significant correlation was found between p53 expression and various clinicopathological parameters . VEGF positive tumors showed a higher MVD than VEGF negative tumors ( p = 0.028 ) . The expression of p53 did not correlate with VEGF expression . Also , the relationship between the status of p53 expression and MVD had not statistically significant differences . In the multivariate analysis , status of VEGF , p53 expression and MVD were not an independent prognostic factor . CONCLUSION VEGF seems to be an important , clinically relevant inducer of angiogenesis and angiogenesis assessed by the MVD may be a useful marker for predicting metastasis in gastric cancer . However , further studies are warranted to clarify the impact of p53 on the angiogenesis and the prognostic significance of angiogenesis in gastric cancer .
INTRODUCTION Cell-cell interaction is an essential component of atherosclerotic plaque development . Activated monocytes appear to play a central role in the development of atherosclerosis , not only through foam cell formation but also via the production of various growth factors that induce proliferation of different cell types that are involved in the plaque development . Using serum free co-culture method , we determined the effect of monocytes on endothelial cell proliferation . METHODS Endothelial cell proliferation is determined by the amount of [ 3H]thymidine incorporated in to the DNA . Basic fibroblast growth factor ( b-FGF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) levels in the conditioned medium were determined by ELISA . RESULTS Conditioned medium from unactivated monocytes partially inhibited endothelial cell proliferation , whereas conditioned medium from activated monocytes promoted endothelial cell proliferation . The mitogenic effect of conditioned medium derived from activated monocytes is due to the presence of b-FGF , VEGF and IL-8 . Neutralizing antibodies against b-FGF , VEGF and IL-8 partially reversed the mitogenic effect of conditioned medium derived from activated monocytes . When b-FGF , VEGF and IL-8 were immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium derived from activated monocytes , it is less mitogenic to endothelial cells . CONCLUSION Activated monocytes may play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic plaque by producing endothelial cell growth factors .
Contradictory results have been reported regarding the association between vascularity ( used as an index of angiogenesis ) and thrombospondin-1 ( TSP-1 ) in human tumours . In previous studies , the reported association was based on the estimated average TSP-1 value per tumour , with a sufficient number of specimens collectively analysed per tumour type . Given the extent of intra-tumour heterogeneity , we determined the association between TSP-1 and vascularity within individual specimens , based on the average values of TSP-1 and vascularity in 10-20 pre-selected areas per tumour . Cells expressing TSP-1 mRNA were visualised by in situ hybridisation and quantified by point counting . Vascularity was quantified by point counting and vessel density of von Willebrand Factor-positive vessels . In 10 ductal breast carcinomas , a direct correlation between TSP-1 and vascularity was found in 4 tumours , no correlation in 3 and an inverse correlation in 3 . The effect of TSP-1 on endothelial cell migration in vitro was assessed in the Boyden chamber assay . TSP-1 stimulated cell migration at low concentrations ( 0.1-10 microg/ml ) and was inhibitory at high concentrations ( 25-100 microg/ml ) . These results suggest that TSP-1 may elicit a concentration-dependent , bi-phasic , effect on angiogenesis .
There is increasing evidence for the implication of tumor-derived angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors in controlling tumor growth in vivo . In this study , we documented the production of inhibitors of angiogenesis by pancreatic cancer cells and examined how changes in the balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors regulate tumor growth in vivo . The human pancreatic cancer cell line Hs-776T ( HS-W ) produces slow-growing tumors in SCID mice . Cells of a variant form ( HS-R ) of Hs-776T produced faster-growing tumors compared to HS-W . Characterization of HS-W and HS-R cells in vitro showed similar proliferation rates and production of the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) . Analyzes of anti-angiogenic factors showed comparable levels of angiostatin and thrombospondin 1 and 2 , but endostatin was only detected in conditioned media of HS-W cells and was absent in HS-R . Cell proliferation was similar in both tumor types in vivo , whereas HS-W tumors demonstrated increased apoptosis with a high percentage of apoptotic endothelial cells ( EC ) . Subsequently , VEGF was over-expressed in Hs-776T cells ( HS-VF ) , resulting in rapidly growing tumors and lowering tumor and EC apoptosis . Collectively , our study confirms that tumor growth is dependent on its ability to increase the angiogenic stimulus or to reduce the amounts of endogenous anti-angiogenic factors .
There is little understanding of the factors controlling the mobilization of blast cells from bone marrow to peripheral blood and tissues . The aim of this study was to evaluate the soluble hepatocyte growth factor ( sHGF ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( sVEGF ) levels in newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) and to correlate these levels with the clinico-pathological features . Sixty-three patients with AML and 15 normal controls were included in this study . The levels of sHGF and sVEGF were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay at diagnosis and after remission induction chemotherapy . Our results revealed significantly increased plasma levels of sHGF and sVEGF at diagnosis when compared to both control and remission levels ( P=0.000 for both ) . The sHGF and sVEGF levels differed between AML FAB subtypes ( P=0.000 ) . The highest concentrations were found in M5 followed by M4 . SHGF and sVEGF were directly correlated with peripheral white cell counts ( WBC ) ( r=0.836 , P=0.000 , r=0.718 ; P=0.000 , respectively ) , but inversely correlated with blast cell distribution ratio ( BCDR ) ( r=-0.785 , P=0.000 , r=-0.664 , P=0.000 , respectively ) . Moreover , both sHGF and sVEGF levels were significantly elevated in AML patients with extra-medullary infiltration as compared to those without ( P=0.000 , 0.006 , respectively ) . The sHGF but not sVEGF levels were significantly elevated in patients who died compared to those who relapsed and to patients in complete remission ( P=0.02 , 0.08 , respectively ) . Logistic regression analysis revealed that the sHGF level at diagnoses is a powerful predictor of the patient outcome , compared to sVEGF . In conclusion : our data support the hypothesis that angiogenic factors play a functional role in blast cell movement from the bone marrow to peripheral tissues . Assessment of sHGF at AML diagnosis is likely to be helpful in predicting patient outcome and selecting optimal therapeutic regimen .
Vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) and its receptor tyrosine kinases located on endothelial cells seem to play an important role in the multistep pathway of angiogenesis . SU5416 is a small molecule which inhibits angiogenesis by acting as an inhibitor of VEGF receptor-2 tyrosine kinase . We have developed a reproducible murine model for neuroblastoma , a childhood cancer , based on s.c. xenotransplantation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells . We found that SH-SY5Y cells expressed VEGF-A on both the mRNA and protein levels , that plasma concentrations of VEGF-A were significantly elevated in animals with neuroblastoma with a volume > 1.4 ml , and that there was a correlation between VEGF-A levels in plasma and tumor size in untreated tumor-bearing animals . Treatment with SU5416 reduced the growth of neuroblastoma tumors by 65% without apparent toxicity . SU5416 treatment also suppressed tumor angiogenesis , despite an increase in plasma VEGF-A levels per ml tumor volume during therapy . Our experimental data suggest that the angiogenesis inhibitor SU5416 may be beneficial in the treatment of solid tumors of childhood such as neuroblastoma .
OBJECTIVE To study the effects of angiostatin(AS) gene mediated by liposome on human pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990 . METHODS Angiostatin gene was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV . The recombinant of pRC/CMV-AS was introduced into the pancreatic cancer cell line , SW1990 . The mechanism of anti-tumor was studied and tested . RESULTS The eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV-AS was identified by the restriction digest. pRC/CMV-AS was stably integrated into the target cells and expressed by Western blot and drug-sensitivity tests , and inhibited the vascular endothelial cells proliferation in vitro . In addition , the effects of the angiostatin vector on reducing the volume of tumors implanted in nude mouse models were also noted . CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that the recombinant pRC/CMV-AS mediated by liposome may play a potential role in the treatment of pancreatic cancer in the future .
Tumor endothelial marker ( TEM ) 5 is an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor upregulated in endothelial cells during tumor and physiologic angiogenesis . So far , the mechanisms leading to upregulation of TEM5 and its function during angiogenesis have not been identified . Here , we report that TEM5 expression in endothelial cells is induced during capillary-like network formation on Matrigel , during capillary morphogenesis in a three-dimensional collagen I matrix , and upon confluence on a two-dimensional matrix . TEM5 expression was not induced by a variety of soluble angiogenic factors , including VEGF and bFGF , in subconfluent endothelial cells . TEM5 upregulation was blocked by toxin B from Clostridium difficile , an inhibitor of the small GTPases Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 . The Rho inhibitor C3 transferase from Clostridium botulinum did not affect TEM5 expression , whereas the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 suppressed TEM5 upregulation . An excess of the soluble TEM5 extracellular domain or an inhibitory monoclonal TEM5 antibody blocked contact inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation resulting in multilayered islands within the endothelial monolayer and increased vessel density during capillary formation . Based on our results we conclude that TEM5 expression during capillary morphogenesis is induced by the small GTPase Rac and mediates contact inhibition of proliferation in endothelial cells .
OBJECTIVE To study the effects of genistein on the proliferation , apoptosis induction and expression of related gene proteins of human colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo , and its mechanisms of action . METHODS MTT colorimetric assay was used to detect the effects of genistein on the proliferation of human colon adenocarcinoma SW480 cells . Light and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the histological and ultrastructural changes . Flow cytometry was used to determine the effects of genistein on cell cycle and apoptosis . Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the effects of genistein on apoptosis induction and expression of related gene proteins of colon cancer cells . RESULTS The MTT colorimetric assay showed that genistein inhibited the proliferation of SW480 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner , and the highest inhibition rate was 60.2% after 80 microg/ml genistein treatment for 72 h . The light microscopy revealed that many genistein-treated cancer cells were shrunken , disrupted , or showing cytoplasmic vacuolization . The electron microscopic examination showed cell shrinkage , nuclear fragmentation and pronounced chromatin condensation , sometimes formed crescent chromatin condensation attached to the nuclear membrane . The results of flow cytometry showed that : after SW480 cells were treated with 0 , 20 , 40 , 80 microg/ml genistein for 48 h , the FI values of PCNA were 1.49 +/- 0.02 , 1.28 +/- 0.04 , 1.14 +/- 0.03 , and 0.93 +/- 0.08 ; the FI values of VEGF were 1.75 +/- 0.02 , 1.34 +/- 0.06 , 1.32 +/- 0.04 , and 1.23 +/- 0.04 ; the fluorescence index ( FI ) values of p21 were 1.26 +/- 0.05 , 1.36 +/- 0.06 , 1.61 +/- 0.03 , and 1.73 +/- 0.03 , respectively . There were statistically significant differences between the control group and each treatment group ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) . The scores of immunohistochemical staining of PCNA and VEGF proteins were decreased , while p21 increased . There were statistically significant differences between the control group and each treatment group ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSION Genistein can inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells via apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase . The anti-tumor mechanisms of genistein may be related with the down-regulation of expression of VEGF and PCNA , and up-regulation of the expression of p21 .
PURPOSE Tamoxifen , a selective oestrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) , and brivanib alaninate , a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR-2 ) inhibitor , are two target specific agents that result in a substantial decrease in tumour growth when given alone . Tamoxifen activates SERM stimulated breast and endometrial tumour growth . Tamoxifen and brivanib alaninate have side-effects that can affect therapeutic outcomes . The primary goal of the current study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of lower doses of both agents when given in combination to mice with SERM sensitive , oestrogen stimulated tumour xenografts ( MCF-7 E2 tumours ) . Experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of SERM stimulated breast ( MCF-7 Tam , MCF-7 Ral ) and endometrial tumours ( EnCa 101 ) to demonstrate the activity of brivanib alaninate in SERM resistant models . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In the current study , tumour xenografts were minced and bi-transplanted into the mammary fat pads of athymic , ovariectomised mice . Preliminary experiments were conducted to determine an effective oral dose of tamoxifen and brivanib alaninate that had minimal effect on tumour growth . Doses of 125 microg of tamoxifen and 0.05 mg/g of brivanib alaninate were evaluated . An experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of the two agents together when started at the time of tumour implantation . An additional experiment was done in which tumours were already established and then treated , to obtain enough tumour tissue for molecular analysis . RESULTS Brivanib alaninate was effective at inhibiting tumour growth in SERM sensitive ( MCF-7 E2 ) and SERM stimulated ( EnCa 101 , MCF-7 Ral , MCF-7 Tam ) models . The effect of the low dose drug combination as an anti-tumour strategy for SERM sensitive ( MCF-7 E2 ) in early treatment was as effective as higher doses of either drug used alone . In established tumours , the combination is successful at decreasing tumour growth , while neither agent alone is effective . Molecular analysis revealed a decreased phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in tumours that were treated with brivanib alaninate and an increase in VEGFA transcription to compensate for the blockade of VEGFR-2 by increasing the transcription of VEGFA . Tamoxifen increases the phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and this effect is abrogated by brivanib alaninate . There was also increased necrosis in tumours treated with brivanib alaninate . CONCLUSION Historically , tamoxifen has a role in blocking angiogenesis as well as the blockade of the ER . Tamoxifen and a low dose of an angiogenesis inhibitor , brivanib alaninate , can potentially be combined not only to maximise therapeutic efficacy but also to retard SERM resistant tumour growth .
" Reactive " or activated stroma characterizes many malignancies including breast cancers . Recently , we isolated a reactive mouse mammary gland stromal cell line called BJ3Z . These cells express alpha-smooth muscle actin and stromal cell-derived factor 1 ( SDF-1 ) and are tumorigenic when injected into mice . Here we show that , in vivo , BJ3Z cells influence the angiogenesis and proliferation of xenografted estrogen receptor ( ER)-positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cell-derived solid tumors . The growth-promoting effects of BJ3Z cells are equivalent to those of estradiol ( E(2) ) . BJ3Z cells also increase the proliferation of normal mouse mammary luminal cells adjacent to tumors . In vitro , BJ3Z cells reorganize and increase the proliferation of cocultured malignant MCF-7 and normal human breast MCF10A cells grown as organoids in three-dimensional culture . The effects of BJ3Z cells on MCF-7 cells are equivalent to those of E(2) . In contrast , BJ3Z cells do not alter the growth of highly aggressive ER-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells . We show that BJ3Z cells secrete vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . The growth of MCF-7 organoids induced by BJ3Z can be inhibited by antagonists of VEGF and SDF-1 . Conversely , recombinant VEGF stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 , but not MDA-MB-231 , organoids . We conclude that , in addition to angiogenesis , VEGF released by activated stroma increases the growth of ER-positive malignant epithelial cells and of adjacent normal epithelium . Because activated stroma can substitute for E(2) and fosters hormone-independent growth of ER-positive tumors , we suggest that breast cancers exhibiting intrinsic hormone resistance may respond to antiangiogenic therapies .
It has been shown that injecting a suspension of IFN-gamma-secreting tumor cells results in their rejection . This effect has been attributed to IFN-gamma preventing tumor stroma formation but not to a direct effect on the cancer cells . However , it is not known , which influence IFN-gamma has on tumors with an established stroma . To address this question , the plasmacytoma cell line J558L was transduced with a vector allowing doxycycline-inducible IFN-gamma gene expression . After the injection of the tumor cells into mice , IFN-gamma was induced at different time points . Tumors did not grow when inducing IFN-gamma immediately after tumor cell inoculation , while approximately half of the tumors were rejected when IFN-gamma was induced in early established tumors within 2 weeks . Induction of IFN-gamma 2-3 weeks after tumor cell inoculation was less efficient ( 0-17% rejection ) . IFN-gamma induction in established tumors led to a reduction of CD146(+) endothelial cells and massive necrosis . Together , we show that vascularized tumors can be rejected by local IFN-gamma expression , but that rejection of established tumors was less efficient over time . This suggests that transplanted tumors became less susceptible to local IFN-gamma treatment the better they are established .
The deregulation of Met/hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) receptor tyrosine kinase signaling constitutes a common event in colorectal cancers . However , the physiopathological functions of such a deregulation remain poorly understood . In the present study , we investigated the role of the deregulation of Met receptor in the neoplastic transformation of intestinal epithelial cells . To do so , the normal , well-established and characterized rat intestinal epithelial IEC-6 cells were transduced with a retrovirus carrying the oncogenic constitutive active form of Met receptor , Tpr-Met . Herein , we show that compared with control IEC-6 cells , Tpr-Met-IEC-6 cells exhibit enhanced proliferation , loss of growth-contact inhibition , cell morphological alterations , actin cytoskeletal reorganization , loss of E-cadherin expression and anchorage-independent growth . Moreover , Tpr-Met-IEC-6 cells are conferred the capacity to produce the proangiogenic factor VEGF and to reduce the potent antiangiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 . Of significance , Tpr-Met-IEC-6 cells are endowed with the ability to elicit angiogenic responses and to form tumors and metastases in vivo . Hence , our study demonstrates for the first time that the sole oncogenic engagement of Met receptor in normal intestinal epithelial cells is sufficient to induce a wide array of cancerous biological processes that are fundamental to the initiation and malignant progression of colorectal cancers .
Reciprocity of inflammation , oxidative stress and neovascularization is emerging as an important mechanism underlying numerous processes from tissue healing and remodelling to cancer progression . Whereas the mechanism of hypoxia-driven angiogenesis is well understood , the link between inflammation-induced oxidation and de novo blood vessel growth remains obscure . Here we show that the end products of lipid oxidation , omega-(2-carboxyethyl)pyrrole ( CEP ) and other related pyrroles , are generated during inflammation and wound healing and accumulate at high levels in ageing tissues in mice and in highly vascularized tumours in both murine and human melanoma . The molecular patterns of carboxyalkylpyrroles are recognized by Toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) , but not TLR4 or scavenger receptors on endothelial cells , leading to an angiogenic response that is independent of vascular endothelial growth factor . CEP promoted angiogenesis in hindlimb ischaemia and wound healing models through MyD88-dependent TLR2 signalling . Neutralization of endogenous carboxyalkylpyrroles impaired wound healing and tissue revascularization and diminished tumour angiogenesis . Both TLR2 and MyD88 are required for CEP-induced stimulation of Rac1 and endothelial migration . Taken together , these findings establish a new function of TLR2 as a sensor of oxidation-associated molecular patterns , providing a key link connecting inflammation , oxidative stress , innate immunity and angiogenesis .
Periplocin is one of cardenolides isolated from cortex periplocae which is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and reinforcement of bones and tendons in traditional medicine . Here , we investigated the anti-tumor activity of periplocin against lung cancer cells bothin vitro and in vivo , and explored its anti-cancer mechanism . Periplocin inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells and induced their apoptosis in time- and dose-dependent manners by cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase . Periplocin exhibited anti-tumor activity both in human ( A549 ) and mouse ( LL/2 ) lung cancer xenograft models . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that intratumoral angiogenesis was significantly suppressed . Furthermore , anti-cancer activity mediated by periplocin was associated with decreased level of phosphorylated AKT and ERK both in vitro and in vivo , which were important for cell growth and survival . Moreover , periplocin induced apoptosis by downregulating Bcl-2 and upregulating Bax , leading to activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 . These findings suggested that periplocin could inhibit the growth of lung cancer both in vitro and in vivo , which could be attributed to the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis signaling pathway , such as AKT and ERK . These observations provide further evidence on the anti-tumor effect of periplocin , and it may be of importance to further explore its potential role as a therapeutic agent for cancer .
Melanoma progression is associated with the expression of different growth factors , cytokines , and chemokines . Because TGFbeta1 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved not only in physiologic processes but also in cancer development , we analyzed in A375 human melanoma cells , the effect of TGFbeta1 on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) and interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) expression , two known factors responsible for melanoma progression . TGFbeta1 increased the expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 in A375 cells , an effect mediated by the cross-talk between Smad , PI3K ( phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT , and BRAF-MAPK ( mitogen activated protein kinase ) signaling pathways . Supernatants from TGFbeta1-treated A375 cells enhanced MCP-1-dependent migration of monocytes , which , in turn , expressed high levels of TGF,beta1 , bFGF , and VEGF mRNA . Moreover , these supernatants also inhibited functional properties of dendritic cells through IL-10-dependent mechanisms . When using in vitro , the TGFbeta1-blocking peptide P144 , TGFbeta1-dependent Smad3 phosphorylation , and expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 were inhibited . In vivo , treatment of A375 tumor-bearing athymic mice with P144 significantly reduced tumor growth , associated with a lower macrophage infiltrate and decreased intratumor MCP-1 and VEGF levels , as well as angiogenesis . Finally , in C57BL/6 mice with B16-OVA melanoma tumors , when administered with immunotherapy , P144 decreased tumor growth and intratumor IL-10 levels , linked to enhanced activation of dendritic cells and natural killer cells , as well as anti-OVA T-cell responses . These results show new effects of TGFbeta1 on melanoma cells , which promote tumor progression and immunosuppression , strongly reinforcing the relevance of this cytokine as a molecular target in melanoma .
Dentin matrix protein 1 ( DMP1 ) is a member of the small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein ( SIBLING ) family , a group of proteins initially described as mineralized extracellular matrices components . More recently , SIBLINGs have been implicated in several key steps of cancer progression , including angiogenesis . Although proangiogenic activities have been demonstrated for 2 SIBLINGs , the role of DMP1 in angiogenesis has not yet been addressed . We demonstrate that this extracellular matrix protein induced the expression of vascular endothelial cadherin ( VE-cadherin ) , a key regulator of intercellular junctions and contact inhibition of growth of endothelial cells that is also known to modulate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR-2 ) activity , the major high-affinity receptor for VEGF . DMP1 induced VE-cadherin and p27(Kip1) expression followed by cell-cycle arrest in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) in a CD44-dependent manner . VEGF-induced proliferation , migration , and tubulogenesis responses were specifically blocked on DMP1 pretreatment of HUVECs . Indeed , after VE-cadherin induction , DMP1 inhibited VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and Src-mediated signaling . However , DMP1 did not interfere with basic fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis . In vivo , DMP1 significantly reduced laser-induced choroidal neovascularization lesions and tumor-associated angiogenesis . These data enable us to put DMP1 on the angiogenic chessboard for the first time and to identify this protein as a new specific inhibitor of VEGF-induced angiogenesis .
SCOPE In this study , we evaluated the efficacy of lycopene against the growth of prostate cancer in vivo . METHODS AND RESULTS Athymic nude mice were implanted subcutaneously with human androgen-independent prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells . They were supplemented with a low or a high dose of lycopene ( 4 and 16 mg/kg ) and a single dose of beta-carotene ( 16 mg/kg ) twice a week for 7 wk . At the end of the experiment , both lycopene and beta-carotene strongly inhibited the tumor growth , as evidenced by the decrease in tumor volume and tumor weight . High-dosage lycopene and beta-carotene significantly decreased the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in tumor tissues and increased the levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 in plasma . In addition , high-dosage lycopene supplementation significantly decreased the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) levels in plasma . In contrast , beta-carotene supplementation significantly increased the VEGF levels , as compared with tumor control group . CONCLUSION Lycopene and beta-carotene supplementation suppressed the growth of prostate tumor cells , and the effects are likely associated with reduction of proliferation ( attenuation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression ) and with interference of the insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling ( increased plasma insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 levels ) . Furthermore , the inhibition of VEGF by lycopene suggests that the antitumor mechanisms of lycopene also involve anti-angiogenesis .
The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug tepoxalin on canine tumour cell growth and describe the changes associated with tepoxalin treatment . In vitro experiments were performed to assess tepoxalin-associated alterations in tumour cell growth . Clinically achievable tepoxalin concentrations did not significantly alter tumour cell growth in vitro . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) production and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha dose-dependently increased in vitro in the presence of tepoxalin . A canine osteosarcoma xenograft was used to determine in vivo effects of tepoxalin on tumour growth and angiogenesis . Despite increased VEGF in vitro , there was a significant growth delay associated with tepoxalin treatment . Normal dogs were administered tepoxalin to assess effects on systemic VEGF production , but not found to have significantly increased VEGF . These data suggest that tepoxalin may moderately inhibit tumour growth and may be administered as an analgesic to tumour-bearing dogs .
BACKGROUND Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , a potent regulator of cellular homeostasis , is associated with aggressive tumor behavior . The mechanism by which EGFR inhibition functions is unclear , with controversial results demonstrating an effect on the tumor cells , endothelial cells , or pericytes . EGFR activation has been linked to the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , a known mitogen of angiogenesis , but the relationship between these factors and their effect on tumor vessel development is vague . We hypothesized that using an EGFR inhibitor on a human Ewing's sarcoma model would inhibit tumor growth by suppressing vessel proliferation . METHODS A cell proliferation assay was performed on the Ewing's sarcoma ( SK-NEP-1 ) cell line . Tumor cells were implanted intrarenally in athymic mice . Animals received daily gavage with vehicle or gefitinib 1 wk following implantation . Mice ( n = 12/cohort ) were euthanized 6 wk following implantation . Remaining mice were maintained without treatment for 2 wk . Vascular changes were assessed by angiography and immunohistochemically . EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) expression were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) . RESULTS Gefitinib suppressed in vitro cell growth with an IC(50) = 1.36 muM . Minimal tumor growth suppression was noted at 6 wk ( 6.01 <FFFD> 1.2 g in control versus 4.61 <FFFD> 0.9 g treated , P = 0.36 ) . After cessation of gefitinib , tumor growth was increased in both groups ( 7.37 <FFFD> 1.62 g versus 6.77 <FFFD> 1.53 g , P = 0.79 ) . Microvessel density was unchanged despite EGFR inhibition ( 161,000 <FFFD> 16,000 pixels versus 135,000 <FFFD> 18,000 pixels , P = 0.31 ) . At 6 wk , the vascular maturity index was similar in both groups ( 3.63 <FFFD> 1.12 versus 4.09 <FFFD> 1.71 , P = 0.83 ) . A downward trend in EGFR expression ( 49% of control ) and an upward trend in VEGF levels ( 50% of control ) occurred in the treated group . CONCLUSIONS EGFR expression was suppressed in cultured cells and xenograft tumors . Despite a cytotoxic effect on cell lines , gefitinib had little effect on tumor growth . No effects on the tumor vasculature were noted in the setting of EGFR suppression , suggesting that angiogenesis induced by SK-NEP-1 cells is refractory to EGFR inhibition . Interestingly , the resulting increase in VEGF expression following EGFR blockade , provides an alternative pro-angiogenic pathway promoting tumor survival .
Programmed cell death 6 ( PDCD6 ) was originally found as a pro-apoptotic protein , but its molecular mechanism is not well understood . In this study , we have attempted to investigate the effects of PDCD6 on the inhibition of angiogenesis-mediated cell growth as a novel anti-angiogenic protein . Purified recombinant human PDCD6 inhibited cell migration in a concentration-time-dependent manner . We also found that overexpressed PDCD6 suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-induced proliferation , invasion , and capillary-like structure tube formation in vitro . PDCD6 suppressed phosphorylation of signaling regulators downstream from PI3K , including Akt , mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) , glycogen synthase kinase-3beta(GSK-3beta) , ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( p70S6K ) , and also decreased cyclin D1 expression . We found binding PDCD6 to VEGFR-2 , a key player in the PI3K/mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway . Taken together , these data suggest that PDCD6 plays a significant role in modulating cellular angiogenesis .
We recently isolated an exon-4-deleted epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) variant , termed de4 EGFR . Because the extracellular domain alteration of receptors often influences the antitumor effect of therapeutic antibodies , it is essential to test the sensitivity of de4 EGFR(+) tumors to anti-EGFR antibodies . Therefore , in this study , the antitumor activities of mAb CH12 , an anti-EGFRvIII antibody developed in our laboratory , as well as a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-EGFR antibody , cetuximab ( C225 ) , were characterized on de4 EGFR(+) models . The results of FACS assays showed that CH12 bound to de4 EGFR with a higher avidity than did C225 . Interestingly , CH12 , but not C225 , significantly inhibited the metastasis and growth of U87MG-de4 EGFR xenografts , with a growth-inhibition ratio of 46.48% in vivo , and prolonged the survival of the tumor-bearing mice by 37.2% . Treatment with CH12 significantly suppressed tumor proliferation and angiogenesis with increased tumor apoptosis . Mechanistically , de4 EGFR protein expression was virtually undetectable in the U87MG-de4 EGFR xenografts treated with CH12 . This may account for the observed reduction of Akt and Erk phosphorylation , cyclin D1 , Bcl-2 , and Bcl-x(L) expression and the increase of p27 and E-cadherin expression . Intriguingly , LAMP-1 , a major component of the lysosome , was significantly up-regulated in the CH12-treated group but not in the C225-treated group , suggesting its contribution to the degradation of de4 EGFR . Taken together , our data demonstrated that mAb CH12 is a promising therapeutic agent for treating de4 EGFR(+) gliomas .
Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR-TKIs ) show dramatic antitumor activity in a subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have an active mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene . On the other hand , some lung cancer patients with wild type EGFR also respond to EGFR-TKIs , suggesting that EGFR-TKIs have an effect on host cells as well as tumor cells . However , the effect of EGFR-TKIs on host microenvironments is largely unknown . A multiple organ metastasis model was previously established in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient mice using human lung cancer cells . This model was used to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of erlotinib , an EGFR-TKI , on multiple organ metastases induced by human small cell lung cancer cells ( SBC-5 cells ) that did not express EGFR . Although erlotinib did not have any effect on the proliferation of SBC-5 cells in vitro , it significantly suppressed bone and lung metastases in vivo , but not liver metastases . An immunohistochemical analysis revealed that , erlotinib significantly suppressed the number of osteoclasts in bone metastases , whereas no difference was seen in microvessel density . Moreover , erlotinib inhibited EGF-induced receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B expression in an osteoblastic cell line ( MC3T3-E1 cells ) . These results strongly suggested that erlotinib prevented bone metastases by affecting host microenvironments irrespective of its direct effect on tumor cells .
Cancer cells universally increase glucose and glutamine consumption , leading to the altered metabolic state known as the Warburg effect ; one metabolic pathway , highly dependent on glucose and glutamine , is the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway . Increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway leads to increases in the post-translational addition of O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine ( O-GlcNAc ) to various nuclear and cytosolic proteins . A number of these target proteins are implicated in cancer , and recently , O-GlcNAcylation was shown to play a role in breast cancer ; however , O-GlcNAcylation in other cancers remains poorly defined . Here , we show that O-GlcNAc transferase ( OGT ) is overexpressed in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate epithelium and that OGT protein and O-GlcNAc levels are elevated in prostate carcinoma cell lines . Reducing O-GlcNAcylation in PC3-ML cells was associated with reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-2 , MMP-9 , and VEGF , resulting in inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis . OGT-mediated regulation of invasion and angiogenesis was dependent upon regulation of the oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1 , a key regulator of invasion and angiogenesis , as reducing OGT expression led to increased FoxM1 protein degradation . Conversely , overexpression of a degradation-resistant FoxM1 mutant abrogated OGT RNAi-mediated effects on invasion , MMP levels , angiogenesis , and VEGF expression . Using a mouse model of metastasis , we found that reduction of OGT expression blocked bone metastasis . Altogether , these data suggest that as prostate cancer cells alter glucose and glutamine levels , O-GlcNAc modifications and OGT levels become elevated and are required for regulation of malignant properties , implicating OGT as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cancer .
OBJECTIVE Expression of N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 ( NDRG1)/Cap43 is a prognostic indicator of human malignancies according to the tumor type in which it occurs . We investigated how NDRG1/Cap43 could affect tumor growth and angiogenesis in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) in vivo using an animal experimental model , and also how it could affect tumor angiogenesis and prognosis in NSCLC patients . METHODS AND RESULTS Knockdown of NDRG1/Cap43 in lung cancer cells using a specific small interfering RNA resulted in growth rates in culture that were similar to those of counterpart control cells , but decreased tumor growth rates in vivo markedly . Stable NDRG1/Cap43 knockdown did not induce consistent changes in the expression of Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) family proteins and c-Met in two human lung cancer cell lines in vitro . However , cell lines with NDRG1/Cap43 knockdown showed markedly decreased production of the potent angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor-A and interleukin-8 . Cells with knockdown of NDRG1/Cap43 showed marked reduction of tumor-induced angiogenesis . Using immunohistochemistry , we examined 182 surgically resected specimens of NSCLC for expression of NDRG1/Cap43 and tumor angiogenesis . High microvessel density in the tumor was significantly associated with nuclear positivity for NDRG1/Cap43 in both adenocarcinoma ( p = 0.003 ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( p=0.041 ) . For both adenocarcinoma ( p = 0.031 ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( p=0.034 ) , the survival curve of patients negative for nuclear NDRG1/Cap43 expression differed significantly from that of patients who were positive . CONCLUSION Therefore , the expression of NDRG1/Cap43 may be predictive of tumor angiogenesis and poor prognosis in NSCLC .
Curcumin , a well-known chemopreventive agent from turmeric , inhibits the expression of several oncogenes and cell proliferation genes in tumor cells . This study aims to understand the precise molecular mechanism by which curcumin exerts its effects on retinoblastoma cells , by performing whole genome microarray analysis to determine the gene expression profiles altered by curcumin treatment . Curcumin suppressed cell viability and altered the cell cycle of retinoblastoma cells . We identified 903 downregulated genes and 1,319 upregulated genes when compared with the control cells after treatment with 20 muM curcumin concentration for 48 h . These genes were grouped into respective functional categories according to their biological function . We found that curcumin regulated the expression of genes that are involved in the regulation of apoptosis , tumor suppressor , cell-cycle arrest , transcription factor , and angiogenesis . Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) analysis was used to validate the results of genome array , and the results were consistent with the obtained data . In conclusion , treatment of curcumin affects the expression of genes involved in various cellular functions and plays an important role in tumor metastasis and apoptosis . Thus , curcumin might be an effective chemopreventive agent for retinoblastoma cancer .
The Salmonella type III secretion system ( T3SS ) efficiently translocates heterologous proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells . This leads to an antigen-specific CD8 T-cell induction in mice orally immunized with recombinant Salmonella . Recently , we have used Salmonella's T3SS as a prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against a murine fibrosarcoma . In this study , we constructed a recombinant Salmonella strain translocating the immunogenic H-2D(b)-specific CD8 T-cell epitope VILTNPISM ( KDR2 ) from the murine vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) . VEGFR2 is a member of the tyrosine protein kinase family and is upregulated on proliferating endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature . After single orogastric vaccination , we detected significant numbers of KDR2-tetramer-positive CD8 T cells in the spleens of immunized mice . The efficacy of these cytotoxic T cells was evaluated in a prophylactic setting to protect mice from challenges with B16F10 melanoma cells in a flank tumor model , and to reduce dissemination of spontaneous pulmonary melanoma metastases . Vaccinated mice revealed a reduction of angiogenesis by 62% in the solid tumor and consequently a significant decrease of tumor growth as compared to non-immunized mice . Moreover , in the lung metastasis model , immunization with recombinant Salmonella resulted in a reduction of the metastatic melanoma burden by approximately 60% .
BACKGROUND Recent data indicate the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) pathway is required for VEGF production and angiogenesis in various types of cancers . STAT3 inhibitors have been shown to reduce tumor microvessel density in tumors but a direct anti-angiogenic activity has not been described . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We investigated the direct action of a small molecule inhibitor of STAT3 ( LLL12 ) in human umbilical cord vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) in vitro , in a Matrigel model for angiogenesis in vivo , and its antitumor activity in a xenograft model of osteosarcoma . LLL12 ( 100 nM ) significantly inhibited VEGF-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation in HUVECs , reduced their proliferation/migration and inhibited VEGF-induced tube formation . Morphologic analysis of LLL12 treated HUVECs demonstrated marked changes in actin/tubulin distribution and bundling . In scid mice , LLL12 reduced microvessel invasion into VEGF-infused Matrigel plugs by ~90% at a dose of 5 mg/kg daily . Following a period of tumor progression ( 2 weeks ) , LLL12 completely suppressed further growth of established OS-1 osteosarcoma xenografts . Pharmacodynamic studies showed robust phosphorylated STAT3 in control tumors , whereas phospho-STAT3 was not detected in LLL12-treated OS-1 tumors . Treated tumors demonstrated decreased proliferation ( Ki67 staining ) , and decreased microvessel density ( CD34 staining ) , but no significant increase in apoptosis ( TUNEL staining ) , relative to controls . Assay of angiogenic factors , using an antibody array , showed VEGF , MMP-9 , Angiopoietin1/2 , Tissue Factor and FGF-1 expression were dramatically reduced in LLL12-treated tumors compared to control tumors . CONCLUSIONS These findings provide the first evidence that LLL12 effectively inhibits tumor angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo .
AIM We studied expression of molecules of the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) pathway and its relation to vascularization , cell proliferation and patient outcome in recurring non-anaplastic meningioma . We studied 29 tumor specimens of 8 patients with recurring meningiomas and of 8 age- and gender-matched control patients with non-recurring meningiomas ( including meningothelial , transitional , fibroblastic and atypical subtypes ) using immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization . RESULTS VEGF protein , VEGF-mRNA , VEGF receptor ( VEGFR)-1 mRNA , VEGFR-2 mRNA and hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF)-1-alpha protein were expressed in 27/29 ( 93% ) , 20/27 ( 74% ) , 9/27 ( 33.3% ) , 12/27 ( 44.4% ) and 5/29 ( 17.2% ) specimens , respectively . VEGFR- 2 mRNA expression was found in 6/8 tumors extracted at first operation in patients with recurring tumors and in none of the control cases ( p = 0.007 ) . Microvessel density ( MVD ) and Ki-67 index values were generally higher in meningiomas with expression of angiogenic factors . The association of high Ki-67 index values with VEGF-mRNA expression was significant ( p = 0.04 ) . Time to recurrence was shorter in patients with high MVD than in patients with low MVD ( p = 0.027 ) . CONCLUSIONS High MVD correlates with unfavorable prognosis in our series of recurring meningioma . VEGF and its receptors are frequently expressed in meningiomas and seem important for tumor growth and recurrence . Thus , anti-VEGF therapy in aggressive meningioma seems rational from a pathobiological point of view .
Even when patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer undergo surgical resection at an early stage , recurrent disease often impairs the clinical outcome . There are numerous causes potentially responsible for a relapse of the disease , one of them being extensive angiogenesis . The balance of at least two systems , VEGF VEGFR and Ang Tie , regulates vessel formation . The aim of this study was to determine the impact of surgery on the plasma levels of the main angiogenic factors during the first month after surgery in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients . The study group consisted of 37 patients with stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer . Plasma concentrations of Ang1 , Ang2 , sTie2 , VEGF , and sVEGF R1 were evaluated by ELISA three times : before surgical resection and on postoperative days 7 and 30 . The median of Ang2 and VEGF concentrations increased on postoperative day 7 and decreased on day 30 . On the other hand , the concentration of sTie2 decreased on the 7th day after resection and did not change statistically later on . The concentrations of Ang1 and sVEGF R1 did not change after the surgery . Lung cancer resection results in proangiogenic plasma protein changes that may stimulate tumor recurrences and metastases after early resection .
BACKGROUND Peritoneal transport status is important not only for prescription , but also as a prognostic index . Flt-1 and Flk-1 , the major vascular endothelial growth factor receptors involved in angiogenesis and hyperpermeability , may play a potent role in determining peritoneal transport characteristics . However , the relationship between them has not been studied to date . We hypothesized that Flt-1 and Flk-1 expression in the peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients could be closely related to baseline peritoneal transport status . METHODS Thirty-six new patients without a previous history of peritonitis were enrolled . Clinical parameters such as age , sex , height , weight , causes of renal failure , and residual renal function were assessed . Parietal peritoneal biopsies were obtained during implantation of peritoneal dialytic catheters . Flt-1 and Flk-1 were semi-quantitatively evaluated by immunohistochemical staining . Peritoneal microvascular density ( MVD ) was counted . Within 6 weeks after commencing peritoneal dialysis , a standard peritoneal equilibration test was performed , and the dialysate-to-plasma concentration ratio for creatinine at 4 h ( D4/P Cr ) was determined . The patients were divided into two groups based on the D4/P Cr : more than 0.65 ( Group H , n = 22 ) and less than or equal to 0.65 ( Group L , n = 14 ) . The 24-h peritoneal protein excretion ( PPE ) was assayed . Flt-1 and Flk-1 were correlated with peritoneal MVD , D4/P Cr , and PPE . RESULTS Flt-1 and Flk-1 were detected in the peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients . Flt-1 expression was similar between the two groups , but Flk-1 expression in Group H was significantly higher than that in Group L ( p = 0.001 ) . Flt-1 expression did not show significant correlations with peritoneal MVD , D4/P Cr , and PPE . However , Flk-1 expression showed significant correlations with the above three parameters ( p < 0.001 for all ) . CONCLUSIONS For the first time , the expressions of Flt-1 and Flk-1 in peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients were detected . Flk-1 expression in peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients is closely correlated with the number of peritoneal microvessels , peritoneal small solute transport rate , and PPE . Our findings strongly suggest that Flk-1 may be a crucial determinant of baseline peritoneal transport characteristics . Further interventional studies are needed .
Surgery is the most effective therapy for cancer in the United States , but disease still recurs in more than 40% of patients within 5 years after resection . Chemotherapy is given postoperatively to prevent relapses ; however , this approach has had marginal success . After surgery , recurrent tumors depend on rapid neovascular proliferation to deliver nutrients and oxygen . Phosphatidylserine ( PS ) is exposed on the vascular endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment but is notably absent on blood vessels in normal tissues . Thus , PS is an attractive target for cancer therapy after surgery . Syngeneic mice bearing TC1 lung cancer tumors were treated with mch1N11 ( a novel mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets PS ) , cisplatin ( cis ) , or combination after surgery . Tumor relapses and disease progression were decreased 90% by combination therapy compared with a 50% response rate for cis alone ( P = .02 ) . Mice receiving postoperative mch1N11 had no wound-related complications or added systemic toxicity in comparison to control animals . Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the effects of mch1N11 were associated with a dense infiltration of inflammatory cells , particularly granulocytes . This strategy was independent of the adaptive immune system . Together , these data suggest that vascular-targeted strategies directed against exposed PS may be a powerful adjunct to postoperative chemotherapy in preventing relapses after cancer surgery .
PURPOSE Precise monitoring of active angiogenesis in neovascular eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) enables sensitive use of antiangiogenic drugs and reduces adverse side effects . So far , no in vivo imaging methods are available to specifically label active angiogenesis . Here , we report such a technique using fluorophore-labeled cationic liposomes ( CL ) detected with a standard clinical in vivo scanning laser ophthalmoscope ( SLO ) . METHODS C57Bl/6 mice underwent laser coagulations at day 0 ( d0 ) to induce choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) . Liposomes labeled with Oregon green , rhodamine ( Rh ) , or indocyanine green ( ICG ) were injected into the tail vein at various time points after laser coagulation , and their fluorescence was observed in vivo 60 min later using an SLO , or afterwards in choroidal flatmounts or cryosections . RESULTS SLO detected accumulated fluorescence only in active CNV lesions with insignificant background noise . The best signal was obtained with CL-ICG . Choroidal flatmounts and cryosections of the eye confirmed the location of retained CL in CNV lesions . Neutral liposomes , in contrast , showed no accumulation . CONCLUSIONS These results establish fluorophore-labeled CL as high affinity markers to selectively stain active CNV . This novel , non-invasive SLO imaging technique could improve risk assessment and indication for current intraocular antiangiogenic drugs in neovascular eye diseases , as well as monitor therapeutic outcomes . Labeling of angiogenic vessels using CL can be of interest not only for functional imaging in ophthalmology but also for other conditions where localization of active angiogenesis is desirable .
OBJECTIVE Angiogenesis represents a key element in the pathogenesis of malignancy . There are no robust data on prognostic factors for overall survival ( OS ) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-targeted therapy . The present study was conducted to establish a prognostic model for patients using an oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer . METHODS Baseline characteristics and outcomes on 170 patients treated with FOLFIRI or XELOX plus anti-VEGF therapy-naive metastatic colorectal cancer were collected from three Turkey cancer centers . Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent prognostic factors for OS . RESULTS The median OS for the whole cohort was 19 months ( 95% CI , 14.3 to 23.6 months ) . Three of the seven adverse prognostic factors according to the Anatolian Society of Medical Oncology ( ASMO ) were independent predictors of short survival : serum lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) greater than the upper limit of normal ( ULN ; p<0.001 ) ; neutrophils greater than the ULN ( p<0.0014 ) ; and progression free survival ( PFS ) less than 6 months ( p =0.001 ) . CONCLUSION Serum LDH and neutrophil levels were the main prognostic factors in predicting survival , followed by PFS . This model validates incorporation of components of the ASMO model into patient care and clinical trials that use VEGF-targeting agents .
OBJECTIVE Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is a highly vascularized tumor in which neoangiogenesis contributes to growth and metastasis . We assessed the safety , efficacy , and potential biomarkers of activity of bevacizumab in patients with advanced HCC . METHODS In this phase II trial , eligible patients received bevacizumab , 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks . The disease-control rate at 16 weeks ( 16W-DCR ) was the primary endpoint . Circulating endothelial cells ( CECs ) and plasma cytokines and angiogenic factors ( CAFs ) were measured at baseline and throughout treatment . RESULTS The 16W-DCR was 42% ( 95% confidence interval , 27%-57% ) . Six of the 43 patients who received bevacizumab achieved a partial response ( objective response rate [ ORR ] , 14% ) . Grade 3-4 asthenia , hemorrhage , and aminotransferase elevation occurred in five ( 12% ) , three ( 7% ) , and three ( 7% ) patients , respectively . During treatment , placental growth factor markedly increased , whereas vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A dramatically decreased ( p < .0001 ) ; soluble VEGF receptor-2 ( p < .0001 ) and CECs ( p = .03 ) transiently increased on day 3 . High and increased CEC counts at day 15 were associated with the ORR ( p = .04 ) and the 16W-DCR ( p = .02 ) , respectively . Lower interleukin ( IL)-8 levels at baseline ( p = .01 ) and throughout treatment ( p <= .04 ) were associated with the 16W-DCR . High baseline IL-8 and IL-6 levels predicted shorter progression-free and overall survival times ( p <= .04 ) . CONCLUSION Bevacizumab is active and well tolerated in patients with advanced HCC . The clinical value of CECs , IL-6 , and IL-8 warrants further investigation .
Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) is one of the most important mediators of angiogenesis . Single-chain ( sc)-VEGF protein containing an N-terminal Cys-tag has been designed for site-specific modification with a variety of imaging and therapeutic moieties . Site-specific labeling of scVEGF with thiol-reactive prosthetic group , N-[2-(4-(18)F-fluorobenzamido) ethyl ] maleimide ( [ (18)F]FBEM ) for positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging of VEFGR may provide a new tracer which has great potential for clinical translation.Methods : [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF was synthesized by site-specific conjugation of ( 18)F-FBEM to a thiol group in Cys-tag of scVEGF at room temperature . The functional activity after labeling was tested by immunofluorescence staining , cellular uptake and efflux . The tumor targeting and in vivo properties were evaluated by biodistribution and microPET studies in tumor-bearing mice.Results : The radiolabeling yield and specific activity of [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF were 20.6 <FFFD> 15.1% ( based on starting [ (18)F]FBEM , uncorrected , n = 5 ) and 58.8 <FFFD> 12.4 GBq/<FFFD>mol , respectively . Noninvasive microPET and direct tissue sampling experiments demonstrated that [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF had VEGFR specific tumor uptake in MDA-MB-435 , U87MG and 4T1 xenograft models . The optimal tumor uptake was achieved at 2 h p.i. , which can be partially , but significantly blocked by co-injection of non-labeled scVEGF protein . Overall , [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF showed VEGFR specific tumor uptake.Conclusion : The scVEGF was site-specifically labeled with ( 18)F via [ (18)F]FBEM prosthetic group and the tracer [ (18)F]FBEM-scVEGF exhibited high receptor binding affinity and tumor targeting efficacy . Further study of [ (18)F ] FBEM-scVEGF to evaluate angiogenesis in cancer and other disease types is warranted .
Src kinase is elevated in breast tumors that are ER/PR negative and do not overexpress HER2 , but clinical trials with Src inhibitors have shown little activity . The present study evaluated preclinical efficacy of a novel peptidomimetic compound , KX-01 ( KX2-391 ) , that exhibits dual action as an Src and pretubulin inhibitor . KX-01 was evaluated as a single-agent and in combination with paclitaxel in MDA-MB-231 , MDA-MB-157 , and MDA-MB-468 human ER/PR/HER2-negative breast cancer cells . Treatments were evaluated by growth/apoptosis , isobologram analysis , migration/invasion assays , tumor xenograft volume , metastasis , and measurement of Src , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , microtubules , Ki67 , and microvessel density . KX-01 inhibited cell growth in vitro and in combination with paclitaxel resulted in synergistic growth inhibition . KX-01 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 tumor xenografts ( 1 and 5 mg/kg , twice daily ) . KX-01 inhibited activity of Src and downstream mediator FAK in tumors that was coincident with reduced proliferation and angiogenesis and increased apoptosis . KX01 also resulted in microtubule disruption in tumors . Combination of KX-01 with paclitaxel resulted in significant regression of MDA-MB-231 tumors and reduced metastasis to mouse lung and liver . KX-01 is a potently active Src/pretubulin inhibitor that inhibits breast tumor growth and metastasis . As ER/PR/HER2-negative patients are candidates for paclitaxel therapy , combination with KX-01 may potentiate antitumor efficacy in management of this aggressive breast cancer subtype .
MicroRNAs ( miRs ) are small non-coding RNAs that recently emerged as potent regulators of gene expression . The members of the miR-17-92 cluster have been shown to control endothelial cell functions and neovascularization ; however , the regulation and function of the cluster in endothelial cell lineage commitment has not been explored . This project aimed to test the role of the miR-17-92 cluster during endothelial differentiation . We demonstrate that miR-17 , miR-18 , miR-19 and miR-20 are increased upon the induction of endothelial cell differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells . In contrast , miR-92a and the primary miR-17-92 transcript were downregulated . The inhibition of each individual miR of the cluster by cholesterol-modified antagomirs did not affect endothelial marker gene expression . Moreover , the combination of all antagomirs had no effect . These findings illustrate that although the miR-17-92 cluster regulates vascular integrity and angiogenesis , none of the members has a significant impact on the endothelial differentiation of pluripotent stem cells .
Angiogenesis is critical for cancer growth and metastasis . Steps of angiogenesis are energy consuming , while vascular endothelial cells are highly glycolytic . Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) is a highly vascular tumor and this enhances its aggressiveness . D-amino acid oxidase ( DAO ) is a promising therapeutic protein that induces oxidative stress upon acting on its substrates . Oxidative stress-energy depletion ( OSED ) therapy was recently reported ( El Sayed et al. , Cancer Gene Ther , 19 , 1-18 , 2012 ) . OSED combines DAO-induced oxidative stress with energy depletion caused by glycolytic inhibitors such as 3-bromopyruvate ( 3BP ) , a hexokinase II inhibitor that depleted ATP in cancer cells and induced production of hydrogen peroxide. 3BP disturbs the Warburg effect and antagonizes effects of lactate and pyruvate ( El Sayed et al. , J Bioenerg Biomembr , 44 , 61-79 , 2012 ) . Citrate is a natural organic acid capable of inhibiting glycolysis by targeting phosphofructokinase . Here , we report that DAO , 3BP and citrate significantly inhibited angiogenesis , decreased the number of vascular branching points and shortened the length of vascular tubules . OSED delayed the growth of C6/DAO glioma cells. 3BP combined with citrate delayed the growth of C6 glioma cells and decreased significantly the number and size of C6 glioma colonies in soft agar . Human GBM cells ( U373MG ) were resistant to chemotherapy e.g. cisplatin and cytosine arabinoside , while 3BP was effective in decreasing the viability and disturbing the morphology of U373MG cells .
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the Expression and correlation of cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGF ) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma . METHOD In this study , expression levels of COX-2 , VEGF were examined in 58 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 38 patients with inflammation in nasopharyngeal mucosa by immunohistochemistry method . RESULT The expression of COX-2 , VEGF were higher in nasopharyngeal carcinoma than those in nasopharyngeal mucosa ( P < 0.05 ) , and they had some correlation with the invasion and lymphatic metastasis and with the clinical stage of nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( P < 0.05 ) . The expression of COX-2 was positively correlated with that of VEGF ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION The coexpression of COX-2 and VEGF may play animportant role in the carcinogenesis and development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma , and they may prom ( see text ) lymph node metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma .
Epigenetic changes in pediatric neuroblastoma may contribute to the aggressive pathophysiology of this disease , but little is known about the basis for such changes . In this study , we examined a role for the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B , in particular , the truncated isoform DNMT3B7 , which is generated frequently in cancer . To investigate if aberrant DNMT3B transcripts alter DNA methylation , gene expression , and phenotypic character in neuroblastoma , we measured DNMT3B expression in primary tumors . Higher levels of DNMT3B7 were detected in differentiated ganglioneuroblastomas compared to undifferentiated neuroblastomas , suggesting that expression of DNMT3B7 may induce a less aggressive clinical phenotype . To test this hypothesis , we investigated the effects of enforced DNMT3B7 expression in neuroblastoma cells , finding a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo . DNMT3B7-positive cells had higher levels of total genomic methylation and a dramatic decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN family members that comprise AP1 transcription factors . Consistent with an established antagonistic relationship between AP1 expression and retinoic acid receptor activity , increased differentiation was seen in the DNMT3B7-expressing neuroblastoma cells following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) compared to controls . Our results indicate that DNMT3B7 modifies the epigenome in neuroblastoma cells to induce changes in gene expression , inhibit tumor growth , and increase sensitivity to ATRA .
Tumor cells are surrounded by infiltrating inflammatory cells , such as lymphocytes , neutrophils , macrophages , and mast cells . A body of evidence indicates that mast cells are associated with various types of tumors . Although role of mast cells can be directly related to their granule content , their function in angiogenesis and tumor progression remains obscure . This study aims to understand the role of mast cells in these processes . Tumors were chemically induced in BALB/c mice and tumor progression was divided into Phases I , II and III . Phase I tumors exhibited a large number of mast cells , which increased in phase II and remained unchanged in phase III . The expression of mouse mast cell protease ( mMCP)-4 , mMCP-5 , mMCP-6 , mMCP-7 , and carboxypeptidase A were analyzed at the 3 stages . Our results show that with the exception of mMCP-4 expression of these mast cell chymase ( mMCP-5 ) , tryptases ( mMCP-6 and 7 ) , and carboxypeptidase A ( mMC-CPA ) increased during tumor progression . Chymase and tryptase activity increased at all stages of tumor progression whereas the number of mast cells remained constant from phase II to III . The number of new blood vessels increased significantly in phase I , while in phases II and III an enlargement of existing blood vessels occurred . In vitro , mMCP-6 and 7 are able to induce vessel formation . The present study suggests that mast cells are involved in induction of angiogenesis in the early stages of tumor development and in modulating blood vessel growth in the later stages of tumor progression .
22Rv1 is a common prostate cancer cell line used in xenograft mouse experiments as well as in vitro cell culture assays to study aspects of prostate cancer tumorigenesis . Recently , this cell line was shown to harbor multiple copies of a gammaretrovirus , called XMRV , integrated in its genome . While the original prostate cancer xenograft CWR22 is free of any retrovirus , subsequently generated cell lines 22Rv1 and CWR-R1 , carry this virus and additionally shed infectious gammaretroviral particles in their supernatant . Although XMRV most likely was generated by recombination events in cell culture this virus has been demonstrated to infect human cells in vitro and 22Rv1 as well as CWR-R1 cells are now considered biosafety 2 reagents . Here , we demonstrate that 22Rv1 cells with reduced retroviral transcription show reduced tumor angiogenesis and increased necrosis of the primary tumor derived from xenografted cells in scid mice when compared to the parental cell line . The presence of XMRV transcripts significantly increases secretion of osteopontin ( OPN ) , CXCL14 , IL13 and TIMP2 in 22Rv1 cells . Furthermore , these data are supported by in vitro cell invasion and differentiation assays . Collectively , our data suggest that the presence of XMRV transcripts at least partially contributes to 22Rv1 characteristics observed in vitro and in vivo with regard to migration , invasion and tumor angiogenesis . We propose that data received with 22Rv1 cells or equivalent cells carrying xenotropic gammaretroviruses should be carefully controlled including other prostate cancer cell lines tested for viral sequences .
Placental Growth Factor ( PGF ) is a key molecule in angiogenesis . Several studies have revealed an important role of PGF primarily in pathological conditions ( e.g. : ischaemia , tumour formation , cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory processes ) suggesting its use as a potential therapeutic agent . However , to date , no information is available regarding the genetics of PGF variability . Furthermore , even though the effect of environmental factors ( e.g. : cigarette smoking ) on angiogenesis has been explored , no data on the influence of these factors on PGF levels have been reported so far . Here we have first investigated PGF variability in two cohorts focusing on non-genetic risk factors : a study sample from two isolated villages in the Cilento region , South Italy ( N=871 ) and a replication sample from the general Danish population ( N=1,812 ) . A significant difference in PGF mean levels was found between the two cohorts . However , in both samples , we observed a strong correlation of PGF levels with ageing and sex , men displaying PGF levels significantly higher than women . Interestingly , smoking was also found to influence the trait in the two populations , although differently . We have then focused on genetic risk factors . The association between five single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) located in the PGF gene and the plasma levels of the protein was investigated . Two polymorphisms ( rs11850328 and rs2268614 ) were associated with the PGF plasma levels in the Cilento sample and these associations were strongly replicated in the Danish sample . These results , for the first time , support the hypothesis of the presence of genetic and environmental factors influencing PGF plasma variability .
BACKGROUND Angiogenesis plays an important role in the progression of colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . Studies have indicated vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) is the predominant angiogenic factor . Cyclin D1 ( CCND1 ) induces production of VEGF and is required for migration of blood vessels . Our aim was to determine the roles of CCND1 and VEGF overexpression in CRC patients . METHODS We analyzed clinicopathological features , VEGF and CCND1 expressions by immunohistochemical ( IHC ) staining in 100 stage I-III CRC patients ( 44 were postoperative relapsed ; 56 were postoperative non-relapsed ) to determine the correlation between clinicopathologic features and co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF . Furthermore , the clinical outcomes of co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF were investigated . RESULTS Multivariate analysis showed vascular invasion ( P = 0.019 ) , VEGF overexpression ( P = 0.033 ) , and high postoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) levels ( P = 0.022 ) were independent predictors of postoperative relapse . Co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF overexpression had significantly poorer disease-free survival rates ( P = 0.004 ) and overall survival rates ( P = 0.001 ) than other phenotypes . CONCLUSIONS Co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF overexpression would potentially assist in TNM staging systems to predict the prognosis of these patients who would benefit from intensive follow-up and therapeutic programs .
Angiogenesis is defined as the formation of new blood vessels form existing vessels surrounding a tumor . The process of angiogenesis is an important step for tumor growth and metastasis , as is inflammation . Thus , angiogenesis inhibitors that suppress inflammation have been studied as an anticancer treatment . Recently , many research groups have investigated the anti-angiogenic activity of natural compounds since some have been demonstrated to have anticancer properties . Among many natural compounds , we focused on betaine , which is known to suppress inflammation . Betaine , trimethylglycine ( TMG ) , was first discovered in the juice of sugar beets and was later shown to be present in wheat , shellfish and spinach . In Southeast Asia , betaine is used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of hepatic disorders . Here , we report the anti-angiogenic action of betaine . Betaine inhibited invitro angiogenic cascade , tube formation , migration and invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . Betaine also inhibited invivo angiogenesis in the mouse Matrigel plug assay . The mRNA expression levels of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2 ) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) in HUVECs were decreased by betaine treatment . In addition , betaine suppressed NF-kappaB and Akt activation .
BACKGROUND Chemokines are involved in multiple aspects of pathogenesis and cellular trafficking in tumorigenesis . In this study , we report that the latest member of the C-X-C-type chemokines , CXCL17 ( DMC/VCC-1 ) , recruits immature myeloid-derived cells and enhances early tumor progression . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS CXCL17 was preferentially expressed in some aggressive types of gastrointestinal , breast , and lung cancer cells . CXCL17 expression did not impart NIH3T3 cells with oncogenic potential in vitro , but CXCL17-expressing NIH3T3 cells could form vasculature-rich tumors in immunodeficient mice . Our data showed that CXCL17-expressing tumor cells increased immature CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid-derived cells at tumor sites in mice and promoted CD31(+) tumor angiogenesis . Extensive chemotactic assays proved that CXCL17-responding cells were CD11b(+)Gr1(high)F4/80(-) cells ( =~ 90% ) with a neutrophil-like morphology in vitro . Although CXCL17 expression could not increase the number of CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cells in tumor-burdened SCID mice or promote metastases of low metastatic colon cancer cells , the existence of CXCL17-responding myeloid-derived cells caused a striking enhancement of xenograft tumor formation . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These results suggest that aberrant expression of CXCL17 in tumor cells recruits immature myeloid-derived cells and promotes tumor progression through angiogenesis .
OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in cervical squamous carcinoma . METHODS Eighty cases of invasive cervical squamous cancer were selected as objects of our study . Double immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 and Ki-67 was used to label the lymphatic vessels and mark the proliferative lymphatic vessels in cervical squamous cancer . The peritumoral lymphatic vessel density and intratumoral lymphatic vessel density was assessed . The lymphatic vessels proliferation index was evaluated by calculating Ki-67 proliferation index ( PI ) to reflect the lymphangiogenesis of cervical squamous cancer . Then the correlation between lymphangiogenesis and clinicopathologic features of cervical squamous cancer was analyzed . RESULTS The LVD of cervical cancer ( 15.23 <FFFD> 3.6 ) was clearly higher than that of the adjacent normal cervical subepithelial tissues ( 9.9 <FFFD> 2.5 , P < 0.001 ) . The peritumoral lymphatic vessel density of cervical cancer ( 18.75 <FFFD> 4.3 ) was significantly higher than the intratumoral lymphatic vessel density of cervical cancer ( 11.71 <FFFD> 4.9 , P < 0.001 ) . Lymphatic PI ( LPI ) of cervical cancer ( 0.258 <FFFD> 0.07 ) was higher than that of the adjacent normal cervical subepithelial tissues ( 0.068 <FFFD> 0.08 , P < 0.001 ) . The peritumoral lymphatic vessel PI of cervical cancer ( 0.324 <FFFD> 0.06 ) was notably higher than the intratumoral lymphatic vessel PI of cervical cancer ( 0.232 <FFFD> 0.06 , P < 0.001 ) . Peritumoral lymphatic vessel density and peritumoral lymphatic vessel were clearly associated with the lymph node metastasis ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.002 , respectively ) and lymphovascular space invasion ( P = 0.024 and P = 0.01 , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS The high density of peritumoral lymphatic vessels is a potential predictor of more aggressive phenotype of cervical squamous cancer .
Despite insights into the molecular pathways regulating hypoxia-induced gene expression , it is not known which cell types accomplish oxygen sensing during neo-vasculogenesis . We have developed a humanized mouse model of endothelial and mesenchymal progenitor co-transplantation to delineate the cellular compartments responsible for hypoxia response during vasculogenesis . Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells ( MSPCs ) accumulated nuclear hypoxia-inducible transcription factor ( HIF)-1alpha earlier and more sensitively than endothelial colony forming progenitor cells ( ECFCs ) in vitro and in vivo . Hypoxic ECFCs showed reduced function in vitro and underwent apoptosis within 24h in vivo when used without MSPCs . Surprisingly , only in MSPCs did pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of HIF-1alpha abrogate neo-vasculogenesis . HIF deletion in ECFCs caused no effect . ECFCs could be rescued from hypoxia-induced apoptosis by HIF-competent MSPCs resulting in the formation of patent perfused human vessels . Several angiogenic factors need to act in concert to partially substitute mesenchymal HIF-deficiency . Results demonstrate that ECFCs require HIF-competent vessel wall progenitors to initiate vasculogenesis in vivo and to bypass hypoxia-induced apoptosis . We describe a novel mechanistic role of MSPCs as oxygen sensors promoting vasculogenesis thus underscoring their importance for the development of advanced cellular therapies .
Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is classically illustrated by a desynchronized cytokine system with rise in inflammatory cytokines . There are recent reports which emphasized the potential role of angiogenesis in the development of MM. Role of cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX-2 ) is well documented in the pathogenesis of solid tumors , but little is known about its occurrence and function in hematologic neoplasms . Involvement of neoangiogenesis is reported in the progression of MM , and angiopoietins probably contribute to this progression by enhancing neovascularization . Circulatory and mRNA levels of angiogenic factors and cyclooxygenase were determined in 125 subjects ( 75 MM patients and 50 healthy controls ) by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative PCR . We observed significant increase for angiogenic factors ( Ang-1 , Ang-2 , hepatocyte growth factor , and vascular endothelial growth factor ) and cyclooxygenase at circulatory level , as well as at mRNA level , as compared to healthy controls except insignificant increase for Ang-1 at circulatory level . We have also observed the significant positive correlation of all angiogenic factors with cyclooxygenase . The strong association found between angiogenic factors and COX-2 in this study may lead to the development of combination therapeutic strategy to treat MM. Therefore , targeting COX-2 by using its effective inhibitors demonstrating antiangiogenic and antitumor effects could be used as a new therapeutic approach for treatment of MM .
Formononetin is a novel herbal isoflavonoid isolated from Astragalus membranaceus , a medicinal plant that possesses antitumorigenic properties . Our previous findings demonstrated that formononetin initiates growth-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic activities in human colon cancer cells . In the present study , we aimed to further examine the potential of formononetin in controlling angiogenesis and tumor cell invasiveness in human colon cancer cells and tumor xenografts . The results showed that formononetin downregulated the expression of the key pro-angiogenic factors , including vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and matrix metalloproteinases . We also discovered that the invasiveness of metastatic colon cancer cells was alleviated following drug treatment . The potential anti-angiogenic effect of formononetin was examined in nude mouse xenografts . The tumor size and the number of proliferating cells were reduced in the tumor tissues obtained from the formononetin-treated group . The serum VEGF level was also reduced in the drug-treated animals when compared to the controls . These findings suggest that formononetin inhibits angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion , and thus support its use in the treatment of advanced and metastatic colon cancers .
BACKGROUND Angiogenic factors following oncological surgery is important in tumor recurrence . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , angiopoietin 1 ( Ang-1 ) , Ang-2 , soluble VEGF-receptor 1 ( sVEGFR1 ) and sVEGFR2 may influence angiogenesis . This prospective study examined the influence of open and video-assisted thoracic surgery ( VATS ) lung resections for early stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) on postoperative circulating angiogenic factors . METHODS Forty-three consecutive patients underwent major lung resection through either VATS ( n = 23 ) or Open thoracotomy ( n = 20 ) over an 8-month period . Blood samples were collected preoperatively and postoperatively on days ( POD ) 1 and 3 for enzyme linked immunosorbent assay determination of angiogenic factors . RESULTS Patient demographics were comparable . For all patients undergoing major lung resection , postoperative Ang-1 and sVEGFR2 levels were significantly decreased , while Ang-2 and sVEGFR1 levels markedly increased . No significant peri-operative changes in VEGF levels were observed . Compared with open group , VATS had significantly lower plasma levels of VEGF ( VATS 170 +/- 93 pg/mL ; Open 486 +/- 641 pg/mL ; P = 0.04 ) and Ang-2 ( VATS 2484 +/- 1119 pg/mL ; Open 3379 +/- 1287 pg/mL ; P = 0.026 ) on POD3 . CONCLUSIONS Major lung resection for early stage NSCLC leads to a pro-angiogenic status , with increased Ang-2 and decreased Ang-1 productions . VATS is associated with an attenuated angiogenic response with lower circulating VEGF and Ang-2 levels compared with open . Such differences in angiogenic factors may be important in lung cancer biology and recurrence following surgery .
The complement system contributes to various immune and inflammatory diseases , including cancer . In this study , we investigated the capacity of lung cancer cells to activate complement and characterized the consequences of complement activation on tumor progression . We focused our study on the production and role of the anaphylatoxin C5a , a potent immune mediator generated after complement activation . We first measured the capacity of lung cancer cell lines to deposit C5 and release C5a . C5 deposition , after incubation with normal human serum , was higher in lung cancer cell lines than in nonmalignant bronchial epithelial cells . Notably , lung malignant cells produced complement C5a even in the absence of serum . We also found a significant increase of C5a in plasma from patients with non-small cell lung cancer , suggesting that the local production of C5a is followed by its systemic diffusion . The contribution of C5a to lung cancer growth in vivo was evaluated in the Lewis lung cancer model . Syngeneic tumors of 3LL cells grew slower in mice treated with an antagonist of the C5a receptor . C5a did not modify 3LL cell proliferation in vitro but induced endothelial cell chemotaxis and blood-vessels formation . C5a also contributed to the immunosuppressive microenvironment required for tumor growth . In particular , blockade of C5a receptor significantly reduced myeloid-derived suppressor cells and immunomodulators ARG1 , CTLA-4 , IL-6 , IL-10 , LAG3 , and PDL1 ( B7H1 ) . In conclusion , lung cancer cells have the capacity to generate C5a , a molecule that creates a favorable tumor microenvironment for lung cancer progression .
Perlecan Domain V ( DV ) promotes brain angiogenesis by inducing VEGF release from brain endothelial cells ( BECs ) following stroke . In this study , we define the specific mechanism of DV interaction with the alpha(5)beta(1) integrin , identify the downstream signal transduction pathway , and further investigate the functional significance of resultant VEGF release . Interestingly , we found that the LG3 portion of DV , which has been suggested to possess most of DV's angio-modulatory activity outside of the brain , binds poorly to alpha(5)beta(1) and induces less BEC proliferation compared to full length DV . Additionally , we implicate DV's DGR sequence as an important element for the interaction of DV with alpha(5)beta(1) . Furthermore , we investigated the importance of AKT and ERK signaling in DV-induced VEGF expression and secretion . We show that DV increases the phosphorylation of ERK , which leads to subsequent activation and stabilization of eIF4E and HIF-1alpha . Inhibition of ERK activity by U0126 suppressed DV-induced expression and secretion of VEGR in BECs . While DV was capable of phosphorylating AKT we show that AKT phosphorylation does not play a role in DV's induction of VEGF expression or secretion using two separate inhibitors , LY294002 and Akt IV . Lastly , we demonstrate that VEGF activity is critical for DV increases in BEC proliferation , as well as angiogenesis in a BEC-neuronal co-culture system . Collectively , our findings expand our understanding of DV's mechanism of action on BECs , and further support its potential as a novel stroke therapy .
BACKGROUND Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive form of malignant glioma and is very difficult to treat . Controlling tumour cell invasion and angiogenesis is essential to improve the prognosis of glioblastoma patients . Since constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) is necessary for tumour progression , NF-kappaB may be an important pharmacological target for this disease . Our study aimed to evaluate the antitumour effects of parthenolide , a NF-kappaB inhibitor , in two human glioblastoma cell lines ( U87MG and U373 ) and in glioblastoma xenografts . Furthermore , we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects . METHODS The anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic effects of parthenolide were analysed using in vitro invasion and angiogenesis assays . Parthenolide-induced growth inhibition of glioblastoma cells in vitro was determined using the MTT ( methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ) assay . In addition , the effect of parthenolide on orthotropic implantation in vivo was evaluated using an intracerebral human glioblastoma xenograft model . RESULTS We found that parthenolide suppresses proliferation , invasion , and tumour- induced angiogenesis of glioblastoma cells . Molecular studies demonstrated that parthenolide suppresses gene and protein expression of angiogenic factors . Furthermore , parthenolide reduced Akt phosphorylation and activated mitochondrial signalling , suggesting that the antitumour function of parthenolide may be mediated not only by the inhibition of NF-kappaB but also by the inhibition of Akt signalling and the activation of apoptotic proteins . Parthenolide suppressed neovascularity and tumour growth in glioblastoma xenografts . CONCLUSION The present study identified parthenolide as a new therapeutic agent for glioblastomas .
The recent approval of a prostate cancer vaccine has renewed hope for anticancer immunotherapies . However , the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment may limit the effectiveness of current immunotherapies . Antiangiogenic agents have the potential to modulate the tumor microenvironment and improve immunotherapy , but they often are used at high doses in the clinic to prune tumor vessels and paradoxically may compromise various therapies . Here , we demonstrate that targeting tumor vasculature with lower vascular-normalizing doses , but not high antivascular/antiangiogenic doses , of an anti-VEGF receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) antibody results in a more homogeneous distribution of functional tumor vessels . Furthermore , lower doses are superior to the high doses in polarizing tumor-associated macrophages from an immune inhibitory M2-like phenotype toward an immune stimulatory M1-like phenotype and in facilitating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell tumor infiltration . Based on this mechanism , scheduling lower-dose anti-VEGFR2 therapy with T-cell activation induced by a whole cancer cell vaccine therapy enhanced anticancer efficacy in a CD8(+) T-cell-dependent manner in both immune-tolerant and immunogenic murine breast cancer models . These findings indicate that vascular-normalizing lower doses of anti-VEGFR2 antibody can reprogram the tumor microenvironment away from immunosuppression toward potentiation of cancer vaccine therapies . Given that the combinations of high doses of bevacizumab with chemotherapy have not improved overall survival of breast cancer patients , our study suggests a strategy to use antiangiogenic agents in breast cancer more effectively with active immunotherapy and potentially other anticancer therapies .
Alteration of the oxidative stress of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells can influence the expressions of genes favored angiogenesis . Quinone reductase 2 which can activate quinones leading to reactive oxygen species production is a melatonin receptor known as MT3 . Prazosin prescribed for benign prostate hyperplasia and hypertension is a potent antagonist for MT3 . This study was to investigate the influence of therapeutic concentrations of prazosin ( 0.01 and 0.1muM ) on cell proliferation and differential expressions of CCL2 , CCL20 , CXCL6 , CXCL10 , IL8 and IL6 genes related to inflammation and/or oxidative stress in human HCC cell lines . Two HCC cell lines including one without susceptible to amphotericin B-induced oxidative stress ( cell line A ; HCC24/KMUH ) and one with this effect ( cell line B ; HCC38/KMUH ) were investigated by 0.01 and 0.1muM prazosin . The premixed WST-1 cell proliferation reagent was applied for proliferation assay . Differential expressions of genes were examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction . Our results showed that both 0.01 and 0.1muM prazosin did not influence cell proliferation in both cell lines . Both 0.01 and 0.1muM prazosin in cell line A and 0.01muM prazosin in cell line B did not cause differential expressions of tested genes . However , 0.1muM prazosin caused remarkable up-regulation of IL6 gene and slightly up-regulation of CCL2 gene in cell line B. In conclusion , high therapeutic concentration of prazosin can up-regulate angiogenic IL6 and CCL2 genes in human HCC cells susceptible to amphotericin B-induced oxidative stress . Clinical application of prazosin in patients with HCC should consider this possibility .
Purpose . The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a new PET tracer ( 64)Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDyK ) for imaging of tumor angiogenesis using gene expression of angiogenesis markers as reference and to estimate radiation dosimetry for humans . Procedures . Nude mice with human neuroendocrine tumor xenografts ( H727 ) were administered ( 64)Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDyK ) i.v. for study of biodistribution as well as for dynamic PET . Gene expression of angiogenesis markers integrin alpha(V) , integrin beta(3) , and VEGF-A were analyzed using QPCR and correlated to the tracer uptake in the tumors ( %ID/g ) . From biodistribution data human radiation-absorbed doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM . Results . Tumor uptake was 1.2%ID/g with strong correlations between gene expression and tracer uptake , for integrin alpha(V) R = 0.76 , integrin beta(3) R = 0.75 and VEGF-A R = 0.81 ( all P < 0.05 ) . The whole body effective dose for humans was estimated to be 0.038 and 0.029 mSv/MBq for females and males , respectively , with highest absorbed dose in bladder wall . Conclusion . ( 64)Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDyK ) is a promising new angiogenesis PET tracer with potential for human use .
Angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( AT1R ) promotes tumor invasion , migration , metastasis and angiogenesis . We explored the potential antitumor effects of AT1R antagonists in breast cancer . We found that angiotensin II promoted cell proliferation and upregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) in MCF-7 cells . Losartan downregulated the expression of VEGF-A in MCF-7 cells treated with angiotensin II . Candesartan downregulated the expression of VEGF-A in mice bearing MCF-7 xenografts and inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis . AT1R and VEGF-A expression correlated with increased microvascular density in 102 breast cancer patients . Our data suggest that AT1R antagonists might be useful to suppress breast cancer by inhibiting the angiotensin II .
Angiogenesis is a crucial step in the growth and metastasis of cancers , since it enables the growing tumor to receive oxygen and nutrients . Cancer prevention using natural products has become an integral part of cancer control . We studied the antiangiogenic activity of quercetin using ex vivo , in vivo and in vitro models . Rat aortic ring assay showed that quercetin at non-toxic concentrations significantly inhibited microvessel sprouting and exhibited a significant inhibition in the proliferation , migration , invasion and tube formation of endothelial cells , which are key events in the process of angiogenesis . Most importantly , quercetin treatment inhibited ex vivo angiogenesis as revealed by chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane assay ( CAM ) and matrigel plug assay . Western blot analysis showed that quercetin suppressed VEGF induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 and their downstream protein kinases AKT , mTOR , and ribosomal protein S6 kinase in HUVECs . Quercetin ( 20 mg/kg/d ) significantly reduced the volume and the weight of solid tumors in prostate xenograft mouse model , indicating that quercetin inhibited tumorigenesis by targeting angiogenesis . Furthermore , quercetin reduced the cell viability and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells , which were correlated with the downregulation of AKT , mTOR and P70S6K expressions . Collectively the findings in the present study suggest that quercetin inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis by targeting VEGF-R2 regulated AKT/mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway , and could be used as a potential drug candidate for cancer therapy .
Blockage of the metastasis process remains a significant clinical challenge , requiring innovative therapeutic approaches . For this purpose , molecules that inhibit matrix metalloproteinases activity or induce the expression of their natural inhibitor , the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) , are potentially interesting . In a previous study , we have shown that synthetic ligands binding to cell surface nucleolin/nucleophosmin and known as HB 19 for the lead compound and NucAnt 6L ( N6L ) for the most potent analog , inhibit both tumor growth and angiogenesis . Furthermore , they prevent metastasis in a RET transgenic mice model which develops melanoma . Here , we investigated the effect of N6L on the invasion capacity of MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells . Our results show that the multivalent pseudopeptide N6L inhibited Matrigel invasion of MDA-MB-435 cells in a modified Boyden chamber model . This was associated with an increase in TIMP-3 in the cell culture medium without a change in TIMP-3 mRNA expression suggesting its release from cell surface and/or extracellular matrix . This may be explained by our demonstrated N6L interaction with sulfated glycosaminoglycans and consequently the controlled bioavailability of glycosaminoglycan-bound TIMP-3 . The implication of TIMP-3 in N6L-induced inhibition of cell invasion was evidenced by siRNA silencing experiments showing that the loss of TIMP-3 expression abrogated the effect of N6L . The inhibition of tumor cell invasion by N6L demonstrated in this study , in addition to its previously established inhibitory effect on tumor growth and angiogenesis , suggests that N6L represents a promising anticancer drug candidate warranting further investigation .
Melittin ( 1 ) is a major polypeptide in honey bee venom that has been used traditionally against chronic inflammation and cancer . However , its molecular mechanism has not been determined . In this study , the antitumor effect of 1 was compared with that of NS398 , a cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitor , in vivo and in vitro . Subcutaneous injection of 1 at 0.5 and 5 mg/kg suppressed significantly vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A-transfected highly metastatic Lewis lung cancer ( VEGF-A-hm LLC ) tumor growth by 25% and 57% , respectively . Also , 1 inhibited significantly the number of vessels around VEGF-A-hm LLC cells . The results were superior to those obtained in the mice treated with NS398 . Compound 1 dose-dependently inhibited proliferation and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( VEGF-A-HUVECs ) , without affecting cell viability in native HUVECs . In addition , 1 decreased the expression of VEGF receptor-2 ( VEGFR-2 ) , COX-2 , and prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) in VEGF-A-transfected HUVECs . These effects were accompanied by a reduction of the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and c-jun N-terminal kinase , whereas it increased the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) . SB203580 abolished the downregulation of COX-2 and VEGFR-2 and the inhibition of cell proliferation by 1 . The antitumor activity of 1 may be associated with antiangiogenic actions via inhibiting VEGFR-2 and inflammatory mediators involved in the MAPK signaling pathway .
Molecular mechanisms involved in progression of clear-cell renal-cell carcinomas ( ccRCCs ) are poorly understood . A common genetic mutation found in ccRCC is the loss of the von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) gene , which contributes to cancer progression and metastasis . We investigated VIP effects on metastatic and angiogenic factors in human VHL-null A498 ccRCC and HK2 renal cells . VIP increased adhesion but decreased expression of metalloproteinases , MMP2 and MMP9 , as well as cell migration and VEGF expression and secretion in A498 but not in HK2 cells . VIP enhanced ROS levels and decreased nuclear levels of beta-catenin and NFkappaB p50-subunit in A498 cells , suggesting neuropeptide involvement in the observed decrease of metastatic ability in clear-cell carcinoma . VIP effects in A498 cells were blocked by the VPAC(1/2)-receptor antagonist JV-1-53 . In conclusion , present data point to a role of VIP in preventing invasion and metastasis in ccRCCs and support its potential therapeutic usefulness in this disease .
Angiogenesis is the process of new blood vessel formation from pre-existing ones . Angiogenic factors contribute to neovascularization that takes place in angiogenesis-dependent diseases , including cancer . Inhibiting the activity of the angiogenic factors to block the angiogenesis pathways is the current strategy of cancer therapy . Basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) is regarded as one of the most important angiogenic factors . Herein , we selected polyoxometalates ( POMs ) with different structures to study the interactions between bFGF and POMs . The results show that POMs could bind to the protein with high affinity , causing detectable changes in conformation and biophysical properties of protein . In addition , POMs could effectively inhibit the cell proliferation induced by bFGF . Significantly , we found that the structure , size and composition of POMs play a key role in the interactions between bFGF and POMs . This study will be meaningful for future screening and design of polyoxometalate-based anticancer drugs .
A prominent feature of inflammatory diseases is endothelial dysfunction . Factors associated with endothelial dysfunction include proinflammatory cytokines , adhesion molecules , and matrix degrading enzymes . At the transcriptional level , they are regulated by the histone deacetylase sirtuin ( SIRT ) 1 via its actions on the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) . The role of SIRT6 , also a histone deacetylase , in regulating inflammation in endothelial cells is not known . The aim of this study was to determine the effect of SIRT6 knockdown on inflammatory markers in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) in the presence of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . LPS decreased expression of SIRT6 in HUVECs . Knockdown of SIRT6 increased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-1beta , IL-6 , IL-8 ) , COX-prostaglandin system , ECM remodelling enzymes ( MMP-2 , MMP-9 and PAI-1 ) , the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 , and proangiogenic growth factors VEGF and FGF-2 ; cell migration ; cell adhesion to leukocytes . Loss of SIRT6 increased the expression of NF-kappaB , whereas overexpression of SIRT6 was associated with decreased NF-kappaB transcriptional activity . Taken together , these results demonstrate that the loss of SIRT6 in endothelial cells is associated with upregulation of genes involved in inflammation , vascular remodelling , and angiogenesis . SIRT6 may be a potential pharmacological target for inflammatory vascular diseases .
OBJECT A considerable body of evidence indicates that inflammation and angiogenesis play a significant role in the development and progression of chronic subdural hematoma ( CSDH ) . While various experimental and clinical studies have implicated placental growth factor ( PlGF ) in the processes that underpin pathological angiogenesis , no study has thus far investigated its expression in CSDH . The actions of PlGF and its related proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) are antagonized by a high-affinity soluble receptor , namely soluble VEGF receptor-1 ( sVEGFR-1 ) , and thus the ratio between sVEGFR-1 and angiogenic factors provides an index of angiogenic capacity . METHODS In the present study , using an automated electrochemiluminescence assay , levels of PlGF and sVEGFR-1 were quantified in serum and hematoma fluid obtained in 16 patients with CSDH . RESULTS Levels of PlGF and sVEGFR-1 were significantly higher in hematoma fluid than in serum ( p < 0.0001 ) . In serum , levels of sVEGFR-1 were higher than those of PlGF ( p < 0.0001 ) , whereas in hematoma fluid this difference was not apparent . Furthermore , the ratio of sVEGFR-1 to PlGF was significantly lower in hematoma fluid than in serum ( p < 0.0001 ) . CONCLUSIONS Given previous evidence indicating a role for PlGF in promoting angiogenesis , inflammatory cell chemotaxis , and stimulation , as well as its ability to amplify VEGF-driven signaling under conditions favoring pathological angiogenesis , enhanced expression of PlGF in hematoma fluid suggests the involvement of this factor in the mechanisms of inflammation and angiogenesis in CSDH . Furthermore , a reduced ratio of sVEGFR-1 to PlGF in hematoma fluid is consistent with the proangiogenic capacity of CSDH . Future studies are warranted to clarify the precise role of PlGF and sVEGFR-1 in CSDH .
Tumor development requires angiogenesis and anti-angiogenic therapies have been introduced in the treatment of cancer . In this context , heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( HSPGs ) emerge as interesting targets , owing to their function as co-receptors of major , pro-angiogenic factors . Accordingly , previous studies have suggested anti-tumor effects of heparin , i.e. over-sulfated HS , and various heparin mimetics ; however , a significant drawback is their unspecific mechanism of action and potentially serious side-effects related to their anticoagulant properties . Here , we have explored the use of human ScFv anti-HS antibodies ( alphaHS ) as a more rational approach to target HSPG function in endothelial cells ( ECs). alphaHS were initially selected for their recognition of HS epitopes localized preferentially to the vasculature of patient glioblastoma tumors , i.e. highly angiogenic brain tumors . Unexpectedly , we found that these alphaHS exhibited potent pro-angiogenic effects in primary human ECs. alphaHS were shown to stimulate EC differentiation , which was associated with increased EC tube formation and proliferation . Moreover , alphaHS supported EC survival under hypoxia and starvation , i.e. conditions typical of the tumor microenvironment . Importantly , alphaHS-mediated proliferation was efficiently counter-acted by heparin and was absent in HSPG-deficient mutant cells , confirming HS-specific effects . On a mechanistic level , binding of alphaHS to HSPGs of ECs as well as glioblastoma cells was found to trigger p38 MAPK-dependent signaling resulting in increased proliferation . We conclude that several alphaHS that recognize HS epitopes abundant in the tumor vasculature may elicit a pro-angiogenic response , which has implications for the development of antibody-based targeting of HSPGs in cancer .
OBJECTIVE To study the mechanism of interleukin 7/interleukin 7 receptor ( IL-7/IL-7R ) in promoting cell proliferation and inducing lymphangiogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) in vivo and in vitro . METHODS Immunohistochemical study for IL-7 , IL-7R , cyclin D1 and vascular endothelial growth factor-D ( VEGF-D ) was carried out in NSCLC tissues from 95 patients . The relationship between IL-7/IL-7R expression and various parameters was analyzed . The mechanism of IL-7/IL-7R in promoting cell proliferation and inducing lymphangiogenesis was studied by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide , fluorescence-activated cell sorting , reverse transcriptase-PCR , Western blot , co-immunoprecipitation , chromatin immunoprecipitation and nude mice experiments with xenograft tumors . RESULTS IL-7 ( 63.2% , 60/95 ) , IL-7R ( 61.1% , 58/95 ) , cyclin D1 ( 52.6% , 50/95 ) and VEGF-D ( 58.9% , 56/95 ) showed that high level of expression in NSCLC . IL-7/IL-7R over-expression correlated with cyclin D1 expression ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.01 ) , VEGF-D expression ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.01 ) , increased lymphovascular density ( P = 0.005 , P = 0.013 ) , advanced clinical stage ( P = 0.008 , P = 0.005 ) and presence of lymph node metastasis ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.01 ) . IL-7/IL-7R could promote proliferation of A549 cell , increase cyclin D1 and VEGF-D expression , and enhance c-Fos/c-Jun expression and phosphorylation , resulting in formation of heterodimer . Furthermore , IL-7/IL-7R could induce binding of c-Fos/c-Jun to cyclin D1/VEGF-D promoters and regulate their transcription . IL-7/IL-7R could also promote proliferation and lymphangiogenesis of lung cancer xenograft tumors . CONCLUSIONS IL-7/IL-7R promotes c-Fos/c-Jun expression and activity in NSCLC . This further facilitates cyclin D1 expression and accelerates proliferation of cells and VEGF-D-induced lymphovascular formation .
BACKGROUND Thymidine phosphorylase ( TYMP ) is an angiogenic factor that has potent chemotactic activity for endothelial cells and is involved in 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) metabolism . In colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , previous studies evaluating the relationship between TYMP expression and clinicopathological features have yielded inconsistent results . The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of TYMP , its association with other angiogenic factors , proliferation markers and , to our knowledge , for the first time its relationship with extracellular matrix components . MATERIALS AND METHODS Formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded specimens from 97 patients with CRC were immunostained for TYMP , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , microvascular density ( CD34 ) , proliferation marker ( Ki-67 ) , proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) , p53 oncoprotein and extracellular matrix components ( collagen type IV , fibronectin , tenascin and laminin ) . Survival curves were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method . RESULTS Immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasm ( cyt ) and nucleus ( n ) of the tumor cells , as well in the stroma ( st ) , endothelium and tumor-associated macrophages . High TYMPcyt expression was observed in 7.2% of the cases , moderate in 22.7% and weak in 59.9% , while 10.3% were negative . High TYMPst expression was observed in 58.8% of the cases . TYMPcyt expression was correlated with the VEGF expression of tumor cells and VEGF expression of vessels ( p=0.014 and p=0.022 , respectively ) . TYMPst expression was correlated with VEGF expression and tenascin ( p=0.014 and p=0.011 , respectively ) . Patients with higher TYMPcyt expression had a more favorable overall survival ( p=0.041 ) in univariate analysis compared to patients without TYMP expression . CONCLUSION These findings suggest that TYMP plays an important role in angiogenesis , extracellular matrix remodeling and in the prognosis of patients with CRC , but further studies are needed to clearly define its role in CRC .
This study aimed to analyze the role of endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC)-derived angiogenic factors and chemokines in the multistep process driving angiogenesis with a focus on the recently discovered macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF)/chemokine receptor axis . Primary murine and murine embryonic EPCs ( eEPCs ) were analyzed for the expression of angiogenic/chemokines and components of the MIF/CXC chemokine receptor axis , focusing on the influence of hypoxic versus normoxic stimulation . Hypoxia induced an upregulation of CXCR2 and CXCR4 but not CD74 on EPCs and triggered the secretion of CXCL12 , CXCL1 , MIF , and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . These factors stimulated the transmigration activity and adhesive capacity of EPCs , with MIF and VEGF exhibiting the strongest effects under hypoxia . MIF- , VEGF- , CXCL12- , and CXCL1-stimulated EPCs enhanced tube formation , with MIF and VEGF exhibiting again the strongest effect following hypoxia . Tube formation following in vivo implantation utilizing angiogenic factor-loaded Matrigel plugs was only promoted by VEGF . Coloading of plugs with eEPCs led to enhanced tube formation only by CXCL12 , whereas MIF was the only factor which induced differentiation towards an endothelial and smooth muscle cell ( SMC ) phenotype , indicating an angiogenic and differentiation capacity in vivo . Surprisingly , CXCL12 , a chemoattractant for smooth muscle progenitor cells , inhibited SMC differentiation . We have identified a role for EPC-derived proangiogenic MIF , VEGF and MIF receptors in EPC recruitment following hypoxia , EPC differentiation and subsequent tube and vessel formation , whereas CXCL12 , a mediator of early EPC recruitment , does not contribute to the remodeling process . By discerning the contributions of key angiogenic chemokines and EPCs , these findings offer valuable mechanistic insight into mouse models of angiogenesis and help to define the intricate interplay between EPC-derived angiogenic cargo factors , EPCs , and the angiogenic target tissue .
AIM To investigate the role of delta-like ligand 4 ( DLL4 ) in the angiogenesis of high-grade malignant glioma . MATERIALS AND METHODS DLL4 expression and microvessel density ( MVD ) were detected by immunohistochemistry in 51 human high-grade malignant glioma tissue samples . The vessel maturation index ( VMI ) was calculated as the percentage of a-smooth muscle actin ( a-SMA)-positive vessels in relation to the amount of CD31-positive vessels . Double fluorescent immunostaining for CD31 and EphrinB2 or EphB4 was performed to identify the arterial ( EphrinB2 ) or venous ( EphB4 ) origins of glioma microvessels . RESULTS Strong immunostaining of DLL4 and a positive correlation of DLL4 with the MVD were observed in high-grade malignant gliomas . The VMI of the DLL4-positive group was significantly higher than that of the DLL4-negative group . However , no significant association was found between DLL4 and EphrinB2 or EphB4 in high-grade gliomas . CONCLUSION DLL4 may be an important regulator for vessel proliferation and maturation in human high-grade malignant gliomas .
The prediction of tumor behavior for patients with oral carcinomas remains a challenge for clinicians . The presence of lymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor but it is limited in predicting local relapse or survival . This highlights the need for identifying biomarkers that may effectively contribute to prediction of recurrence and tumor spread . In this study , we used one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis , mass spectrometry and immunodetection methods to analyze protein expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas . Using a refinement for classifying oral carcinomas in regard to prognosis , we analyzed small but lymph node metastasis-positive versus large , lymph node metastasis-negative tumors in order to contribute to the molecular characterization of subgroups with risk of dissemination . Specific protein patterns favoring metastasis were observed in the " more-aggressive " group defined by the present study . This group displayed upregulation of proteins involved in migration , adhesion , angiogenesis , cell cycle regulation , anti-apoptosis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition , whereas the " less-aggressive " group was engaged in keratinocyte differentiation , epidermis development , inflammation and immune response . Besides the identification of several proteins not yet described as deregulated in oral carcinomas , the present study demonstrated for the first time the role of cofilin-1 in modulating cell invasion in oral carcinomas .
The endothelial cell-specific microRNA ( miRNA ) , miR-126 , is considered a master regulator of physiological angiogenesis . Transplanted mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) release soluble factors contributing to neoangiogenesis and cardiac repair . Therefore , we hypothesized that the over-expression of miR-126 may prolong MSC survival and enhance the cell secretome , thereby improving post-infarction angiogenesis and cardiac function . In this study , MSCs harvested from male C57BL/6 mouse bone marrow were infected in vitro with miR-126 ( MSC(miR-126) ) by using recombinant lentiviral vectors ; the control cells were either non-transfected or transduced with mock vectors ( MSC(null) ) . The results showed an increased secretion of angiogenic factors and a higher resistance against hypoxia in MSC(miR-126) compared with the control cells . The expression of the Notch ligand Delta-like ( Dll)-4 in the MSC(miR-126) group was also increased . For in vivo experiments , MSC(miR-126) cultures were intramyocardially injected into the infarct region of the hearts of female C57BL/6 mice ( an acute myocardial infarction model ) who had undergone ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery . The survival of MSC(miR-126) cultures , determined by Sry expression , was increased at 7 days after transplantation . MSC(miR-126)-treated animals showed significantly improved cardiac function as assessed by echocardiography 2 weeks later . The expression levels of angiogenic factors and Dll-4 in the infarcted myocardium were further increased by MSC(miR-126) compared with MSCs or MSC(null) cultures . Furthermore , fluorescent microsphere and histological studies revealed that myocardial blood flow and microvessel density were significantly increased in the MSC(miR-126)-transplanted animals . In addition , we found increased immature vessel proliferation following the transplantation of MSC(miR-126) cultures in which the expression of Dll-4 had been knocked down . However , blood vessels with lumen were barely detected , which indicated that Dll-4 plays a key role in tubulogenesis . We conclude that the transplantation of MSCs overexpressing miR-126 can further enhance functional angiogenesis in the ischemic myocardium possibly by the secretion of angiogenic factors and the activation of Dll-4 , thus increasing MSC survival . Therefore , MSCs modified with miR-126 may represent a novel and efficient therapeutic approach for ischemic angiogenesis and the improvement of cardiac function .
Bigelovin is a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from the plant Inula helianthus-aquatica which was traditionally used in cancer treatment in Yunnan , China . The potent apoptotic activities of bigelovin in human leukemia U937 cells were shown in our previous study . The present study investigated the anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory effects of bigelovin using transgenic zebrafish Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 with fluorescent blood vessels and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) , respectively . Furthermore , the inhibitory activities of bigelovin on the human endothelial cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) were also examined . Our results showed that the growth of subintestinal vessels of the bigelovin-treated zebrafish embryos was significantly inhibited and the gene expressions in angiogenesis signaling pathways ( e.g . Ang2 and Tie2 ) of the zebrafish were down-regulated after bigelovin treatment . Besides , the proliferation and Th1 cytokines productions ( e.g . IFN-gamma , IL-2 and IL-12 ) were suppressed in bigelovin-treated PBMCs . On the other hand , bigelovin was shown to significantly inhibit the human monocyte adhesion to human endothelial cells and the gene expressions of inflammation-related CAMs ( e.g . ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 and E-selectin ) were significantly down-regulated in bigelovin-treated human endothelial cells . In summary , our data provide the first evidence that bigelovin possesses anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory activities , suggesting bigelovin may exert multi-target functions against cancer in animal models .
Adipose tissue growth and development are thought to be associated with angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling . Because ginseng has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activity , we hypothesized that adipose tissue growth and obesity can be regulated by Korean ginseng ( Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer ) . Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were fed for 8 weeks with a low fat diet , a high fat diet ( HFD ) , or HFD supplemented with 0.5% or 5% Korean red ginseng extract . We measured body weight , adipose tissue mass , food intake , MMP activity , and the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and MMPs . Administering ginseng to HFD-induced obese mice produced reductions in body weight and adipose tissue mass compared with untreated counterparts . Ginseng treatment decreased blood vessel density and MMP activity in adipose tissues . Ginseng also reduced mRNA levels of angiogenic factors ( e.g. , VEGF-A and FGF-2 ) and MMPs ( e.g. , MMP-2 and MMP-9 ) , whereas it increased mRNA levels of angiogenic inhibitors ( e.g. , TSP-1 , TIMP-1 , and TIMP-2 ) in adipose tissues . These results demonstrate that ginseng effectively reduces adipose tissue mass and prevents obesity in diet-induced obese mice and that this process may be mediated in part through the anti-angiogenic actions of ginseng .
Kaposi sarcoma is the most common neoplasm caused by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) . It is prevalent among the elderly in the Mediterranean , inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa , and immunocompromised individuals such as organ transplant recipients and AIDS patients . Current treatments for Kaposi sarcoma can inhibit tumor growth but are not able to eliminate KSHV from the host . When the host's immune system weakens , KSHV begins to replicate again , and active tumor growth ensues . New therapeutic approaches are needed . Cannabidiol ( CBD ) , a plant-derived cannabinoid , exhibits promising antitumor effects without inducing psychoactive side effects . CBD is emerging as a novel therapeutic for various disorders , including cancer . In this study , we investigated the effects of CBD both on the infection of endothelial cells ( ECs ) by KSHV and on the growth and apoptosis of KSHV-infected ECs , an in vitro model for the transformation of normal endothelium to Kaposi sarcoma . While CBD did not affect the efficiency with which KSHV infected ECs , it reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in those infected by the virus . CBD inhibited the expression of KSHV viral G protein-coupled receptor ( vGPCR ) , its agonist , the chemokine growth-regulated protein alpha ( GRO-alpha ) , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 ( VEGFR-3 ) , and the VEGFR-3 ligand , vascular endothelial growth factor C ( VEGF-C ) . This suggests a potential mechanism by which CBD exerts its effects on KSHV-infected endothelium and supports the further examination of CBD as a novel targeted agent for the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma .
There are many growth factors influencing the expansion of multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Angiogenesis is a process that may enhance MM growth , in various manners . Among them , insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) is a major factor , acting in many levels . The aim of the study was to measure serum levels of IGF-1 in newly diagnosed MM patients and to correlate them with clinical stage of the disease and with markers of angiogenesis , such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) , and interleukin-6 and 15 ( IL-6 and IL-15 ) . Serum levels of the above factors were measured , by ELISA , in 57 newly diagnosed MM patients and in 20 healthy controls . There was no difference in serum levels of IGF-1 in MM patients and in controls , contrary to angiogenic factors , which were higher in MM patients ( p < 0.001 ) . Similarly , IGF-1 did not correlate with clinical stage of the disease nor the other angiogenic factors , which also correlated with each other ( p < 0.001 ) . Serum IGF-1 concentrations are not influenced in MM patients . Therefore , although it is a proliferation cytokine , it cannot be used as marker of disease activity .
Hypoxia is known to play critical roles in cell survival , angiogenesis , tumor invasion , and metastasis . Hypoxia mediated over-expression of hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) has been shown to be associated with therapeutic resistance , and contributes to poor prognosis of cancer patients . Emerging evidence suggest that hypoxia and HIF pathways contributes to the acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , maintenance of cancer stem cell ( CSC ) functions , and also maintains the vicious cycle of inflammation-all which lead to therapeutic resistance . However , the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which hypoxia/HIF drives these events are not fully understood . Here , we show , for the first time , that hypoxia leads to increased expression of VEGF , IL-6 , and CSC signature genes Nanog , Oct4 and EZH2 consistent with increased cell migration/invasion and angiogenesis , and the formation of pancreatospheres , concomitant with increased expression of miR-21 and miR-210 in human pancreatic cancer ( PC ) cells . The treatment of PC cells with CDF , a novel synthetic compound inhibited the production of VEGF and IL-6 , and down-regulated the expression of Nanog , Oct4 , EZH2 mRNAs , as well as miR-21 and miR-210 under hypoxia . CDF also led to decreased cell migration/invasion , angiogenesis , and formation of pancreatospheres under hypoxia . Moreover , CDF decreased gene expression of miR-21 , miR-210 , IL-6 , HIF-1alpha , VEGF , and CSC signatures in vivo in a mouse orthotopic model of human PC . Collectively , these results suggest that the anti-tumor activity of CDF is in part mediated through deregulation of tumor hypoxic pathways , and thus CDF could become a novel , and effective anti-tumor agent for PC therapy .
Splenic haemangiosarcomas ( HSAs ) from 122 dogs were characterized and classified according to their patterns of growth , survival time post splenectomy , metastases and chemotherapy . The most common pattern of growth was a mixture of cavernous , capillary and solid tumour tissue . Survival time post splenectomy was independent of the growth pattern ; however , it was influenced by chemotherapy and metastases . Immunohistochemical assessment of the expression of angiogenic factors ( fetal liver kinase-1 , angiopoietin-2 , angiopoietin receptor-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor A ) and conventional endothelial markers ( CD31 , factor VIII-related antigen ) revealed variable expression , particularly in undifferentiated HSAs . Therefore , a combination of endothelial markers should be used to confirm the endothelial origin of splenic tumours .
Growth differentiation factor-15 ( GDF-15 ) and the CCN family member , connective tissue growth factor ( CCN2 ) , are associated with cardiac disease , inflammation and cancer . The precise role and signaling mechanism for these factors in normal and diseased tissues remains elusive . Here we demonstrate an interaction between GDF-15 and CCN2 using yeast two-hybrid assays and have mapped the domain of interaction to the von Willebrand factor type C domain of CCN2 . Biochemical pull down assays using secreted GDF-15 and His-tagged CCN2 produced in PC-3 prostate cancer cells confirmed a direct interaction between these proteins . To investigate the functional consequences of this interaction , in vitro angiogenesis assays were performed . We demonstrate that GDF-15 blocks CCN2-mediated tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial ( HUVEC ) cells . To examine the molecular mechanism whereby GDF-15 inhibits CCN2-mediated angiogenesis , activation of alpha(V) beta(3) integrins and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) was examined . CCN2-mediated FAK activation was inhibited by GDF-15 and was accompanied by a decrease in alpha(V) beta(3) integrin clustering in HUVEC cells . These results demonstrate , for the first time , a novel signaling pathway for GDF-15 through interaction with the matricellular signaling molecule CCN2 . Furthermore , antagonism of CCN2 mediated angiogenesis by GDF-15 may provide insight into the functional role of GDF-15 in disease states . J. Cell . Biochem. <FFFD> 2012 Wiley Periodicals , Inc .
Activation of p53 effectively inhibits tumor angiogenesis that is necessary for tumor growth and metastasis . Reactivation of the p53 by small molecules has emerged as a promising new strategy for cancer therapy . Several classes of small-molecules that activate the p53 pathway have been discovered using various approaches . Here , we identified harmine ( beta-carboline alkaloid ) as a novel activator of p53 signaling involved in inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth . Harmine induced p53 phosphorylation and disrupted the p53-MDM2 interaction . Harmine also prevented p53 degradation in the presence of cycloheximide and activated nuclear accumulation of p53 followed by increasing its transcriptional activity in endothelial cells . Moreover , harmine not only induced endothelial cell cycle arrest and apoptosis , but also suppressed endothelial cell migration and tube formation as well as induction of neovascularity in a mouse corneal micropocket assay . Finally , harmine inhibited tumor growth by reducing tumor angiogenesis , as demonstrated by a xenograft tumor model . Our results suggested a novel mechanism and bioactivity of harmine , which inhibited tumor growth by activating the p53 signaling pathway and blocking angiogenesis in endothelial cells .
Angiogenesis , the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vascular beds , is essential for tumor growth , invasion , and metastasis . Luteolin is a common dietary flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables . We studied the antiangiogenic activity of luteolin using in vitro , ex vivo , and in vivo models . In vitro studies using rat aortic ring assay showed that luteolin at non-toxic concentrations significantly inhibited microvessel sprouting and proliferation , migration , invasion and tube formation of endothelial cells , which are key events in the process of angiogenesis . Luteolin also inhibited ex vivo angiogenesis as revealed by chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane assay ( CAM ) and matrigel plug assay . Gelatin zymographic analysis demonstrated the inhibitory effect of luteolin on the activation of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 . Western blot analysis showed that luteolin suppressed VEGF induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 and their downstream protein kinases AKT , ERK , mTOR , P70S6K , MMP-2 , and MMP-9 in HUVECs . Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNF-alpha level were significantly reduced by the treatment of luteolin in PC-3 cells . Luteolin ( 10 mg/kg/d ) significantly reduced the volume and the weight of solid tumors in prostate xenograft mouse model , indicating that luteolin inhibited tumorigenesis by targeting angiogenesis . CD31 and CD34 immunohistochemical staining further revealed that the microvessel density could be remarkably suppressed by luteolin . Moreover , luteolin reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells , which were correlated with the downregulation of AKT , ERK , mTOR , P70S6K , MMP-2 , and MMP-9 expressions . Taken together , our findings demonstrate that luteolin inhibits human prostate tumor growth by suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-mediated angiogenesis .
We had demonstrated that plasminogen kringle 5 ( K5 ) , a potent angiogenic inhibitor , inhibited retinal neovascularization and hepatocellular carcinoma growth by anti-angiogenesis . The current study investigated the effects and the underlying mechanisms of K5 on both tumor growth and spontaneous pulmonary metastasis in Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) implanted mouse model . Similarly , K5 could decrease expression of VEGF in LLC cells and grafted tissues and suppress tumor angiogenesis and growth . K5 had no direct effect on proliferation and apoptosis of LLC . However , K5 could significantly inhibit SDF-1alpha-induced chemotaxis movement of LLC cells and resulted in a great reduction of surface metastatic nodules and micrometastases in the lungs of LLC tumor-bearing mice . K5 also decreased expression of chemokine ( C-X-C motif ) receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) in LLC cells and grafted tissues . Furthermore , K5 down-regulated SDF-1alpha expression in metastatic lung tissues of LLC-bearing mice . Therefore , K5 may suppress tumor pulmonary metastasis through inhibiting SDF-1alpha-CXCR4 chemotaxis movement and down-regulation of VEGF . Moreover , the role of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha ( HIF-1alpha ) , a crucial transcriptional factor for both VEGF and CXCR4 expression , was evaluated . The siRNA of HIF-1alpha attenuated expression of VEGF and CXCR4 and inhibited LLC migration . K5 decreased HIF-1alpha protein level and impaired nuclear HIF-1alpha accumulation . These results showed for the first time that K5 inhibits LLC growth and metastasis via the dual effects of anti-angiogenesis and suppression of tumor cell motility by targeting the pivotal molecule , HIF-1alpha .
OBJECTIVE The signalling molecule protein kinase B ( Akt ) modulates many cellular processes . Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K)/Akt signalling pathways play important roles in tumour angiogenesis . The aim of this study was to determine the role of phosphorylated Akt ( pAkt ) in angiogenesis and its correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A in gastric adenocarcinoma . METHODS Tumour tissue and matched healthy gastric mucosa were obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection of gastric adenocarcinoma . Akt and pAkt were detected via Western blotting . VEGF-A , pAkt and CD34 were examined by immunohistochemistry . RESULTS Akt and pAkt protein levels were significantly higher in gastric cancer tissue than in normal tissue ( n = 48 patients ) . Positive VEGF-A immunostaining was significantly associated with pAkt immunostaining . Microvessel density was correlated with both VEGF-A and pAkt positivity . CONCLUSIONS Phosphorylated Akt and VEGF-A are involved in angiogenesis of gastric adenocarcinoma , and Akt activation may contribute to angiogenesis via VEGF-A upregulation . The PI3K/Akt/VEGF signalling pathway may be involved in gastric adeno carcinoma .
BACKGROUND Angiogenesis is an essential process in cancer growth maintenance , and metastasis . Angiopoietin-2 promotes tumor angiogenesis by priming the vasculature and potentiating the effects of cytokines at the front of active neovascularization . Enhanced expression of angiopoietin-2 has been reported in lung cancer tissue . Survivin is one of the inhibitors of apoptosis protein that has been shown to play a key role in cancer progression , and in tumor angiogenesis . Also plays a key role in tumor cell resistance to anticancer agents and ionizing radiation . AIM To measure the serum levels of angiopoietin-2 and survivin as possible angiogenic factors in lung cancer patients with the assessment of their interrelationships and clinical significance . PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with lung cancer as NSCLC ( n=70 ) and healthy volunteers ( n=10 ) were enrolled . Serum angiopoietin-2 and survivin concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELIZA ) . RESULTS Median serum angiopoietin-2 levels with lung cancer ( 2730pg/mL ) ranged from 1171 to 6541pg/mL was higher than the median of the control group ( 1795pg/mL ) ranged from 1076 to 2730/mL , p<0.001 . Median serum survivin levels were also higher in patients with lung cancer ( 53.0pg/mL ) ranged from 39.3 to 96.3pg/mL than the median of the control group ( 48.8pg/mL ) ranged from 38.0 to 74.6pg/mL , but did not reach statistical significance p=0.206 . In all patients with lung cancer , serum angiopoietin-2 was not significantly correlated with survivin ( r=0.073 , p=0.657 ) . Neither serum angiopoietin-2 nor survivin showed significant relation with the serum angiopoietin-2 or survivin levels depending on the cell types , stage progression , and metastasis among the patients with NSCLC . CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that serum angiopoietin-2 is a useful marker for the diagnosis of NSCLC by ELIZA technique .
BACKGROUND Anti-angiogenic treatment of glioblastoma characteristically results in therapy resistance and tumor progression via diffuse infiltration . Monitoring tumor progression in these patients is thwarted because therapy results in tumor invisibility in contrast-enhanced ( CE ) MRI . To address this problem , we examined whether tumor progression could be monitored by metabolic mapping using ( 1)H MR spectroscopic imaging ( MRSI ) . METHODS We treated groups of BALB/c nu/nu mice carrying different orthotopic diffuse-infiltrative glioblastoma xenografts with bevacizumab ( anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] antibody , n = 13 ) , cabozantinib ( combined VEGF receptor 2/c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor , n = 11 ) , or placebo ( n = 15 ) and compared CE-MRI with MRS-derived metabolic maps before , during , and after treatment . Metabolic maps and CE-MRIs were subsequently correlated to histology and immunohistochemistry . RESULTS In vivo imaging of choline/n-acetyl aspartate ratios via multivoxel MRS is better able to evaluate response to therapy than CE-MRI . Lactate imaging revealed that diffuse infiltrative areas in glioblastoma xenografts did not present with excessive glycolysis . In contrast , glycolysis was observed in hypoxic areas in angiogenesis-dependent compact regions of glioma only , especially after anti-angiogenic treatment . CONCLUSION Our data present MRSI as a powerful and feasible approach that is superior to CE-MRI and may provide handles for optimizing treatment of glioma . Furthermore , we show that glycolysis is more prominent in hypoxic areas than in areas of diffuse infiltrative growth . The Warburg hypothesis of persisting glycolysis in tumors under normoxic conditions may thus not be valid for diffuse glioma .
