A rat colonic adenocarcinoma was implanted subcutaneously ( s.c. ) in nude mice . After 7 days , the animals were divided into different groups . Two groups received subcutaneous injections twice daily with 3 or 6 micro g/kg body weight octreotide , galanin and serotonin . Three groups were respectively treated with 20 , 30 , and 40 micro g/kg body weight of the previously mentioned bioactive substances . Control group received only saline solution in the same fashion as treated animals . The treatment lasted for 5 days . The tumour volume and weight , the relative density of blood vessels , of tumour necrotic tissue , of apoptotic nuclei and of proliferating nuclei were measured . Apoptosis was detected by in situ labelling of nuclear DNA fragmentation according to TUNEL method , and proliferation by immunocytochemistry . Morphometry was done with the classical stereological point-counting method . Food consumption , animal weight , faeces weight and its water content were measured for 3 days before and after treatment . Triple therapy with 3 and 6 micro g/kg body weight had no effect on any of the parameters measured , except in reducing the relative volume density of tumour blood vessels . Treatment with 20 , 30 and 40 micro g/kg body weight of the previously mentioned bioactive substances reduced the tumour volume , the relative volume density of blood vessels and increased the relative volume density of necrotic tissue and of apoptotic nuclei ( in the 20 micro g group ) . However , there was no difference between treated mice and controls regarding the relative volume density of proliferating nuclei . There was no statistical difference between treated animals regarding food consumption , body weight , faeces weight and its water content before and during treatment . The present study confirms that triple therapy with octreotide , galanin and serotonin causes regression of a rat colon carcinoma . It further showed that optimum treatment dose is 20 micro g/kg body weight of each bioactive substance . Moreover , this therapy regime does not show apparent side effects in the experiments carried out on mice .
OBJECTIVE Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) secondary to EGFR gene amplification is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and a worse clinical outcome . The purpose of this study was to analyze whether blocking this receptor with the anti-EGFR chimeric monoclonal antibody C225 would decrease proliferation and increase apoptosis in GBM cells . METHODS EGFR expression and amplification were analyzed for seven human GBM cell lines . These lines were then exposed to different concentrations of C225 for 48 hours , 72 hours , and 7 days , after which time cytotoxicity , apoptosis , and vascular endothelial growth factor expression were assessed in vitro . Two EGFR-amplified human GBM were implanted in the flanks of nude mice , and the animals received C225 twice per week intraperitoneally for 5 weeks . Tumor volumes and survival times were compared with those of sham-treated mice . RESULTS EGFR gene amplification was demonstrated in three of the primary GBM lines . C225 treatment produced significant cytotoxicity in all three EGFR-amplified GBM lines , but not in unamplified lines . Flow cytometry demonstrated increased apoptosis in C225-treated , EGFR-amplified GBM lines , but not in unamplified lines . There was a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor expression in all GBM lines with exposure to C225 . Tumor-bearing mice treated with C225 experienced significant inhibition of tumor growth as well as a 200% increase in median survival . CONCLUSION Blocking EGFR in GBM cells that overexpress this receptor significantly changes tumor cell biology by promoting apoptosis while decreasing proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor expression . This approach holds great promise for the treatment of patients with GBMs .
OBJECTIVES Epiphyseal cartilage is a barrier to osteosarcoma invasion , however the mechanisms behind this resistance remain unclear . The aim of this study was to examine the chronological and spatial patterns of osteosarcoma growth and invasion of local tissue structures including epiphyseal cartilage . METHODS We used an in vivomouse model of osteosarcoma to histologically examine tumors at different stages of disease progression . We compared the pattern of osteosarcoma penetration of epiphyseal cartilage with the expression pattern of two potent mediators of angiogenesis ; proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and antiangiogenic pigment epithelium-derived factor ( PEDF ) . RESULTS Epiphyseal cartilage remained intact across its entire length in all sections examined , despite increasing tumor size as well as intra- and extraosseous destruction . In the most advanced cases , only the proangiogenic lowermost layers of the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate were eroded . This corresponded with the growth plate layers which highly expressed the angiogenic factor VEGF . In contrast , the resting , proliferative and upper hypertrophic layers were resistant to osteosarcoma invasion in all cases . This corresponded to the layers with the highest expression of the potent antiangiogenic factor PEDF . CONCLUSION Epiphyseal cartilage is resistant to local invasion by osteosarcoma . The balance of angiogenesis , influenced by pro- and antiangiogenic factors , is likely to play an important role in this resistance .
BACKGROUND Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality among US men . Epidemiological evidence suggests that high vitamin D status protects men from prostate cancer and the active form of vitamin D , 1alpha,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1,25(OH)2D ) has anti-cancer effects in cultured prostate cells . Still , the molecular mechanisms and the gene targets for vitamin D-mediated prostate cancer prevention are unknown . RESULTS We examined the effect of 1,25(OH)2D ( +/- 100 nM , 6 , 24 , 48 h ) on the transcript profile of proliferating RWPE1 cells , an immortalized , non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cell line that is growth arrested by 1,25(OH)2D ( Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 , n = 4/treatment per time and dose ) . Our analysis revealed many transcript level changes at a 5% false detection rate : 6 h , 1571 ( 61% up ) , 24 h , 1816 ( 60% up ) , 48 h , 3566 ( 38% up). 288 transcripts were regulated similarly at all time points ( 182 up , 80 down ) and many of the promoters for these transcripts contained putative vitamin D response elements . Functional analysis by pathway or Gene Set Analysis revealed early suppression of WNT , Notch , NF-kB , and IGF1 signaling . Transcripts related to inflammation were suppressed at 6 h ( e.g . IL-1 pathway ) and suppression of proinflammatory pathways continued at later time points ( e.g . IL-17 and IL-6 pathways ) . There was also evidence for induction of anti-angiogenic pathways and induction of transcripts for protection from oxidative stress or maintenance of cell redox homeostasis at 6 h . CONCLUSIONS Our data reveal of large number of potential new , direct vitamin D target genes relevant to prostate cancer prevention . In addition , our data suggests that rather than having a single strong regulatory effect , vitamin D orchestrates a pattern of changes within prostate epithelial cells that limit or slow carcinogenesis .
Bisphosphonates ( BPs ) are the current standard of care for bone lesions in patients with multiple myeloma ( MM ) but they are associated with a number of side effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw . The exact mechanisms of osteonecrosis are not elucidated , and its physiopathology is based on several hypotheses such as a decrease in bone remodeling or an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis . The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis . We examined the apoptosis of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in MM subjects before and after BP treatment and in osteonecrosis patients using a flow-cytometric analysis . Our data showed an increase in endothelial cell apoptosis in MM patients after BP administration and in osteonecrosis subjects . Our study seems in agreement with the hypothesis that BPs can inhibit angiogenesis interfering with endothelial cell proliferation and survival , leading to loss of blood vessels and avascular necrosis .
Hypoxia-reoxygenation ( HR ) is a primary driver of angiogenesis in both atherogenesis and tumorigenesis . The main target of hypoxia-driven proangiogenic signaling is adherens junctions responsible for contact inhibition of endothelial cells . We analyzed the effects of hypoxia ( 8-12 hours ) followed by a brief period of reoxygenation ( 2 hours ) ( HR ) on angiogenesis and integrity of adherens junction in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells as well as the effects of aspirin on modulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ' response to HR . Cells exposed to HR displayed considerable enhancement of tube formation ( angiogenesis ) on matrigel . Immunocytostaining of near-confluent cells revealed that HR caused disruption of adherens junctions and internalization of their components VE-cadherin , p120 catenin , and b-catenin . Additionally , HR resulted in the appearance of binucleated cells , and VE-cadherin in colocalization with b-catenin was found to be positioned between the separating nuclei . Presence of aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid , 1 mM ) resulted in preservation of adherens junctions on the cellular membrane and prevented angiogenesis as well as mitosis . HR caused upregulation LOX-1 , the p47(phox) subunit of NADPH , while reducing transcription of endothelial nitric oxide synthase . Aspirin had no effect on endothelial nitric oxide synthase and canceled the transcriptional activation of the LOX-1 and p47(phox) subunit of NADPH oxidase . Based on these data , we hypothesize that aspirin preserves the integrity of adherens junctions and thus blunts angiogenic response to HR through downregulation of LOX-1 and the LOX-1-mediated p47(phox) component of NADPH oxidase transcription , thus preventing NADPH oxidase assembly and function .
Bladder cancer is one of the most common tumors of the genitourinary tract ; however , the molecular events underlying growth and invasion of the tumor remain unclear . Here , role of the CXCR7 receptor in bladder cancer was further explored . CXCR7 protein expression was examined using high-density tissue microarrays . Expression of CXCR7 showed strong epithelial staining that correlated with bladder cancer progression . In vitro and in vivo studies in bladder cancer cell lines suggested that alterations in CXCR7 expression were associated with the activities of proliferation , apoptosis , migration , invasion , angiogenesis and tumor growth . Moreover , CXCR7 expression was able to regulate expression of the proangiogenic factors IL-8 or VEGF , which may involve in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis . Finally , we found that signaling by the CXCR7 in bladder cancer cells activates AKT , ERK and STAT3 pathways . The AKT and ERK pathways may reciprocally regulate , which are responsible for in vitro and in vivo epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) process of bladder cancer . Simultaneously targeting the two pathways by using U0126 and LY294002 inhibitors or using CCX733 , a selective CXCR7 antagonist drastically reduced CXCR7-induced EMT process . Taken together , our data show for the first time that CXCR7 plays a role in the development of bladder cancer . Targeting CXCR7 or its downstream-activated AKT and ERK pathways may prove beneficial to prevent metastasis and provide a more effective therapeutic strategy for bladder cancer .
We show that sufficient concentrations of gold nanoparticles produced by an original synthesis method in EMT-6 and CT-26 cancer cells make it possible to detect the presence , necrosis and proliferation of such cells after inoculation in live mice . We first demonstrated that the nanoparticles do not interfere with the proliferation process . Then , we observed significant differences in the tumor evolution and the angiogenesis process after shallow and deep inoculation . A direct comparison with pathology optical images illustrates the effectiveness of this approach .
This study is to investigate the effects of bortezomib on the angiogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) . We examined the effects of bortezomib on the cellular proliferation , migration , and capillary network formation of HUVECs cocultured with CMs of MSCs . We found that Bortezomib inhibited the cellular proliferation and tube formation of HUVECs cocultured with CMs in a dose-dependent fashion . Bortezomib also prevented the migration of HUVECs cocultured with CMs . In addition , bortezomib dose-dependently inhibited the growth of MSCs and prevented the production of angiogenic factors including VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) , HGF ( hepatocyte growth factor ) , and bFGF ( basic fibroblast growth factor ) in MSCs . In conclusion , bortezomib prevented the angiogenesis mediated by MSCs .
Tumor cells trigger angiogenesis through overexpression of various angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and angiopoietin 1 ( Ang1 ) . Therefore , inhibition of the expression of both VEGF and Ang1 , the initial step of tumor angiogenesis , is a promising strategy for cancer chemoprevention and therapy . Grape seed proanthocyanidins ( GSPs ) are widely consumed dietary supplements that have antitumor activity . Due to their polymeric structure , GSPs are poorly absorbed along the gastrointestinal tract and can reach the colon at high concentrations , allowing these chemicals to act as chemopreventive agents for colon cancer . In the present study , we found that GSPs inhibited colon tumor-induced angiogenesis and , thus , the growth of colon tumor xenografts on the chick chorioallantoic membranes . The mechanisms of their action were related to inhibiting the expression of both VEGF and Ang1 through scavenging reactive oxygen species . Previous studies have demonstrated that the chemopreventive effects of GSPs on colon cancer are associated with their growth inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects . Our results demonstrate another mechanism by which GSPs inhibit colon tumor growth , which will be helpful for developing GSPs as a pharmacologically safe angiopreventive agent against colorectal cancer .
New molecularly targeted therapies are needed for childhood ependymoma . Angiogenesis and the PDGFR pathway could be potential therapeutic targets . This study aimed to screen ependymomas for the expression and clinicopathological correlates of angiogenic factors and potential therapeutic targets including VEGFR , endoglin ( CD105 ) , CD34 , CD31 , c-Kit , PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta . Immunohistochemistry for angiogenesis factors and PDGFR-alpha and beta was performed in 24 archival tumor samples from children and adults treated for ependymoma at our institution . CD31 density , CD105 density and pericyte coverage index ( PCI ) were calculated . These findings were correlated with clinical outcome . VEGFR2 was overexpressed in tumor cells in only one out of 24 cases , but was found overexpressed in the vessels in 6 cases . PDGFR-alpha and beta were found to be over-expressed in the ependymoma tumor cells in seven out of 24 cases ( 29.2 % ) . CD31 density , CD105 density and PCI did not correlate with expression of PDGFRs . Overexpression of PDGFR-alpha and beta in tumor cells and overexpression of PDGFR-alpha in tumor endothelium had prognostic significance and this was maintained in multivariate analysis for overexpression of PDGFR-alpha in tumor cells ( 2 year progression free survival was 16.7 +/- 15.2 for cases with overexpression of PDGFR-alpha in the tumor vs. 74.5 +/- 15.2 for those with low/no expression , hazard ratio = 5.78 , p = 0.04 ) . A number of angiogenic factors are expressed in ependymoma tumor cells and tumor endothelium . Preliminary evidence suggests that the expression of PDGFRs could have a prognostic significance in ependymoma . This data suggests that PDGFRs should be further evaluated as targets using novel PDGFR inhibitors .
It is well established that angiogenesis is the process of formation of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels . It is a complex process , involving both pro- and anti-angiogenic factors , and plays a significant role in physiological and pathophysiological processes such as embryonic development , atherosclerosis , post-ischemic vascularization of the myocardium , tumor growth and metastasis , rheumatoid arthritis etc . This is the first report of zinc oxide ( ZnO ) nanoflowers that show significant pro-angiogenic properties ( formation of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels ) , observed by in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis assays . The egg yolk angiogenesis assay using ZnO nanoflowers indicates the presence of matured blood vessels formation . Additionally , it helps to promote endothelial cell ( EA.hy926 cells ) migration in wound healing assays . Formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , especially hydrogen peroxide ( H(2)O(2))-a redox signaling molecule , might be the plausible mechanism for nanoflower-based angiogenesis . Angiogenesis by nanoflowers may provide the basis for the future development of new alternative therapeutic treatment strategies for cardiovascular and ischemic diseases , where angiogenesis plays a significant role .
SCOPE Glyceollins are a novel class of soybean phytoalexins with potential cancer-preventive and antiestrogenic effects . The angiogenic cascade during tumor development consists of the release of angiogenic factors and binding of angiogenic factors to receptors on endothelial cells to activate downstream signaling pathways . However , the potential medicinal value of glyceollins , especially in antiangiogenesis , remains unexplored . METHODS AND RESULTS Here , we investigated the antiangiogenic activity of glyceollins and their underlying mechanisms . Glyceollins inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) or basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) induced in vitro angiogenic activity . Glyceollins inhibited VEGF receptor-2 or FGF receptor-1 activity and their downstream signaling pathways such as extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 , c-Jun N-terminal kinase , as well as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and focal adhesion kinase induced by VEGF or bFGF . Glyceollins significantly suppressed VEGF receptor-2 kinase activity assayed by the ELISA . Glyceollins significantly attenuated in vivo and ex vivo microvessel development in a dose-dependent manner and tumor growth by suppressing microvessel density in Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) mouse xenograft . CONCLUSION Thus , glyceollins , elicited ingredients of soy source , target the signaling pathways mediated by VEGF or bFGF , providing new perspectives into potential therapeutics for preventing and treating hypervascularized diseases including cancer .
