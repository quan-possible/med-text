To search for potential biomarkers used to monitor the process of immortalization , we investigated the relative level of telomerase activity and other immortal phenotypes in the SHEE esophageal epithelial cell line . This human fetal esophageal epithelial cell line , induced by human papilloma virus ( HPV ) 18 E6E7 , was continually propagated over 100 passages . Fourteenth passage cells ( SHEE14 ) were cultured in a flask with a serum-free medium and continually cultured to the 30th passage ( SHEE30 ) . Cells of SHEE14 , SHEE20 and SHEE30 were examined according to cell morphology , cell cycle , apoptosis , contact-inhibition growth , anchorage- dependency , dose-dependency to epithelial growth factors ( EGF ) , telomerase activity and tumorigenicity . The SHEE14 cells exhibited good differentiation with contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth . The SHEE20 cells exhibited increase of senescent and apoptotic cells , and difficulty in propagation . The SHEE30 cells exhibited a higher proliferative index and some undifferentiated cells , with weakened contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth . The telomerase was activated in cells of SHEE30 , but not in SHEE14 and SHEE20 cells . The different response to dose-dependency to EGF was not statistically different in SHEE14 and SHEE30 . Three groups of cells displayed lack of tumor formation in nude mice . Compared with SHEE14 and SHEE20 , SHEE30 cells were of immortalized status with immortal phenotype , which consisted of telomerase activity , increase of cell proliferation , weakened contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth , dose dependency to EGF and lack of tumor formation . From passage 14 to 30th passage , SHEE cells went through cellular senescence , apoptosis and immortalization . With a view toward diagnostic and biological aspects , telomerase activity is a crucial step and a cardinal requirement for immortalization . The telomerase activity and other immortal phenotypes are potential markers for monitoring the process of immortalization .
In an attempt to find a strategy to modulate the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells , we examined whether constitutive activation of proto-oncogen protein p21 ( Ras ) induced the reentry of confluent human umbilical vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) into the S phase . When an adenovirus construct expressing a constitutively active Ras mutant ( Ad/RasG12V ) was infected into HUVECs , their morphology changed strikingly and they appeared to be transformed . However , Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs did not enter the S phase , as determined by assessing 3H-thymidine incorporation . In accordance with the above results , the expression of cyclin A both at the transcript and protein levels did not increase in Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs relative to that in control cells , although the expression of cyclin D1 was induced in Ad/RasG12V-infected cells . Interestingly , the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor p21cip1 was remarkably increased while that of p27kip1 did not decrease in Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs . Furthermore , CDK2 activity was not induced in Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs . These results suggested that the constitutive activation of Ras promoted the reentry of confluent HUVECs in the G0 phase into the G1 phase , but not into the S phase . The results also indicated that the constitutive activation of Ras might have induced the persistent expression of p21cip1 and p27kip1 , and that this induction of p21cip1 and p27kip1 expression possibly caused the cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase .
The purpose of this study was to use the proteomics approach , which is based on high resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with multivariate correspondence analysis and mass spectrometry , to classify objectively the biochemical basis of the anti-cancer activity of the synthetic cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , bohemine ( BOH ) . The changes in the cell cycle and corresponding protein composition of the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line after treatment with BOH were evaluated and proteins differentially expressed in the BOH treated A549 cells , compared to the untreated A549 counterparts , were selected . Thirteen of these candidate proteins associated with the drug effects in vitro were identified by mass spectrometry . Many of these proteins fall into one of three functional categories : i ) metabolic pathways ( glycolysis , nucleic acid synthesis and NADPH production ) , ii ) stress response and protein folding , and iii ) cytoskeleton and exocytosis . Changes in protein expression patterns corresponded to a higher resistance of A549 lung carcinoma cells to BOH when compared to the CEM leukaemia cell line . These protein changes reflect a fine balance of the resistant versus the susceptible phenotype in response to the drug . Since BOH is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , changes in the protein expression pattern can be more generally associated with cell cycle regulation as evidenced by inhibition of cell cycling in A549 cells . Our conclusions further underline the importance of cell cycle control in both the cellular signalling and metabolic pathways .
Solar ultraviolet radiation is considered to be injurious rather than necessary for most organisms living on the earth . It is reported that the risk of skin cancer in humans increases by the depletion of the ozone layer . We have examined the genotoxicity of solar ultraviolet , especially the longer wavelength light , using Drosophila . Recently , we have demonstrated that light of wavelength up to 340 nm is mutagenic on Drosophila larvae . Using an excision repair-deficient Drosophila strain ( mus201 ) , we have obtained results suggesting that the lesion caused in larvae by the 320 nm-light irradiation may be similar to the damage induced by irradiation at 310 nm , and that light of 330 and 340 nm may induce damage different from that induced by 310 and 320 nm-light . To examine the difference in DNA damage induced by light of a particular wavelength , we performed monochromatic irradiation on larvae of two Drosophila strains ; one excision repair-deficient ( mei-9 ) and another postreplication repair-deficient ( mei-41). 310 and 320 nm-light was more mutagenic in the mei-9 strain than in mei-41 , whereas 330 and 340 nm-light was more mutagenic in mei-41 than in mei-9 . It is demonstrated that the mei-41 gene is a homologue of the human atm gene which is responsible for a cell cycle checkpoint . This result suggests that 310-320 nm-light induces DNA damage that is subject to nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and that 330-360 nm-light causes damage to be recognized by the cell cycle checkpoint but it is not repairable by NER .
BACKGROUND & AIMS Hepatocytes are considered an exception of the paradigmatic inverse correlation between cell proliferation and terminal differentiation . In fact , hepatic vital functions are guaranteed by proliferating parenchymal cells during liver regeneration . However , a fine molecular characterization of the relationship between proliferation and differentiation in hepatocytes has been hampered by the lack of reliable in vivo or in vitro models . METHODS The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program was characterized in the immortalized , untransformed and differentiated hepatocytic cell line MMH , using several techniques . Particularly , two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis combined to tandem mass spectrometry proteomic approach was used . Cell cycle and cell adhesion properties of MMH have been altered using either myc-overexpression and MEK1/2 inhibition or a constitutive active beta-catenin mutant , respectively . RESULTS The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program is stimulated by the exit from the cell cycle induced by cell-cell contact . Comparative proteomic analysis of proliferating versus quiescent hepatocytes validated the importance of contact inhibition , identifying 68 differently expressed gene products , representing 49 unique proteins . Notably , enzymes involved in important liver functions such as detoxification processes , lipid metabolism , iron and vitamin A storage and secretion , anti-inflammatory response and exocytosis were found significantly up-regulated in quiescent hepatocytes . Finally , we found that : ( i ) cell cycle arrest induced by MEK1/2 inhibition is not sufficient to induce hepatic product expression ; ( ii ) constitutive activation of beta-catenin counteracts the contact inhibition-induced terminal differentiation . CONCLUSION The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program requires a quiescent state maintained by cell-cell contact through the E-cadherin/beta-catenin pathway , rather than the inhibition of proliferation .
BACKGROUND Inorganic arsenic is a ubiquitous environmental carcinogen affecting millions of people worldwide . Evolving theory predicts that normal stem cells ( NSCs ) are transformed into cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) that then drive oncogenesis . In humans , arsenic is carcinogenic in the urogenital system ( UGS ) , including the bladder and potentially the prostate , whereas in mice arsenic induces multi-organ UGS cancers , indicating that UGS NSCs may represent targets for carcino-genic initiation . However , proof of emergence of CSCs induced by arsenic in a stem cell population is not available . METHODS We continuously exposed the human prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cell line WPE-stem to an environmentally relevant level of arsenic ( 5 microM ) in vitro and determined the acquired cancer phenotype . RESULTS WPE-stem cells rapidly acquired a malignant CSC-like phenotype by 18 weeks of exposure , becoming highly invasive , losing contact inhibition , and hyper-secreting matrix metalloproteinase-9 . When hetero-transplanted , these cells ( designated As-CSC ) formed highly pleomorphic , aggressive tumors with immature epithelial- and mesenchymal-like cells , suggesting a highly pluripotent cell of origin . Consistent with tumor-derived CSCs , As-CSCs formed abundant free-floating spheres enriched in CSC-like cells , as confirmed by molecular analysis and the fact that only these floating cells formed xeno-graft tumors . An early loss of NSC self-renewal gene expression ( p63 , ABCG2 , BMI-1 , SHH , OCT-4 , NOTCH-1 ) during arsenite exposure was sub-sequently reversed as the tumor suppressor gene PTEN was progressively suppressed and the CSC-like phenotype acquired . CONCLUSIONS Arsenite transforms prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cells into CSC-like cells , indicating that it can produce CSCs from a model NSC population .
The neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) tumor suppressor gene encodes merlin , a membrane/cytoskeleton protein necessary for the maintenance of contact inhibition of growth in cells . Bi-allelic inactivation of NF2 is known to cause multiple cancers in both humans and mice . However , the mechanism through which merlin exerts its tumor-suppressive function remains obscure . In this report , we show that NF2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts lost contact inhibition of cell proliferation and contained significantly increased canonical Wnt signaling . Inhibition of Rac1 , the activity of which is inversely regulated by NF2 , through the use of a dominant-negative mutant , small hairpin RNA or a small molecule inhibitor in NF2-deficient cells , was able to suppress elevated Wnt signals as shown by reduced activity of the T-cell factor 4 ( TCF4 ) transcription factor . Dominant-negative TCF4 or Rac1 mutant , as well as a small molecule inhibition of Wnt , were able to curb NF2 deficiency-elicited cell proliferation at the confluent state . Thus , Rac1-mediated canonical Wnt signaling is essential for the loss of contact inhibition in NF2-deficient cells .
BACKGROUND The incidence of ovarian cancer has been increasing worldwide and it is currently the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancy . Unlike breast cancer , the prognostic role of the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( HER-2 ) in ovarian carcinoma remains controversial . METHODS The aim of this preclinical study was to further characterise the biological , molecular and cellular effects of trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) using NIH-OVCAR-3 and derived cell lines both in vitro and in vivo . RESULTS In vitro assessments have shown that trastuzumab treatment inhibited total and phosphorylated HER-2 . This was associated with inhibition of the phosphorylated form of phosphatase and tensin homologue ( PTEN ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT , and the total level of p27(kip) . Inhibition of PTEN is associated with phosphorylated MEK1/2 upregulation , suggesting a specific inhibition of the protein phosphatase function of PTEN . Moreover , trastuzumab induced the upregulation of RhoB . These molecular modifications promote inhibition of cell migration and potentially restoration of tumour cell contact inhibition . RhoB induction in NIH-OVCAR-3 control cell lines mimics the molecular and cellular trastuzumab long-time exposition effects . RhoB inhibition in NIH-OVCAR-3 long-time exposed to trastuzumab cell line reverses the cellular and molecular effects observed in this model . In vivo examinations have shown that these changes are also associated with the restoration of structural , morphological and normal functions of the peritoneum of an ovarian carcinoma mouse model . CONCLUSION These results provide an indication of the mechanisms underlying the anti-tumour activity of trastuzumab that strongly implicate RhoB in an ovarian carcinoma model that does not show HER-2 amplification or overexpression . These findings highlight that trastuzumab effects involve a possible cross-talk between RhoB and PTEN in the early stages of tumour re-growth in a model of micrometastatic ovarian cancer .
This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which the human lung cancer drug resistance-related gene BC006151 regulates chemosensitivity by down-regulating BC006151 expression via antisense gene transfer in H446/(C)DDP cells . A retroviral vector containing the antisense BC006151 sequence was constructed and transfected into H446/(C)DDP cells . Transfection of the empty vector served as a negative control . The two groups of transfected cells were treated with various chemotherapeutic agents , after which morphological changes in cell ultrastructure were compared by transmission electron microscopy , cell proliferation and chemosensitivity to particular chemotherapeutic agents were compared by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method , the effects of chemotherapy on cell cycle and apoptosis were compared by flow cytometry , and Bcl-2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis . Results showed that apoptotic body-like structures were identified by transmission electron microscopy in the antisense gene-transfected cells . MTT founded that these cells exhibited a significantly lower level of proliferation than the control cells ( p<0.01 ) , together with a markedly increased sensitivity to various chemotherapeutic agents ( p<0.01 ) . Flow cytometry analysis revealed that a G1 phase arrest accounted for the reduction in proliferation in the antisense gene-transfected cells ; increased apoptosis was also detected ( p<0.01 ) . Both immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis confirmed that Bcl-2 expression was significantly down-regulated in the antisense gene-transfected cells compared to controls . In a word , down-regulation of BC006151 can significantly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis of H446/(C)DDP cells after chemotherapy , and this gene may play an important role in the development of multidrug resistance in lung cancer .
INTRODUCTION Natural herbal compounds with novel actions different from existing breast cancer ( BCa ) treatment modalities are attractive for improving therapeutic efficacy and safety . We have recently shown that penta-1,2,3,4,6-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose ( PGG ) induced S-phase arrest in prostate cancer ( PCa ) cells through inhibiting DNA replicative synthesis and G(1) arrest , in addition to inducing cell death at higher levels of exposure . We and others have shown that PGG through intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection exerts a strong in vivo growth suppression of human PCa xenograft models in athymic nude mice . This study aims to test the hypothesis that the novel targeting actions of PGG are applicable to BCa cells , especially those lacking proven druggable targets . METHODS Mono-layer cell culture models of p53-wild type estrogen receptor ( ER)-dependent MCF-7 BCa cells and p53-mutant ER-/progesterone receptor ( PR)- and Her2-regular ( triple-negative ) MDA-MB-231 BCa were exposed to PGG for a comprehensive investigation of cellular consequences and molecular targets/mediators . To test the in vivo efficacy , female athymic mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231 xenograft were treated with 20mg PGG/kg body weight by daily gavage starting 4 days after cancer cell inoculation . RESULTS Exposure to PGG induced S-phase arrest in both cell lines as indicated by the lack of 5-bromo2'-deoxy-uridine ( BrdU ) incorporation into S-phase cells as well as G(1) arrest . Higher levels of PGG induced more caspase-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 , in strong association with induction of P53 Ser(15) phosphorylation , than in MDA-MB-231 cells . The cell cycle arrests were achieved without an induction of cyclin dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitory proteins P21(Cip1) and P27(Kip1) . PGG treatment led to decreased cyclin D1 in both cell lines and over-expressing cyclin D1 attenuated G(1) arrest and hastened S arrest . In serum-starvation synchronized MCF-7 cells , down-regulation of cyclin D1 was associated with de-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma ( Rb ) protein by PGG shortly before G(1)-S transition . In vivo , oral administration of PGG led to a greater than 60% inhibition of MDA-MB231 xenograft growth without adverse effect on host body weight . CONCLUSIONS Our in vitro and in vivo data support PGG as a potential drug candidate for breast cancer with novel targeting actions , especially for a triple negative BCa xenograft model .
Ceramide induces cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death associated with increased levels of p27(kip1) . The aim of this study was to examine the effects of ceramide on p27(kip1) protein levels as a measure of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis . Results showed that ceramide increased p27(kip1) protein levels through activation of protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) in PC-3 prostate cancer cells . Treatment of cells with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid or with PP2A-Calpha siRNA inhibited ceramide-induced enhanced p27(kip1) protein expression and Akt dephosphorylation , and prevented Skp2 downregulation . Overexpression of constitutively active Akt attenuated ceramide-induced Skp2 downregulation and p27(kip1) upregulation . In addition , ceramide stimulated binding of the PP2A catalytic subunit PP2A-Calphabeta to Akt as assessed by immunoprecipitation experiments , indicating that PP2A is involved in the induction of p27(kip1) via inhibition of Akt pathway . Finally , whether PP2A can regulate p27(kip1) expression independently of Akt pathway was determined . Knockdown of PP2A-Calpha with siRNA reduced p27(kip1) levels in the presence of Akt inhibitor . These data reveal that PP2A is a regulator of ceramide-induced p27(kip1) expression via Akt-dependent and Akt-independent pathways .
Currently there is no good hepatocyte model for studying growth hormone ( GH ) function that reflects its normal physiological roles . Here we report the establishment of a functional hepatocyte cell line , SDRL-1 , from the liver of young male spontaneous dwarf rats ( SDR ) , with isolated GH deficiency . This line has been maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM)/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) with retention of a near diploid karyotype for extended periods of time . When grown as a monolayer sheet , it displayed a pavement-like appearance and contact inhibition . These cells have a poorly developed rough endoplasmic reticulum ( r-ER ) , few mitochondria and glycogen granules , and produce a small amount of albumin and alpha-fetoprotein , that is enhanced when grown on a collagen gel sponge . Human recombinant GH stimulated JAK2 and STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation and IGF-I production in a concentration-dependent manner . When the cells were cultured with GH-supplemented medium , the number of mitochondria and glycogen granules increased together with the r-ER and Golgi apparatus . A number of microvilli were observed on the surface of the cultured cells , further suggesting that this cell line is composed of normally functioning hepatocytes . In summary , we established a novel hepatocyte cell line ( SDRL-1 ) , that appears to display normal function , which we propose can serve as a good in vitro model for studying GH-target organ interactions .
BACKGROUND Special AT-rich binding protein-1 ( SATB1 ) reprograms chromatin organization and transcription profiles to promote tumour growth and metastasis . AIMS This study aimed to confirm the effects of SATB1 on the growth and metastasis of liver cancer and its specific regulation mechanism . METHODS SATB1 expression was evaluated in human hepatoma tissue , adjacent noncancerous tissue and seven kinds of liver cancer cell lines . Cell cycle , cell proliferation , apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) was investigated after enhanced or silenced expression of SATB1 . The regulatory action of SATB1 on the expression of genes that are known to regulate cell cycle progression , apoptosis and EMT and the specific apoptotic pathway on which it acts were further analysed . Nude mice that received subcutaneous implantation were used to study the effects of SATB1 on tumour growth in vivo . RESULTS Our data show that the high expression of SATB1 was observed in the human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue ( 26/45 ) and liver cancer cell lines with high metastatic potential . SATB1 upregulated CDK4 and downregulated p16 ( INK ) ( 4A ) to promote cell cycle progression and cell proliferation and prevented apoptosis by inhibiting the FADD-caspase-8-caspase-3 death receptor-mediated apoptosis pathway . SATB1 also induced EMT concomitant with increased expression of Snail1 , Slug , Twist and vimentin and decreased expression of E-cadherin , tight junction protein ZO-1 and desmoplakin . SATB1 promoted the growth of tumour in vivo . CONCLUSION These data suggest that the SATB1 gene may play an important role in the development and progression of liver cancer by regulation of genes related to cell cycle progression , apoptosis and EMT .
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) contributes to the control of cell-to-cell communication , cell adhesion , migration or proliferation . In the present study , we investigated the regulation of connexin43 ( Cx43 ) and Cx43-mediated gap junctional intercellular communication ( GJIC ) during the AhR-dependent disruption of contact inhibition in non-tumorigenic liver epithelial cells . The contact inhibition of cell proliferation is a process restricting the cell division of confluent non-transformed cells , which is frequently abolished in cancer cells ; however , the mechanisms contributing to its disruption are still only partially understood . Disruption of contact inhibition , which was induced by toxic AhR ligands 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in epithelial WB-F344 cells , reduced Cx43 protein levels , possibly via enhanced proteasomal degradation , significantly decreased the amount of gap junction plaques and downregulated GJIC , in an AhR-dependent manner . Although both intracellular and membrane Cx43 pools were markedly reduced in cells released from contact inhibition by TCDD , siRNA-mediated Cx43 knock-down was not sufficient to stimulate proliferation in contact-inhibited cells . Our data suggest that downregulation of Cx43/GJIC in non-transformed epithelial cells is an inherent part of disruption of contact inhibition , which occurs at the post-transcriptional level . This process runs in parallel with alterations of other forms of cell-to-cell communication , thus suggesting that toxic AhR agonists may simultaneously abrogate contact inhibition and reduce GJIC , two essential mechanisms linked to deregulation of cell-to-cell communication during tumor promotion and progression .
Trabecular meshwork ( TM ) cells have widely been used as an invitro model for glaucoma research . However , primary TM cells suffer the disadvantages of limited cell numbers and slow rates of proliferation . We discovered a spontaneously transformed bovine TM ( BTM ) cell line , BTM-28T . This cell line proliferated rapidly in low-glucose culture medium but also demonstrated contact inhibition in high-glucose culture medium . BTM-28T cells expressed key TM cell markers including \u03b1-smooth muscle actin ( \u03b1-SMA ) , laminin and collagen IV ( col IV ) . Also , 100nM dexamethasone ( DEX ) enhanced the formation of cross-linked actin networks ( CLANs ) in confluent BTM-28T cell cultures . Transforming growth factor beta 2 ( TGF\u03b22 ) induced the expression of fibronectin ( FN ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) , and connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) in our cell cultures . This cell line will be helpful to better understand the aqueous humor outflow pathway as related to the pathophysiology of glaucoma .
The prediction of response or severe toxicity and therapy individualisation are extremely important in cancer chemotherapy . There are few tools to predict chemoresponse or toxicity in cancer patients . We investigated the correlation between the induction and repair of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) using constant-field gel electrophoresis ( CFGE ) and evaluating cell cycle progression and the sensitivity of four cancer cell lines to 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) . Using a sulphorhodamine-B assay , colon carcinoma cells ( HCT116 ) were found to be the most sensitive to 5FU , followed by liver carcinoma cells ( HepG2 ) and breast carcinoma cells ( MCF-7 ) . Cervical carcinoma cells ( HeLa ) were the most resistant . As measured by CFGE , DSB induction , but not residual DSBs , exhibited a significant correlation with the sensitivity of the cell lines to 5FU . Flow cytometric cell cycle analysis revealed that 14% of HCT116 or HepG2 cells and 2% of MCF-7 cells shifted to sub-G1 phase after a 96-h incubation with 5FU . Another 5FU-induced cell cycle change in HCT116 , HepG2 and MCF-7 cells was the mild arrest of cells in G1 and/or G2/M phases of the cell cycle . In addition , 5FU treatment resulted in the accumulation of HeLa cells in the S and G2/M phases . Determination of Fas ligand ( Fas-L ) and caspase 9 as representative markers for the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis , respectively , revealed that 5FU-induced apoptosis in HCT116 and HepG2 results from the expression of Fas-L ( extrinsic pathway ) . Therefore , the induction of DNA DSBs by 5FU , detected using CFGE , and the induction of apoptosis are candidate predictive markers that may distinguish cancer cells which are likely to benefit from 5FU treatment and the measurement of DSBs using CFGE may aid the prediction of clinical outcome .
A predictive mathematical model of the transition from the G2 phase in the cell cycle to mitosis ( M ) was constructed from the known interactions of the proteins that are thought to play significant roles in the G2 to M transition as well as the DNA damage- induced G2 checkpoint . The model simulates the accumulation of active cyclin B1/Cdk1 ( MPF ) complexes in the nucleus to activate mitosis , the inhibition of this process by DNA damage , and transport of component proteins between cytoplasm and nucleus . Interactions in the model are based on activities of individual phospho-epitopes and binding sites of proteins involved in G2/M . Because tracking phosphoforms leads to combinatorial explosion , we employ a rule-based approach using the BioNetGen software . The model was used to determine the effects of depletion or over-expression of selected proteins involved in the regulation of the G2 to M transition in the presence and absence of DNA damage . Depletion of Plk1 delayed mitotic entry and recovery from the DNA damage-induced G2 arrest and over-expression of MPF attenuated the DNA damage-induced G2 delay . The model recapitulates the G2 delay observed in the biological response to varying levels of a DNA damage signal . The model produced the novel prediction that depletion of pkMyt1 results in an abnormal biological state in which G2 cells with DNA damage accumulate inactive nuclear MPF . Such a detailed model may prove useful for predicting DNA damage G2 checkpoint function in cancer and , therefore , sensitivity to cancer therapy .
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) , a subgroup of ligand-activated nuclear receptors , plays critical roles in cell cycle regulation , differentiation , apoptosis and invasion . PPARgamma is involved in tumorigenesis and is a potent target for cancer therapy . PPARgamma transactivation of KLF4 has been demonstrated in various studies ; however , how PPARgamma regulates KLF4 expression is not clear . In this study , we revealed that PPARgamma regulates the expression of KLF4 by binding directly to the PPAR response element ( PPRE ) within the KLF4 promoter . The PPRE resided at -1657bp to -1669bp upstream of the KLF4 ATG codon , which is essential for the transactivation of TGZ-induced KLF4 expression . Furthermore , we found that stable silencing of KLF4 obviously suppressed the G1/S arrest and anti-proliferation effects induced by PPARgamma ligands . Taken together , our data indicated that upregulating KLF4 upon PPARgamma activation is mediated through PPRE in KLF4 promoter , thus providing further insights into PPARgamma signal transduction pathway as well as a novel cancer therapeutic strategy .
Dichlorvos , an organophosphate ( OP ) , is known to cause oxidative stress in the central nervous system ( CNS ) . Previously we have shown that dichlorvos treatment promoted the levels of proinflammatory molecules and ultimately induced apoptotic cell death in primary microglial cells . Here we studied the effect of dichlorvos on crucial cell cycle regulatory proteins and the DNA damage sensor ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) . We found a significant increase in p53 and its downstream target , p21 , levels in dichlorvos-treated microglial cells compared with control cells . Moreover , dichlorvos exposure promoted the levels of different cell cycle regulatory proteins . These results along with flow cytometry results suggested that primary microglial cells were arrested at G1 and G2/M phase after dichlorvos exposure . We have shown in a previous study that dichlorvos can induce DNA damage in microglia ; here we found that microglial cells also tried to repair this damage by inducing a DNA repair enzyme , i.e. , ATM . We observed a significant increase in the levels of ATM after dichlorvos treatment compared with control .
BACKGROUND Methyl sulfone is a small molecule that reverses cancerous phenotypes of a melanoma cell line . Here , we sought to determine whether methyl sulfone was effective against human breast cancer tissue . METHODS We studied normal and cancerous breast tissue obtained from 17 patients . RESULTS Methyl sulfone introduced structural order , with cancer tissue taking on the morphology of normal in vivo breast tissue ; this structural order was sustainable over long-term culture . Methyl sulfone promoted proper wound healing , including migration of cells into wounded areas and establishment of stable contact inhibition once wounds were covered . Methyl sulfone decreased expression of two breast stem cell marker proteins , HCAM and OCT3/4 , which are associated with aberrantly rapid migration of metastatic cells . Finally , normal and cancerous primary breast cells remained viable and healthy in methyl sulfone culture for at least 90 days . CONCLUSION Methyl sulfone reintroduced a normal structural phenotype to human breast cancer tissues .
During tumorigenesis , cells acquire immortality in association with the development of genomic instability . However , it is still elusive how genomic instability spontaneously generates during the process of tumorigenesis . Here , we show that precancerous DNA lesions induced by oncogene acceleration , which induce situations identical to the initial stages of cancer development , trigger tetraploidy/aneuploidy generation in association with mitotic aberration . Although oncogene acceleration primarily induces DNA replication stress and the resulting lesions in the S phase , these lesions are carried over into the M phase and cause cytokinesis failure and genomic instability . Unlike directly induced DNA double-strand breaks , DNA replication stress-associated lesions are cryptogenic and pass through cell-cycle checkpoints due to limited and ineffective activation of checkpoint factors . Furthermore , since damaged M-phase cells still progress in mitotic steps , these cells result in chromosomal mis-segregation , cytokinesis failure and the resulting tetraploidy generation . Thus , our results reveal a process of genomic instability generation triggered by precancerous DNA replication stress .
The aim of this study was to determine whether isorhamnetin , an immediate 3'-O-methylated metabolite of quercetin , affects proliferation , cell death , and the cell cycle of human colon carcinoma ( HCT-116 ) cells . Isorhamnetin was found to be a potent antiproliferative agent in a dose- and time-dependent manner , with an IC50 of 72 muM after 48 h of incubation as estimated by MTT assay . Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy analysis showed that isorhamnetin exerted a stimulatory effect on apoptosis and necrosis . Isorhamnetin also increased the number of cells in G2/M phase . Serum deprivation appeared to potentiate the effects of isorhamnetin on cell death and facilitated cell cycle progression to G0/G1 phase . These results suggest that isorhamnetin might mediate inhibition of HCT-116 cell growth through the perturbation of cell cycle progression and are consistent with the notion that G2/M checkpoints could be a conserved target for flavonoids in human colon cancer cells , leading to apoptotic and necrotic death . These antiproliferative , apoptotic , necrotic , and cell cycle effects suggest that isorhamnetin may have clinically significant therapeutic and chemopreventive capabilities . To our knowledge , this is the first report of the effect of isorhamnetin on human colon cancer cells .
