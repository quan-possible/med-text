NIH-3T3 cells are non-tumorigenic when injected into athymic mice . If these cells are mixed with an extract of basement-membrane proteins ( matrigel ) and injected s.c. , they form locally invasive and highly vascularized tumors . Cells cultured from the NIH-3T3-matrigel-induced tumors showed a transformed phenotype and lacked contact inhibition . When cultured in a gel of matrigel , they proliferated and formed branched and invasive colonies . In contrast , the parental NIH-3T3 cells cultured on matrigel remained as cell aggregates and were not invasive . I.V. injections of the tumor-derived NIH-3T3 cells produced many colonies on the surface of the lungs , whereas the parental NIH-3T3 cells were not metastatic . Zymographic analysis of the conditioned media obtained from both the tumor-derived and parental NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated higher amounts of the 72-kDa gelatinase ( type-IV collagenase ) enzyme in the tumor-derived cells . Also , tumor-derived NIH-3T3 cells , but not parental NIH-3T3 cells , secreted the 92-kDa type-IV collagenase . These studies suggest that the interaction of pre-malignant NIH-3T3 cells with extracellular matrix components may contribute to the process of tumor progression .
The influence of cell shape on the expression of proto-oncogenes was examined in normal and malignant human cells that varied in their sensitivities to contact-inhibition of proliferation . Cells were constrained into varying degrees of roundness by plating onto culture surfaces coated with different concentrations of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate ) ( poly[HEMA] ) and assayed for proliferation capacity and levels of c-myc , c-ras , c-fos , and c-fes mRNAs . Proliferation of contact-inhibited normal CUA-1 fibroblasts and the variant HT-IFNr cells was highly coupled to cell shape . As these cells became more rounded , a critical degree of roundness was reached at which proliferation ceased . In contrast , proliferation of non-contact-inhibited malignant HT-1080 cells was independent of cell shape . Northern analysis revealed that expression of c-myc and c-ras was highly sensitive to cell shape in the normal CUA-1 cells but not in the malignant HT-1080 or variant HT-IFNr cells . Levels of c-myc and c-ras mRNAs declined to nearly undetectable levels in CUA-1 cells at degrees of roundness that correlated with loss of proliferative ability . Expression of c-fos and c-fes oncogenes were independent of cell shape in all cells tested . Quantification of transcription rates by the nuclear run-off assay showed that shape modulation of c-myc and c-ras oncogene expression occurred at the transcriptional level . These data suggest that changes in cell shape can modulate expression of certain oncogenes and that these changes correlate with the cell's ability to proliferate . Moreover , inability to regulate c-myc and c-ras oncogene expression is associated with loss of shape-dependent growth controls and contact inhibition but that loss of this regulation alone is not sufficient to release cells from contact-inhibited controls .
The effect of quercetin , a flavonoid found in many plants , on the proliferation of human leukemic T-cells was analyzed . Quercetin reversibly blocked the cell cycle at a point 3-6 h before the start of DNA synthesis . Expression of the growth-related genes histone H4 , cyclin A and B , and p34cdc2 was suppressed in cells blocked with quercetin . Comparison of the quercetin arrest points with those of the cell cycle inhibitors aphidicolin and mimosine revealed a temporal order of arrest points in G1 of quercetin , mimosine , and aphidicolin . Mimosine and aphidicolin did not inhibit the expression of cyclin A or p34cdc2 , whereas all three reagents inhibited expression of cyclin B. Low concentrations of the protein inhibitor cycloheximide inhibited release of the quercetin but not the mimosine or aphidicolin block . A [ 35S]methionine-labeled M(r) 60,000 protein disappeared in quercetin-treated cells and was rapidly synthesized after removal of quercetin , suggesting the possibility that the M(r) 60,000 protein induces DNA synthesis after the cell is released from a quercetin block . These results suggest the usefulness of quercetin in studies of the regulation of late G1 phase .
Intracellular pH ( pHi ) plays a critical role in the entry of cells into the DNA-synthesis phase of the cell cycle . Alterations in pHi may contribute to abnormal proliferative responses such as those seen in tumorigenic cells . We observed that alkaline stress leads to genomic transformation of Madin-Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells . Transformed cells ( F cells ) form " foci " in culture , lack contact inhibition , and are able to migrate , typical characteristics of dedifferentiated tumorigenic cells . F cells exhibit spontaneous biorhythmicity . Rhythmic transmembrane Ca2+ flux activates plasma membrane K+ channels and Na+/H+ exchange . This leads to periodic changes of membrane voltage and pHi at about one cycle per minute . We conclude that endogenous oscillatory activity could be a trigger mechanism for DNA synthesis , proliferation , and abnormal growth of renal epithelial cells in culture .
We found that the human colon cancer cell line SW480 consists of two distinct subpopulations which we have designated E-type ( epithelial ) and R-type ( round ) . Pure cultures of each type were obtained by subcloning , and both have maintained their characteristic phenotypes for at least 1 year ( 40 passages ) . E-type cells are the major ( > 98% ) type in the parental SW480 cell line . They form flat epithelial-like colonies . In contrast , R-type cells , which constitute a minor fraction ( < 2% ) of the parental cell line , have a rounded shape and grow in clusters of piled-up cells . Compared to E-type cells or the parental SW480 cells , isolated R-type cells display decreased doubling time , loss of contact inhibition , less adhesiveness to culture plates , higher anchorage-independent growth in soft agar , and a much more aneuploid karyotype . When injected s.c. into nude mice , R-type cells produce much larger tumors within the same period of time than E-type cells , and the tumors are less differentiated than those produced by the E-type cells . Cell fusion experiments between R-type and E-type cells revealed that the R-type phenotype is dominant , and the results suggest that this is due to one or a few genetic changes . Taken together , these findings suggest that the R-type cells represent a more malignant variant of the E-type cells . They may be useful , therefore , for studying mechanisms involved in tumor progression .
Cells dissociated from spontaneous and transplanted tumours of C3HJax mammary gland have been cultured on polylysine and gelatin substrates . The isolated cells proliferated to form monolayers with high degree of organoid structure as indicated by formation of alveolar cavities . Differences were observed in the cell attachment , growth pattern , number and size of alveolar cavities , cells which lined the cavity and cell morphology on polylysine and gelatin substrates as compared to conventional cell culture plastic surface . On polylysine more than 90% cells attached rapidly , within 15-45 min after plating , with or without serum and formed confluent monolayers marked by presence of large and small alveolar cavities . Multiple interacting cell types took part in organization of the cavity . Cells lining the cavity constantly proliferated and rearranged to expand it . On gelatin , 60-70% cells attached over a period of 6-24 hr in presence of serum and formed confluent monolayers dominated by small alveolar cavities . Cells forming the cavities were epithelial in nature and cavities once formed did not increase in size . Upon subculture , the cell morphology on these substrates was strikingly different . On polylysine , the predominant cell type had numerous irregular microvilli whereas on gelatin , cells had smoother boundaries with a few stunted cytoplasmic extensions . The cell attachment on conventional surface was low , 40-50% . When seeded at high cell density , formation of alveolar cavities was suppressed and at low cell density , cultures were marked by contact inhibition of cells and failure to attain confluence . These results suggest differential behaviour and interaction of mammary tumour epithelium with the substrates used .
To assess the importance of changes in DNA methylation in an X-ray-induced cellular transformation process , methylation patterns of five nuclear protooncogenes in fifteen transformant clones were studied and compared to that of the parental non-transformed cell line m5S/1M . All transformants examined revealed an alteration in DNA methylation in some of the genes , although these changes were variable among them . A comparison of cellular characteristics with corresponding DNA methylation changes in different clones suggested that the loss of contact inhibition and the gain of anchorage independency were associated with increases of methylation in many genes , whereas the acquisition of tumorigenicity was often accompanied by a decrease of methylation in the N-myc and c-myc genes . Resultant data indicate that the alteration of DNA methylation is closely related to transformation process , yet how this involvement occurs is complex and remains unclear .
PURPOSE The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 ( Iressa ; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals , Alderley Park , United Kingdom ) is under development as an anticancer agent . We studied the pharmacodynamic effects of ZD1839 on EGFR in the skin , an EGFR-dependent tissue , in cancer patients participating in ZD1839 phase I clinical trials . PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied 104 pre- and/or on-ZD1839 therapy ( approximately at day 28 of therapy ) skin biopsies from 65 patients receiving escalating doses of daily oral ZD1839 . We measured ZD1839 effects on EGFR activation by immunohistochemistry using an antibody specific for the activated ( phosphorylated ) EGFR . Effects on receptor signaling ( activated mitogen-activated protein kinase [ MAPK] ) , proliferation , p27(KIP1) , and maturation were also assessed . RESULTS Histopathologically , the stratum corneum of the epidermis was thinner during therapy ( P <.001 ) . In hair follicles , prominent keratin plugs and microorganisms were found in dilated infundibula . ZD1839 suppressed EGFR phosphorylation in all EGFR-expressing cells ( P <.001 ) . In addition , ZD1839 inhibited MAPK activation ( P <.001 ) and reduced keratinocyte proliferation index ( P <.001 ) . Concomitantly , ZD1839 increased the expression of p27(KIP1) ( P <.001 ) and maturation markers ( P <.001 ) and increased apoptosis ( P <.001 ) . These effects were observed at all dose levels , before reaching dose-limiting toxicities . CONCLUSION ZD1839 inhibits EGFR activation and affects downstream receptor-dependent processes in vivo . These effects were profound at doses well below the one producing unacceptable toxicity , a finding that strongly supports pharmacodynamic assessments to select optimal doses instead of a maximum-tolerated dose for definitive efficacy and safety trials .
We have used a combination of vitamin A ( all-trans-retinyl palmitate ) , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) and radiation to treat human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . This chemoradiotherapy is called " FAR therapy. " In this study we examined the effects of all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , the active metabolite of vitamin A , and ATRA plus 5-FU on two HNSCC cell lines ( YCU-N861 and YCU-H891 ) to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of FAR therapy . ATRA at 1 mM ( the order of concentration found in HNSCC tumors treated with FAR therapy ) inhibited cell proliferation and caused G1 cell cycle arrest in both cell lines . This was associated with a decrease in cyclin D1 , an increase in p27(Kip1) and a reduction in the hyperphosphorylated form of retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) . With YCU-N861 cells , ATRA also caused a decrease in Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) and an increase in Bax . Both ATRA and 5-FU activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) 1 and the combination of both agents resulted in additive or synergistic activation of JNK1 , and also enhanced the induction of apoptosis . The YCU-H891 cells , in which the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( Stat3 ) pathway is constitutively activated , were more resistant to treatments with ATRA , 5-FU and the combination of both agents than YCU-N861 cells . A dominant negative Stat3 construct strongly enhanced the cellular sensitivity of this cell line to 5-FU but not to ATRA . In addition there is evidence that activation of Stat3 is associated with cellular resistance to radiation in HNSCC . Therefore , the addition to FAR therapy of agents that inhibit activation of the Stat3 pathway may enhance the clinical response of patients with HNSCC to FAR therapy .
We investigated the direct effects of LH-releasing hormone ( LH-RH ) antagonist , Cetrorelix , on the growth of HTOA human epithelial ovarian cancer cell line . RT-PCR revealed the expression of mRNA for LH-RH and its receptor in HTOA cells . Cetrorelix , at concentrations between 10(-9) and 10(-5) M , exerted a dose-dependent antiproliferative action on HTOA cells , as measured by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA . Flow cytometric analysis indicated that Cetrorelix , at 10(-5) M , arrested cell cycle in HTOA cells , at G1 phase , after 24 h of treatment . Western blot analysis of cell cycle-regulatory proteins demonstrated that treatment with Cetrorelix ( 10(-5) M ) for 24 h did not change the steady-state levels of cyclin D1 , cyclin E , and cyclin-dependent kinase ( Cdk)4 but decreased the levels of cyclin A and Cdk2 . The protein levels of p21 ( a Cdk inhibitor ) and p53 ( a suppressor of tumor cell growth and a positive regulator for p21 expression ) were increased by Cetrorelix , but the levels of p27 ( a Cdk inhibitor ) did not change significantly . Flow cytometric analysis and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine 5-triphosphate nick end labeling staining demonstrated that Cetrorelix ( 10(-5) M ) induced apoptosis in HTOA cells . In conclusion , Cetrorelix directly inhibits the proliferation of human epithelial ovarian cancer cells through mechanisms mediated by LH-RH receptor and involving multiple events in cell cycle progression , including G1 phase cell cycle arrest coupled with down-regulation of cyclin A-Cdk2 complex levels , presumably attributable to an up-regulation of p53 and p21 protein levels and apoptosis .
Mutations in the Nf2 tumor suppressor gene lead to tumor formation in humans and mice and cellular overproliferation phenotypes in Drosophila . The Nf2 encoded protein , merlin , shares close sequence similarity in its amino terminus to members of the band 4.1 family of membrane-cytoskeletal linkers . Similarities between merlin and this family suggest a role for merlin in regulating cytoskeletal function . However , the mechanism of the tumor suppressing activity of merlin is not yet understood . Mutational analysis of Nf2 in flies has led to the identification of a dominant-negative allele , which harbors mutations in the amino terminus of the protein . Here , we report that expression of a murine analog of this amino-terminal mutant of Nf2 leads to complete transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts in culture . Cells that express this Nf2 mutant allele display disruptions of the actin cytoskeleton , lack of contact inhibition of growth , and anchorage-independent growth . Finally , fibroblasts that express this mutant Nf2 allele form tumors when injected into nude mice .
A cell line designated HUUCLEC was established from a human uterine cervical lymphoepithelial carcinoma obtained from a 61-year-old Japanese woman . The cell line has grown slowly without interruption and serial passages were successively carried out 60 times within 3 years . The cultured cells were spindle or round in shape , showing anaplastic and pleomorphic features , a pavement cell arrangement and multilayering without contact inhibition . The population doubling time of the HUUCLEC line was 72 hours while the chromosomal number varied widely and showed aneuploidy . The modal chromosomal number was stable at the triploid range and marker chromosomes were present ; the Ebstein-Barr virus was absent in the cultured cells .
A key issue in the development of the central nervous system ( CNS ) is understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating cell number . The present study examines the role of CD81 ( previously known as TAPA , the target of the antiproliferative antibody ) in the control of brain size and glial cell number . CD81 is a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins . This group of small membrane proteins is associated with the regulation of cell migration and mitotic activity . Glial cells express CD81 , and antibodies directed against this protein suppress the mitotic activity of cultured cells . In this study , we examine the effects of the CD81 -/- mutation on the CNS of mature mice . These mice have extremely large brains , as much as 30% larger than the brains of wild-type ( +/+ ) littermates . The increase in brain weight is accompanied by an increase in the number astrocytes and microglia , whereas the number of neurons and oligodendrocytes in the CD81 -/- animals appears to be normal . When the CD81 -/- mutation is placed on different genetic backgrounds , there is a remarkable range in the penetrance of the null allele phenotype , demonstrating that the mutation can be affected by modifier loci . This work provides support for the role of CD81 in the regulation of astrocyte and microglial number , perhaps by regulating cell proliferation by a contact inhibition-dependent mechanism .
We used cDNA-based genomic microarrays to examine DNA copy number changes in a panel of prostate tumors and found a previously undescribed amplicon on chromosome 17 containing a novel overexpressed gene that we termed prostate cancer gene 17 ( PRC17 ) . When overexpressed in 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells , PRC17 induced growth in low serum , loss of contact inhibition , and tumor formation in nude mice . The PRC17 gene product contains a GTPase-activating protein ( GAP ) catalytic core motif found in various Rab/Ypt GAPs , including RN-Tre . Similar to RN-Tre , we found that PRC17 protein interacts directly with Rab5 and stimulates its GTP hydrolysis . Point mutations that alter conserved amino acid residues within the PRC17 GAP domain abolished its transforming abilities , suggesting that GAP activity is essential for its oncogenic function . Whereas PRC17 is amplified in 15% of prostate cancers , it is highly overexpressed in approximately one-half of metastatic prostate tumors . The potent oncogenic activity of PRC17 is likely to influence the tumorigenic phenotype of these prostate cancers .
In human colorectal adenomas or polyps , cyclooxygenase-2 is expressed predominantly by stromal ( or interstitial ) macrophages . Therefore , we tested the hypothesis that macrophage cyclooxygenase-2 has paracrine pro-tumorigenic activity using in vitro models of macrophage-epithelial cell interactions . We report that macrophages can promote tumorigenic progression of intestinal epithelial cells ( evidenced by decreased cell-cell contact inhibition , increased proliferation and apoptosis , gain of anchorage-independent growth capability , decreased membranous E-cadherin expression , up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression , down-regulation of transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor expression and resistance to the anti-proliferative activity of transforming growth factor-beta(1) ) in a paracrine , cyclooxygenase-2-dependent manner . Pharmacologically relevant concentrations ( 1-2 microM ) of a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor had no detectable , direct effect on intestinal epithelial cells but inhibited the macrophage-epithelial cell signal mediating tumorigenic progression . Cyclooxygenase-2-mediated stromal-epithelial cell signalling during the early stages of intestinal tumorigenesis provides a novel target for chemoprevention of colorectal cancer ( and other gastro-intestinal epithelial malignancies , which arise on a background of chronic inflammation , such as gastric cancer ) and may explain the discrepancy between the concentrations of cyclooxygenase inhibitors required to produce anti-neoplastic effects in vitro and in vivo .
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) is the most potent tumor promoter ever tested in rodents . Although it is known that most of TCDD actions are mediated by binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) , the mechanisms leading to tumor promotion still remain to be elucidated . Loss of contact inhibition is one characteristic hallmark in tumorigenesis . In rat liver epithelial WB-F344 cells , TCDD induces a release from contact inhibition , which is manifested by a twofold increase in cell number when TCDD ( 1 nM for 48 h ) is added to confluent cells in the presence of serum , but not when given to exponentially growing or subconfluent , serum-deprived WB-F344 cells . Loss of G1 arrest was also shown by flow cytometric analysis . We demonstrate that TCDD treatment significantly increases cyclin D2 and cyclin A protein levels and show by immunofluorescence that these proteins accumulate in the nucleus . Although TCDD treatment leads to a strong increase in cyclin D2/cdk4 and cyclin A/cdk2 complex formation , we could only detect an elevation of cyclin A/cdk2 activity . In accordance with a lack of elevated cdk4 activity , no decrease in the amount of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein could be shown after TCDD treatment . The importance of increased cyclin A/cdk2 activity for TCDD-dependent release from contact inhibition was shown by the fact that the cdk2/cdc2-specific inhibitor olomoucine ( 25 microM ) abolished TCDD response . These data indicate cyclin A-dependent loss of G1 arrest after TCDD treatment mainly downstream of the retinoblastoma protein .
Alterations of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene are common in some forms of cancer and the most frequent is a deletion of exons 2-7 . We have previously shown that this mutant receptor , called DeltaEGFR , confers enhanced tumorigenicity to glioblastoma cells through elevated proliferation and reduced apoptotic rates of the tumor cells in vivo . To understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie DeltaEGFR-enhanced proliferation , we examined the gene products that control cell cycle progression . We found that levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor , p27 , were lower in U87MG.DeltaEGFR tumors than in parental U87MG or control U87MG.DK tumors . Consequently , CDK2-cyclin A activity was also elevated , concomitant with the RB protein hyperphosphorylation . In addition , activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-K ) and phosphorylated Akt levels were also elevated in the U87MG.DeltaEGFR tumors . U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells failed to arrest in G(1) in response to serum starvation in vitro and while maintaining high levels of PI3-K activity and hyperphosphorylated RB . Treatment of U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells with LY294002 , a PI3-K inhibitor , caused reduced levels of phosphorylated Akt and concomitantly up-regulated levels of p27 . Expression of a kinase dead dominant-negative Akt mutant in the U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells similarly resulted in up-regulation of p27 and down-regulation of tumorigenicity in vivo . These results suggest that the constitutively active DeltaEGFR can enhance cell proliferation in part by down-regulation of p27 through activation of the PI3-K/Akt pathway . This pathway may represent another therapeutic target for treatment of those aggressive glioblastomas expressing DeltaEGFR .
AIM To investigate the progressive transformation of immortal cells of human fetal esophageal epithelium induced by human papillomavirus , and to examine biological criteria of sequential passage of cells , including cellular phenotype , proliferative rate , telomerase , chromosome and tumorigenicity . METHODS The SHEE cell series consisted of immortalized embryonic esophageal epithelium which was in malignant transformation when cultivated over sixty passages without co-carcinogens . Cells of the 10th , 31st , 60th and 85th passages were present in progressive development after being transfected with HPV . Cells were cultivated in a culture flask and 24-hole cultural plates . Progressive changes of morphology , cell growth , contact-inhibition , and anchorage-dependent growth characteristics were examined by phase contrast microscopy . The cell proliferation rate was assayed by flow cytometry . The modal number of chromosomes was analyzed . HPV18E(6)E(7) was detected by Western blot methods and activities of telomerase were analyzed by TRAP . Tumorigenicity of cells was detected with soft agar plates cultivated and with tumor formation in SCID mice . RESULTS In morphological examination the 10th passage cells were in good differentiation , the 60th and 85th passages cells were in relatively poor differentiation , and the 31st passage cells had two distinct differentiations . The characteristics of the 85th and 60th passage cells were weakened at contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth . Karyotypes of four stages of cells belonged to hyperdiploid or hypotriploid , and bimodal distribution of chromosomes appeared in the 31st and 60th passage cells . All of these characteristics combined with a increasing trend . The activities of telomerase were expressed in the latter three passages . Four fourths of SCID mice in the 85th passage cells and one fourth of SCID mice in the 60th passage cells developed tumors , but the cells in the 10th and 31st passage displayed no tumor formation . CONCLUSION In continual cultivation of fetal esophageal epithelial cells with transduction of HPV18E(6)E(7) , cells from the 10th to the 85th passage were changed gradually from preimmortal , immortal , precancerous to malignantly transformed stages . All of these changes were in a dynamic progressive process . The establishment of a continuous line of esophageal epithelium may provide a in vitro model of carcinogenesis induced by HPV .
Deregulation of D-type cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDK4 and 6 ) is widely observed in various human cancers , illustrating their importance in cell cycle control . Like other cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ) , assembly with cyclins is the most critical step for activation of CDK4/6 . As previously reported elsewhere , we observed that the level of cyclinD1-CDK4 complex and its associated kinase activity were significantly low in asynchronously proliferating mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking both p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) ( p21/p27-null MEFs ) . These evidences imply that p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) CDK inhibitors are ' essential activators ' of cyclin D-kinases . We , however , discovered here that both the assembly and activation of cyclin D1-CDK4 complex occur when quiescent p21/p27-null MEFs were stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle . This mitogen-induced cyclin D1-kinase activity was blocked by overexpression of p16(INK4a) and resulted in the inhibition of S phase entry in p21/p27-null MEFs . Furthermore , ectopic expression of p34(SEI-1) , a mitogen-induced CDK4 binding protein , increased the levels of active cyclinD1-CDK4 complex in asynchronously proliferating p21/p27-null MEFs . Together , our results suggest that there are several independent ways to stimulate the assembly of cyclin D1-CDK4 kinases . Although p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) play a role in this process , our results demonstrate that additional mechanisms must occur in G0 to S phase transition .
AIM The study was designed to explore the effects of antisense human telomerase RNA ( ahTR ) on the malignant phenotype of gastric carcinoma cell line SGC-7901 , and its potential role in gene therapy for tumors . METHODS An ahTR eukaryotic expression vector , including the sequence of template region of telomere repeats , was constructed by recombinant technology of molecules and then transfected into gastric carcinoma cell line SGC-7901 by liposome DOTAP . Subsequently , the expression of hTR RNA and ahTR RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction , telomerase activity by telomeric repeat amplification protocol-ELISA ( TRAP-ELISA ) , telomere length by Southern blotting , cell morphology under light microscope , cellular proliferation capacity by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2 thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay , cell-cycle distribution by flow cytometry , efficiency of clone formation in soft agar , and tumorigenecity in nude mice were examined and evaluated in ahTR-transfected cells , control plasmid pCI-neo transfected cells and their parental cells . RESULTS An ahTR eukaryotic expression vector was constructed and successfully transfected into SGC-7901 cells . The telomerase activity in ahTR-transfected SGC-7901 cells decreased from 100% to approximately 25% , and telomere length in the cells shortened to 3.35 from 4.08 Kb at 60 population doublings . Compared with the parental cells and pCI-neo transfected cells , ahTR-transfected cells displayed some morphological changes , such as decreased atypia , and recovery of contact inhibition and density inhibition under light microscope . Furthermore , ahTR-transfected cells displayed decreased invasive capacity in Borden's chamber invasive model , increased G0/G1 phase rate and apoptotic rate . Surprisingly , ahTR-transfected SGC-7901 cells lost their capacity for clone formation in soft agar and tumorigencity in nude mice . CONCLUSION Antisense-hTR transfection can inhibit the growth of SGC-7901 cells and partially reverse the malignant phenotypes . This study provides an exciting approach for cancer therapy by inhibiting telomerase activity using an antisense gene .
During mitotic exit , a small GTPase Tem1 needs to be activated . During most of the cell cycle , Tem1 activity is antagonized by a GTPase activating complex ( GAP ) composed of Bub2 and Bfa1 . Bfa1 protein has cell cycle regulated phosphorylation depending upon the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 . This phosphorylation dissociates Bfa1 from Tem1 and thus relieves the inhibition of Tem1 by the GAP complex . Bub2 and Bfa1 are also required to prevent mitotic exit when there is DNA damage , spindle damage or spindle misorientation at G(2)/M phase . While Cdc5 inhibits Bfa1/Bub2 , mutating the Cdc5 phosphorylation sites on Bfa1 does not have a strong activating effect on Bub2/Bfa1 , suggesting there must be additional regulation in this pathway . Here we report that Bub2 protein also has cell cycle regulated phosphorylation . This phosphorylation is partially dependent upon the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 and is consistent with negative regulation of the Bub2/Bfa1 GAP complex . Spindle damage or spindle misorientation prevents Bub2 phosphorylation . The spindle damage effect is dependent upon the spindle assembly checkpoint components Mad2 and Mps1 . Thus like Bfa1 , Bub2 protein is also controlled both during mitotic exit and in response to cell cycle checkpoints . Bub2 phosphorylation is likely to be controlled by a novel kinase .
Recent studies indicate that cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) is overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and may play a critical role in this rapidly progressing form of cancer . A human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line , Mia PaCa-2 , was incubated for 18 hours with 5 micromol/L of rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) , a selective COX-2 inhibitor . Total RNA was isolated and gene expression analyzed by DNA microarray chips . In a separate experiment , athymic mice were orthotopically injected with 7.5 x 10(5) Mia PaCa-2 cells through a minilaparotomy . After 1 month , laparotomy was repeated to measure tumor size , and mice were randomized to receive reformulated rodent chow containing either 12.5 mg/kg/day of rofecoxib or no drug for 21 days . Tumor growth was assessed by comparing volume before and after treatment . In vitro , rofecoxib decreased gene expression of cyclin D1/PRAD1 , a key component of cell cycle progression , while increasing expression of several cell cycle arrest genes , including p21/WAF1 , p33/ING , GADD34 , and GADD45 ( P < 0.05 ) . In vivo , tumor growth was significantly reduced in treated vs. control mice ( P < 0.05 ) . No systemic toxicity was observed in mice receiving rofecoxib . These data suggest that rofecoxib slows the growth of human pancreatic cancer through changes in gene expression that favor cell cycle arrest .
Cancer-prone diseases ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT ) , Nijmegen breakage syndrome ( NBS ) and ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder ( ATLD ) are defective in the repair of DNA double-stranded break ( DSB ) . On the other hand , arsenic ( As ) has been reported to cause DSB and to be involved in the occurrence of skin , lung and bladder cancers . To dissect the repair mechanism of As-induced DSB , wild type , AT and NBS cells were treated with sodium arsenite to study the complex formation and post-translational modification of Rad50/NBS1/Mre11 repair proteins . Our results showed that Mre11 went through cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation upon sodium arsenite treatment and this post-translational modification required NBS1 but not ATM . Defective As-induced Mre11 phosphorylation was rescued by reconstitution with full length NBS1 in NBS cells . Although As-induced Mre11 phosphorylation was not required for Rad50/NBS1/Mre11 complex formation , it might be required for the formation of Rad50/NBS1/Mre11 nuclear foci upon DNA damage .
To explore the possibility of a new therapeutic strategy for leukemia by intervening in the DNA methylation to re-express p15 suppressor gene , methylation inhibitors , 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5-Aza-CdR ) and cell differentiation agent ( CDAII ) were used to treat myelogenous leukemia cell line KG1a in which p15 gene expression was suppressed due to DNA hypermethylation . The biological characteristics of KG1a cells untreated or treated with the agents were investigated and analyzed using morphology , methylation specific-PCR ( MSP ) , ( 3)H-labeled microassay technique , restriction endonuclease reaction , flow cytometry and immunofluorescence methods . The results indicated that both agents showed concentration-dependent and time-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. 5-Aza-CdR and CDAII induced apoptosis and cell differentiation with G(2) and G(0)/G(1) arrest respectively . Furthermore , DNA methyltransferase activity and level of methylation in genomic DNA were decreased and p15 protein was re-expressed partially . It is concluded that it is possible to treat leukemia by intervening in the DNA methylation using methyltransferase inhibitors and it is worth to make a thorough study on mechanism of the new strategy .
Free radical-induced cellular stress contributes to cancer during chronic inflammation . Here , we investigated mechanisms of p53 activation by the free radical , NO . NO from donor drugs induced both ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM)- and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related-dependent p53 posttranslational modifications , leading to an increase in p53 transcriptional targets and a G(2)M cell cycle checkpoint . Such modifications were also identified in cells cocultured with NO-releasing macrophages . In noncancerous colon tissues from patients with ulcerative colitis ( a cancer-prone chronic inflammatory disease ) , inducible NO synthase protein levels were positively correlated with p53 serine 15 phosphorylation levels . Immunostaining of HDM-2 and p21(WAF1) was consistent with transcriptionally active p53 . Our study highlights a pivotal role of NO in the induction of cellular stress and the activation of a p53 response pathway during chronic inflammation .
Like all cancers , breast cancer is considered to result in part from the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations leading to oncogene overexpression and tumor suppressor loss . More recently , CpG island hypermethylation is known to be associated with gene silencing in cancer , and these silenced genes can be reactivated by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5-Aza-CdR ) . Retionoic acid receptor beta 2 gene is a tumor suppressor gene and the chemopreventive effects of retinoids are due to induction of RAR beta 2 . In this study , the effect of 5-Aza-CdR RAR beta 2 restoration was investigated in the MRK-nu-1 human female breast cancer cell line . Changes of the RAR beta 2 methylation status were assessed by methylation-specific PCR . Reverse transcription PCR was used to evaluate RARb beta 2 restoration . Cell cycling and growth inhibition were studied using flow cytometric analysis of DNA content and CellTiter 96 AQueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay , respectively. 5-Aza-CdR treatment resulted in complete demethylation of the RAR beta 2 gene . RAR beta 2 restoration was accompanied by cell cycle arrest ( increase in the G0/G1- and decrease in the S- and G2/M-phases ) and time-dependent growth inhibition . In conclusion , RAR beta 2 can be activated in vitro by 5-Aza-CdR , which may be one of the mechanisms for the tumor cell growth inhibition by 5-Aza-CdR .
The vinorelbine sensitivity of eight recently established head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) cell lines was tested using the 96-well plate clonogenic assay . The chemosensitivity of these head and neck SCC cell lines to vinorelbine expressed as IC50 , corresponding to the drug concentration causing 50% inhibition in clonogenic survival , varied between 0.6 and 1.0 nM . The dose-dependent growth inhibition caused by vinorelbine was measured in three of these cell lines . A clear growth inhibition was observed at a concentration of 3 nM . The same cell lines were studied with flow cytometry . When exposed to 3 nM and 5 nM vinorelbine , an accumulation of the cells in the G2/M-phase was observed in all cultures after 12 hours . The morphological changes induced by 3 nM and 5 nM vinorelbine to the UT-SCC-33 cell line were analysed with time-lapse video microscopy . In the cultures treated with 5 nM vinorelbine , the cells stayed mitotically arrested for 2-32 hours and thereafter died morphologically by apoptosis . These results indicate that , in vitro , the head and neck SCC is consistently sensitive to vinorelbine , which blocks the cell cycle in G2/M , the most radiosensitive phase . These encouraging results suggest that vinorelbine may potentially be used in conjunction with radiotherapy in the treatment of head and neck SCC .
We have recently identified ICBP90 as being a protein able to bind in vitro a CCAAT box of the topoisomerase II alpha gene promoter . The aim of the present work was to check whether ICBP90 is able to regulate in vivo topoisomerase II alpha expression in human lung fibroblasts under various proliferating conditions . Transient transfection experiments performed on moderately growing human lung fibroblasts ( 50% of confluence ) showed that overexpression of ICBP90 is associated with an elevation of topoisomerase II alpha expression and an increase of the cell proliferation rate . In highly proliferating human lung fibroblasts ( 20% confluence ) overexpression of ICBP90 had no effect . In contrast , in non-proliferating fibroblasts ( 100% confluence ) overexpression of ICBP90 allowed recovery of topoisomerase II alpha expression levels with a concomitant overgrowth of confluent cell cultures . Our results show that ICBP90 regulates topoisomerase II alpha expression and is able to overcome cell contact inhibition signaling , suggesting that increased ICBP90 expression may be involved in carcinogenesis .
Chinese medicinal herbs are traditionally used to prevent and treat a variety of diseases , including cancer . These herbal preparations are purported to have many biological effects including direct antiproliferative effects on cancer cells , anti-mutagenic activity , and stimulatory or suppressive effects on immune responses . The present study investigates the effects of aqueous extracts from seventy-one Chinese medicinal herbs on the growth of five breast cancer cell lines ( SK-BR-3 , MCF7 , MDA-MB-231 , BT-474 and MCNeuA ) . Twenty-one percent ( 15 out of 71 ) of the extracts demonstrated greater than 50% growth inhibition on at least 4 of the 5 cell lines . Dose-response curves were obtained for several of the most potent crude extracts and demonstrated IC50 values ranging from < 10 micrograms/ml to > 1 mg/ml . Six of seven herbs tested induced high molecular weight DNA fragmentation , an early marker of apoptosis , while one of these also induced low molecular weight DNA fragmentation . Flow cytometric analysis of breast cancer cells exposed to one of these herbs ( Rheum palmatum ) suggested that it arrests cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle . These results indicate that many of the herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of cancer have significant growth inhibitory effects on breast cancer cells in vitro .
We examined the inducibility of drug resistance ( MDR1 , MRP1 , LRP ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ) isozyme ( alpha , epsilon , eta , theta , tau , zeta ) corresponding genes in A2780 ovarian cancer cells after a 24-hour treatment with adriamycin ( ADR ) , camptothecin ( CAM ) , etoposide ( ETO ) or vincristine ( VCR ) . Sublethal concentrations of drugs were used to exclude short-term effects caused by selection . Cell cycle analysis was performed to identify possible correlation between resistance factors , PKC isozymes and proliferation . We found a mostly combined induction of MDR1 , LRP , PKC tau and PKC zeta by CAM , ETO and VCR . PKC alpha , epsilon , eta and theta gene expression altered variably . Cell cycle analysis showed that A2780 cells responded with a marked G2/M arrest after a 24-hour treatment with CAM , ETO and VCR but an association between the induction of PKC isozymes corresponding genes and proliferation was not seen . Our analysis points to a possible link between atypical PKC tau/PKC zeta and MDR1/LRP in cytostatic stress response of cancer cells .
The effects of tea polyphenols and tea pigments on cell cycle of hepatic cancer cells were studied . HepG2 cells were incubated with 50 and 100 mg/L tea polyphenols and tea pigments for 48 h respectively . Flow cytometry , Western blot and RT-PCR analysis were used . Flow cytometry analysis showed that tea polyphenols and tea pigments induced G1 arrest . Western blot analysis showed tea polyphenols and tea pigments significantly inhibited the expression of cyclin D1 protein and induced higher expression of P21WAFI/CIPI protein . The result of RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that Cdk4 was significantly inhibited by tea polyphenols and tea pigments . It is concluded that the induction of cell cycle arrest may be an important mechanism of tea on cancer prevention .
ZBP-89 ( ZNF148 ) is a Zinc finger Binding Protein of 89 kDa that binds GC-rich DNA elements . Originally , it was expression cloned using a DNA element mediating EGF regulation of the gastrin promoter . ZBP-89 functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor . A variety of extracellular regulators including TGFbeta , retinoic acid and butyrate stimulate ZBP-89 gene expression . Butyrate activation of p21WAF1 is potentiated by ZBP-89 through the recruitment of the co-activator p300 , while chronic stimulation by butyrate increases ZBP-89 gene expression correlating with cell differentiation . ZBP-89 stimulates growth arrest and apoptosis through its ability to bind the p21WAF1 promoter or its ability to form protein-protein interactions with p53 . ZBP-89 protein is elevated in a variety of gastrointestinal cancers as well as the pancreas . In particular , ZBP-89 is normally expressed in pancreatic islets and ducts and in about 30% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas .
The identification of molecular markers related to critical biological processes during carcinogenesis may aid in the evaluation of carcinogenic potentials of chemicals and chemical mixtures . Work from our laboratory demonstrated that a single treatment with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine ( MNNG ) enhanced spontaneous malignant transformation of the human keratinocyte cell line RHEK-1 . In contrast , chronic low-level exposure of cells to arsenic alone or in a mixture containing arsenic , cadmium , chromium , and lead inhibited malignant conversion . To identify changes in gene expression that influence these different outcomes , cDNA microarray technology was used . Analysis of multiple human arrays in MNNG-transformed RHEK-1 cells , designated OM3 , and those treated with arsenic or the arsenic-containing metal mixture showed unique patterns of gene expression . Genes that were overexpressed in OM3 included oncogenes , cell cycle regulators , and those involved in signal transduction , whereas genes for DNA repair enzymes and inhibitors of transformation and metastasis were suppressed . In arsenic-treated cells , multiple DNA repair proteins were overexpressed . Mixture-treated cells showed increased expression of a variety of genes including metallothioneins and integrin 4 . These cells showed decreased expression of oncogenes , DNA repair proteins , and genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway . For comparison we are currently analyzing gene expression changes in RHEK-1 cells transformed by other means . The goal of these studies is to identify common batteries of genes affected by chemical modulators of the carcinogenic process . Mechanistic studies may allow us to correlate alterations in their expression with sequential stages in the carcinogenic process and may aid in the risk assessment of other xenobiotics .
We present a new cell line , EJ established from an invasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus in a 56-year-old patient . The cells show rapid growth in culture with a doubling time of 16 h and high migration activity . Monolayer-cultured cells were polygonal in shape showing a tendency to pile up without contact inhibition . Subcutaneous transplantation of the EJ cells into nude mice formed solid tumors that were histologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma , whereas no metastasis was observed . Cultured EJ cells produced tissue polypeptide antigen ( IPA ) . Genetic and molecular analyses revealed high telomerase activity but not estrogen receptor alpha expression . Using the DNA sequencing technique , we have screened EJ cells for p53 mutation in exon 5 to 8 but no mutation of p53 was observed . This cell line appears to represent the development of a more malignant clone with divergent receptor function and growth behavior , and provides us with an interesting new tool for the study of tumorigenesis in the human endometrium .
Earlier studies indicated that density-arrested cancer cells released an unidentified growth inhibitor whose secretion was prevented by overexpression of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D ( cath D ) . In this study , this growth inhibitor was purified by affinity chromatography and identified as the heat shock cognate 70 protein ( hsc70 ) based on its peptide microsequencing and specific antibody recognition . Among intracellular proteins , including other heat shock proteins , only constitutive hsc70 was secreted in response to the high-cell density . Moreover , hsc70 secretion from cancer cells was generated by serum deprivation , whereas its cellular concentration did not change . Prevention of Hsc70 secretion by cath D overexpression was associated with the formation of multilayer cell cultures , thus indicating a loss of contact inhibition . In addition , we showed that supplementing the culture medium with purified hsc70 inhibited cell proliferation in the nanomolar range . Conversely , removal of this extracellular hsc70 from the medium by either retention on ADP-agarose or competition at the Hsc70 binding site restored cell proliferation . Hsc70 appears active in human breast cancer cells and hypersecreted by direct cath D inhibition . These results suggest a new role of this secreted hsc70 chaperone in cell proliferation that might account for the higher tumor growth of cancer cells overexpressing cath D .
Gliomas are aggressive and almost incurable glial brain tumors which frequently display abnormal platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) signaling . Evidence gained from studies on several in vivo animal models has firmly established a causal connection between aberrant PDGF signaling and the formation of some gliomas . However , only recently has significant knowledge been gained regarding crucial issues such as the glioma cell of origin and the relationship between the transforming stimulus and the cellular characteristics of the resulting tumor . Based on recent evidence , we propose that PDGF can bias cell-fate decisions , driving the acquisition of cell type-specific features by the progeny of multipotent neural progenitors , thus determining the shape and direction of the transformation path . Furthermore , recent data about the cellular mechanisms of PDGF-driven glioma progression and maintenance indicate that PDGF may be required , unexpectedly , to override cell contact inhibition and promote glioma cell infiltration rather than to stimulate cell proliferation .
Tumor endothelial marker ( TEM ) 5 is an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor upregulated in endothelial cells during tumor and physiologic angiogenesis . So far , the mechanisms leading to upregulation of TEM5 and its function during angiogenesis have not been identified . Here , we report that TEM5 expression in endothelial cells is induced during capillary-like network formation on Matrigel , during capillary morphogenesis in a three-dimensional collagen I matrix , and upon confluence on a two-dimensional matrix . TEM5 expression was not induced by a variety of soluble angiogenic factors , including VEGF and bFGF , in subconfluent endothelial cells . TEM5 upregulation was blocked by toxin B from Clostridium difficile , an inhibitor of the small GTPases Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 . The Rho inhibitor C3 transferase from Clostridium botulinum did not affect TEM5 expression , whereas the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 suppressed TEM5 upregulation . An excess of the soluble TEM5 extracellular domain or an inhibitory monoclonal TEM5 antibody blocked contact inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation resulting in multilayered islands within the endothelial monolayer and increased vessel density during capillary formation . Based on our results we conclude that TEM5 expression during capillary morphogenesis is induced by the small GTPase Rac and mediates contact inhibition of proliferation in endothelial cells .
Depleted uranium ( DU ) is commonly used in military armor and munitions , and thus , exposure of soldiers and noncombatants is frequent and widespread . Previous studies have shown that DU has both chemical and radiological toxicity and that the primary route of exposure of DU to humans is through inhalation and ingestion . However , there is limited research information on the potential carcinogenicity of DU in human bronchial cells . Accordingly , we determined the neoplastic transforming ability of particulate DU to human bronchial epithelial cells ( BEP2D ) . We observed the loss of contact inhibition and anchorage independent growth in cells exposed to DU after 24 h . We also characterized these DU-induced transformed cell lines and found that 40% of the cell lines exhibit alterations in plating efficiency and no significant changes in the cytotoxic response to DU . Cytogenetic analyses showed that 53% of the DU-transformed cell lines possess a hypodiploid phenotype . These data indicate that human bronchial cells are transformed by DU and exhibit significant chromosome instability consistent with a neoplastic phenotype .
Odontogenic tumors originate from the remains of migrating enamel epithelium after the completion of normal tooth genesis . These enamel epithelium remnants exhibit the ability to recapitulate the events that occur during tooth formation . Several lines of evidence suggest that aberrance in the signaling pathways similar to the ones that are used during tooth development , including the WNT pathway , might be the cause of odontogenic tumorigenesis and maintenance . In this study we demonstrated that WNT5A expression was intense in both the epithelial component of ameloblastomas , the most common epithelial odontogenic tumor , and in this tumor's likely precursor cell , the enamel epithelium located at the cervical loop of normal developing human tooth buds . Additionally , when WNT5A was overexpressed in enamel epithelium cells ( LS-8 ) , the clones expressing high levels of WNT5A ( S ) exhibited characteristics of tumorigenic cells , including growth factor independence , loss of anchorage dependence , loss of contact inhibition , and tumor formation in immunocompromised mice . Moreover , overexpression of WNT5A drastically increased LS-8 cell migration and actin reorganization when compared with controls . Suppression of endogenous WNT5A in LS-8 cells ( AS ) greatly impaired their migration and AS cells failed to form significant actin reorganization and membrane protrusion was rarely seen . Taken together , our data indicate that WNT5A signaling is important in modulating tumorigenic behaviors of enamel epithelium cells in ameloblastomas .
The present study was designed to investigate the protective efficacy of eugenol against skin cancer and probe into the mechanistic aspects . Skin tumors were initiated by applying 160 nmol DMBA and promoted by twice weekly applications of 8.5 nmol TPA for 28 wk . All mice developed tumors by 13 wk of promotion . However , in mice pretreated with 30 microL eugenol , no tumors were detected until 8 wk ( following anti-initiation protocol ) and until 14 wk ( following antipromotion protocol ) of tumor promotion . PCNA and TUNEL immunohistochemistry of tumors revealed eugenol to ameliorate cell proliferation and elevate apoptosis respectively . The effect of eugenol was assessed on specific stages of carcinogenesis . Initiation with DMBA led to a significant upregulation of p53 expression with a concomitant increase in p21(WAF1) levels in epidermal cells indicating induction of damage to the DNA . However , pretreatment with eugenol led to overexpression of these genes , which probably helped stimulate apoptosis of the initiated cells . To ascertain the molecular mechanisms implicated in the antitumor promoting activity of eugenol , its effect was investigated on markers of tumor promotion and inflammation : ODC activity and iNOS and COX-2 expression , and on levels of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-6 , TNF-alpha , and PGE(2) ) . Eugenol markedly inhibited all . Eugenol also inhibited the upstream signaling molecule : NF-kappaB , which regulates the expression of these genes . TPA-induced depletion of cutaneous GSH and antioxidant enzymes armory was also precluded by eugenol . From these results , it could be concluded that eugenol markedly protects against chemically induced skin cancer and acts possibly by virtue of its antiproliferative , anti-inflammatory , and antioxidant activities .
Histone H3 methylation at lysine 4 ( K4 ) is associated with euchromatic regions and is thought to be important for the transcriptional activation of genes during differentiation . In this study , we found that di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 at K4 and acetylation of histones H3 and H4 from the promoter/enhancer to the transcribed region close to the transcription initiation site of the solute carrier family 2 , member 5 ( SLC2A5 ) gene , and its expression , were induced by differentiation of intestine-like Caco-2 cells . These effects were accompanied by contact inhibition of cell growth of these cells . Furthermore , these modifications were induced by co-treatment with a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone and a p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD89059 . Our results suggest that methylation of histone H3 at K4 and acetylation of histones H3 and H4 are involved in SLC2A5 gene induction associated with intestinal differentiation of Caco-2 cells .
DNA damage checkpoints arrest cell cycle progression to facilitate DNA repair . The ability to survive genotoxic insults depends not only on the initiation of cell cycle checkpoints but also on checkpoint maintenance . While activation of DNA damage checkpoints has been studied extensively , molecular mechanisms involved in sustaining and ultimately inactivating cell cycle checkpoints are largely unknown . Here , we explored feedback mechanisms that control the maintenance and termination of checkpoint function by computationally identifying an evolutionary conserved mitotic phosphorylation network within the DNA damage response . We demonstrate that the non-enzymatic checkpoint adaptor protein 53BP1 is an in vivo target of the cell cycle kinases Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 and Polo-like kinase-1 ( Plk1 ) . We show that Plk1 binds 53BP1 during mitosis and that this interaction is required for proper inactivation of the DNA damage checkpoint. 53BP1 mutants that are unable to bind Plk1 fail to restart the cell cycle after ionizing radiation-mediated cell cycle arrest . Importantly , we show that Plk1 also phosphorylates the 53BP1-binding checkpoint kinase Chk2 to inactivate its FHA domain and inhibit its kinase activity in mammalian cells . Thus , a mitotic kinase-mediated negative feedback loop regulates the ATM-Chk2 branch of the DNA damage signaling network by phosphorylating conserved sites in 53BP1 and Chk2 to inactivate checkpoint signaling and control checkpoint duration .
It is crucial for organ homeostasis that epithelia have effective mechanisms to restrict motility and cell proliferation in order to maintain tissue architecture . On the other hand , epithelial cells need to rapidly and transiently acquire a more mesenchymal phenotype , with high levels of cell motility and proliferation , in order to repair epithelia upon injury . Cross talk between cell-cell and cell-matrix signaling is crucial for regulating these transitions . The Pak1-betaPIX-GIT complex is an effector complex downstream of the small GTPase Rac1 . We previously showed that translocation of this complex from cell-matrix to cell-cell adhesion sites was required for the establishment of contact inhibition of proliferation . In this study , we provide evidence that this translocation depends on cadherin function . Cadherins do not recruit the complex by direct interaction . Rather , we found that inhibition of the normal function of cadherin or Pak1 leads to defects in focal adhesion turnover and to increased signaling by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase . We propose that cadherins are involved in regulation of contact inhibition by controlling the function of the Pak1-betaPIX-GIT complex at focal contacts .
AIM Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer in the industrial countries . Due to advances regarding the treatments , primarily development of improved surgical methods and the ability to make the earlier diagnosis , the mortality has remained constant during the past decades even though the incidence in fact has increased . To improve chemotherapy and enable personalised treatment , the need of biomarkers is of great significance . In this study , we evaluated the gene expression profiles of the colon cancer cell lines treated with SN-38 , the active metabolite of topoisomerase-1 inhibitor irinotecan which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis . MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 3 colon cancer cell lines : KM12C , KM12SM and KM12l4a . The 3 cell lines were treated with SN-38 , and samples were obtained after 24 and 48 hour treatments . The gene expression analyses were performed using oligonucleotide microarrays comprising of approximately 27,000 spots where the untreated controls were compared to the SN-38-treated samples . RESULTS Unsupervised clustering clearly distinguished the treated cell lines from the untreated . Supervised analysis identified 3,974 significant genes ( p = 0.05 ) differentiating the treated samples from the untreated , majority of which were down-regulated after treatment . The top-ranked down-regulated genes in the treated cell lines included those related to receptor and kinase activity , signal transduction , apoptosis , RNA processing , protein metabolism and transport , cell cycle and transcription . A smaller number of genes were up-regulated in the cell lines after treatment and included genes involved in apoptosis , transcription , development and differentiation . CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that the expression of the genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as RNA , DNA and protein metabolism were affected by SN-38 . The impact of certain genes on colorectal cancer development needs to be further evaluated ; however , these results could serve as a basis for further studies in order to find targets for irinotecan treatment .
Hypoxia is widespread in solid tumors as a consequence of poorly structured tumor-derived neovasculature , which is recognized to play a role in the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy . Etoposide ( VP-16 ) , a drug commonly used in chemotherapy , leads to enhanced accumulation of cell populations in G2/M phase and increases levels of apoptosis as a topoisomerase II inhibitor . We evaluated the effects of hypoxia on the response of the neuroblastoma cell line CHP126 to VP-16 , in order to delineate the mechanisms responsible for the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance of this clinically conventional anti-cancer agent , with an insight to determining potential indications in neuroblastoma therapy . In this study , physiological hypoxia was shown to attenuate G2/M arrest and apoptosis induced in CHP126 cells by VP-16 . It suppressed drug-related Cdk1 activity with a less elevation of regulator proteins such as cyclin B1 , Cdk7 and reduced caspase activation and PARP cleavage compared to the efficiency observed in normoxic condition , which were significantly relative with hypoxia-driven inhibition of p53 and p-ERK1/2 activation . These results clearly demonstrated that hypoxia had a protective effect against VP-16-induced cytotoxicity , which is likely to provide a further therapeutic knowledge in neuroblastomas .
Although anticancer effect of gambogic acid ( GA ) and its potential mechanisms were well documented in past decades , limited information is available on the anticancer effect of gambogenic acid ( GNA ) , another major active component of Gamboge . Here we performed a study to determine whether GNA possesses anticancer effect and find its potential mechanisms . The results suggested that GNA significantly inhibited the proliferation of several tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo . Treatment with GNA dose and time dependently induced A549 cells apoptosis , arrested the cells to G0/G1 phase in vitro and down-regulated the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclooxygenase ( COX)-2 in mRNA level . In addition , anticancer effect was further demonstrated by applying xenografts in nude mice coupled with the characteristic of apoptosis in the GNA treated group . Taken together , these observations might suggest that GNA inhibits tumor cell proliferation via apoptosis-induction and cell cycle arrest .
Cancer cells upregulate glycolysis , increasing glucose uptake to meet energy needs . A small fraction of a cell's glucose enters the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway ( HBP ) , which regulates levels of O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine ( O-GlcNAc ) , a carbohydrate posttranslational modification of diverse nuclear and cytosolic proteins . We discovered that breast cancer cells upregulate the HBP , including increased O-GlcNAcation and elevated expression of O-GlcNAc transferase ( OGT ) , which is the enzyme catalyzing the addition of O-GlcNAc to proteins . Reduction of O-GlcNAcation through RNA interference of OGT in breast cancer cells leads to inhibition of tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo and is associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and increased expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1) . Elevation of p27(Kip1) was associated with decreased expression and activity of the oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1 , a known regulator of p27(Kip1) stability through transcriptional control of Skp2 . Reducing O-GlcNAc levels in breast cancer cells decreased levels of FoxM1 protein and caused a decrease in multiple FoxM1-specific targets , including Skp2 . Moreover , reducing O-GlcNAcation decreased cancer cell invasion and was associated with the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 , a known FoxM1 target . Finally , pharmacological inhibition of OGT in breast cancer cells had similar anti-growth and anti-invasion effects . These findings identify O-GlcNAc as a novel mechanism through which alterations in glucose metabolism regulate cancer growth and invasion and suggest that OGT may represent novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer .
BACKGROUND Inactivation of p53 is involved in arsenite-induced tumorigenesis ; however , the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood . OBJECTIVE We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the inactivation of p53 and neoplastic transformation induced by arsenite in human embryo lung fibroblast ( HELF ) cells . METHODS Anchorage-independent growth assays were performed , and tumorigenicity in intact animals was assessed to confirm arsenite-induced neoplastic transformation . We determined the levels and functions of p53 , nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-B ; a key transcriptional regulator ) , and mot-2 ( a p53 inhibitor ) and their relationships in arsenite-induced transformed HELF cells by two-dimensional electrophoresis , reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction , Western blot , immunofluorescence , and co-immunoprecipitation assays . RESULTS Exposure of HELF cells to low levels of arsenite increased their proliferation rate and anchorage-independent growth and disrupted normal contact inhibition . When introduced into nude mice , transformed cells were tumorigenic . We used proteomic analysis to identify proteins with altered expression between untreated and arsenite-exposed cells . We found decreased expression of NF-B repressing factor ( NKRF ; an inhibitor of NF-B-mediated gene transcription ) , increased expression of mot-2 , and increased activation of NF-B . Changes in cells exposed to 1.0 microM arsenite were more marked than changes in cells exposed to 0.5 or 2.0 microM arsenite . Inactivation of NF-B prevented malignant transformation induced by 1.0 microM arsenite . Moreover , we also identified a mechanism whereby NF-B regulated p53 . Specifically , activation of NF-B up-regulated mot-2 expression , which prevented nuclear translocation of p53 and switched the binding preference of the p53 and NF-B coactivator CBP [ cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) binding protein ] from p53 to NF-B . CONCLUSIONS mot-2-mediated cross talk between NF-B and p53 appears to be involved in arsenite-induced tumorigenesis of HELF cells .
The tumor suppressor p27(Kip1) is an inhibitor of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) complexes and plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation . Nevertheless , p27 function in the tumorigenesis of the uterine cervix has been poorly defined . Some phenomenon hints that HPV E7 protein can enhance p27 expression , which is contradictory to HPV E7's property of increasing cell proliferation rate . So , in the present study , we have examined the effect of E7 on p27 expression . Though the levels of p27 are increased after HPV E7 expression , most of the p27 protein localized in the cytoplasm and have no function on cell cycle arrest and contact inhibition . The cell migration rate is elevated when p27 is high expression and located in cytoplasm . The results indicated that E7-p27 interaction not only abolished the p27's cell cycle inhibitory function by sequestering it to the cytoplasm , but also endow the cell with invasive property which is the feature of malignant cells .
BACKGROUND The pTalpha/preTCR regulates the beta-selection , a crucial T-cell developmental checkpoint , providing a most potent survival advantage to thymocytes mediated by the src-kinase p56(Lck) . METHODS To define the relevance of pTalpha in human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) , we analyzed in T-ALL cell lines ( n=14 ) pTalpha and p56(Lck) mRNA and protein expression as also the tyrosine-phosphorylation . The p56(Lck) specific src-protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( PTK-I ) PP1 was used in growth inhibition assays . IC(50) value determination , cell cycle- and apoptosis analyses were performed in T-ALL- , non-T-ALL- and murine transgenic cell lines . RESULTS pTalpha expression patterns were markedly different in T-ALL cell lines as compared to those reported for normal lymphoid counterparts . PP1 induced in 6/11 T-ALL cell lines a survival disadvantage resulting from a cell cycle arrest in the G(1/0) phase in thymic lymphoblastic cells and apoptosis induction in the immature cell line HSB-2 , respectively . PP1 sensitive cell lines expressed the target protein p56(Lck) and showed a corresponding P-Tyr signal . CONCLUSION Sensitivity of thymic T-ALLs to PP1 clearly underlines the impact of pTalpha mediated proliferation in this leukemic sub-type . In addition , p56(Lck) represents also independently of pTalpha a promising therapeutical target for the src-kinase inhibitors in neoplastic lymphoid diseases .
Prostate cancer ( PCA ) is the most common invasive malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in males . The present study investigated the effects of fangchinoline ( Fan ) , an important compound in Stephania Tetradra S. Moore ( Fenfangji ) with pain-relieving , blood pressure-depressing , and antibiotic activities , on human PCA . It was found that Fan inhibited human prostate cancer cell lines ( PC3 ) cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner . Studies of cell-cycle progression showed that the anti-proliferative effect of Fan was associated with an increase in the G1/S phase of PC3 cells . Western blot results indicated that Fan-induced G1/S phase arrest was mediated through inhibition of cyclin-regulated signaling pathways . Fan induced p27 expression and inhibited cyclin D and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) expression in PC3 cells . Increased exposure time to Fan caused apoptosis of PC3 cells , which was associated with up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and caspase 3 , and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 . Furthermore , Fan had anti-tumorigenic activity in vivo , including reduction of tumor volume and pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects in a PC3 nude mouse xenograft . Taking all this together , it can be concluded that Fan is an effective anti-proliferative agent that modulates cell growth regulators in prostate cancer cells .
OBJECTIVE To study the effects of genistein on the proliferation , apoptosis induction and expression of related gene proteins of human colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo , and its mechanisms of action . METHODS MTT colorimetric assay was used to detect the effects of genistein on the proliferation of human colon adenocarcinoma SW480 cells . Light and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the histological and ultrastructural changes . Flow cytometry was used to determine the effects of genistein on cell cycle and apoptosis . Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the effects of genistein on apoptosis induction and expression of related gene proteins of colon cancer cells . RESULTS The MTT colorimetric assay showed that genistein inhibited the proliferation of SW480 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner , and the highest inhibition rate was 60.2% after 80 microg/ml genistein treatment for 72 h . The light microscopy revealed that many genistein-treated cancer cells were shrunken , disrupted , or showing cytoplasmic vacuolization . The electron microscopic examination showed cell shrinkage , nuclear fragmentation and pronounced chromatin condensation , sometimes formed crescent chromatin condensation attached to the nuclear membrane . The results of flow cytometry showed that : after SW480 cells were treated with 0 , 20 , 40 , 80 microg/ml genistein for 48 h , the FI values of PCNA were 1.49 +/- 0.02 , 1.28 +/- 0.04 , 1.14 +/- 0.03 , and 0.93 +/- 0.08 ; the FI values of VEGF were 1.75 +/- 0.02 , 1.34 +/- 0.06 , 1.32 +/- 0.04 , and 1.23 +/- 0.04 ; the fluorescence index ( FI ) values of p21 were 1.26 +/- 0.05 , 1.36 +/- 0.06 , 1.61 +/- 0.03 , and 1.73 +/- 0.03 , respectively . There were statistically significant differences between the control group and each treatment group ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) . The scores of immunohistochemical staining of PCNA and VEGF proteins were decreased , while p21 increased . There were statistically significant differences between the control group and each treatment group ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSION Genistein can inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells via apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase . The anti-tumor mechanisms of genistein may be related with the down-regulation of expression of VEGF and PCNA , and up-regulation of the expression of p21 .
In the present study , we investigated if the intracellular Cl(-) affects cell growth and cell cycle progression of androgen-independent prostate cancer PC3 cells . PC3 cells cultured in a medium containing 113 mM Cl(-) for 96 h grew up 9-fold in cell number , while PC3 cells cultured in an 8 mM-Cl(-)-containing culture medium showed complete arrest of cell growth even after culture for 96 h . Exposure of cells to the 8 mM-Cl(-) culture medium diminished phosphorylation levels of Rb and cdc2 , which are respectively key accelerators of transition from G(1) to S phase and G(2) to M phase in cell cycle progression . Culturing cells in the 8 mM-Cl(-)-containing culture medium upregulated the protein expression level of p21 ( a CDK inhibitor ) inhibiting transition of G(1) to S phase , and diminished the incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine ( EdU ; a thymidine analogue ) into DNA . These results suggest that cells cultured in the low Cl(-) medium prolonged the duration of all phases of the cell cycle ( G(1) , S , and G(2)/M ) , thereby abolishing overall cell cycle progression . Effects of culturing cells in the low Cl(-) culture medium on cell cycle progression would be mediated via a change in the intracellular Cl(-) concentration ( [ Cl(-)](i) ) , since [ Cl(-)](i) was decreased under a low Cl(-) culture medium . To clarify this possibility , we studied effects of furosemide and bumetanide , Na+/K+/2Cl(-) cotransporter ( NKCC ) inhibitors , on proliferation of PC3 cells . Furosemide and bumetanide decreased [ Cl(-)](i) and cell growth of PC3 cells . These results suggest that a change in [ Cl(-)](i) would play a critical role in this growth mechanism .
Palmitoylation is required for the activities of several cancer-associated proteins , making the palmitoyl acyltransferase ( PAT ) enzymes that catalyze these reactions potential targets for anticancer therapeutics . In this study , we sought to identify and characterize a human PAT with activity toward N-terminally myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins . NIH/3t3 cells were stably transfected with vectors containing no insert , wild type human DHHC20 , or a serine-substituted DHHS20 mutant . Compared with control cells , cells overexpressing wild-type DHHC20 displayed an increase in palmitoylation activity toward a peptide that mimics the N-terminus of myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins , but had no change in activity toward a peptide that mimics the C-terminus of farnesylated and palmitoylated proteins . Cells expressing DHHS20 had no significant change in activity toward either peptide . Overexpression of DHHC20 also caused phenotypic changes consistent with cellular transformation , including colony formation in soft agar , decreased contact inhibition of growth , and increased proliferation under low-serum conditions . Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses of human tissues demonstrated that DHHC20 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner , and is overexpressed in several types of human tumors , including ovarian , breast and prostate . Overall , these results demonstrate that DHHC20 is a human N-terminal-myristoyl-directed PAT involved in cellular transformation , that may play a role in cancer .
Certain hexavalent chromium ( Cr(VI) ) compounds are well established occupational respiratory tract carcinogens . However , despite extensive studies , the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Cr(VI)-induced lung cancer remain poorly understood . In fact , the models used were often suboptimal and yielded conflicting results that were heavily dependent upon the system and experimental conditions employed . Here , we investigated the effects of chronic subcytotoxic and mildly cytotoxic ( 0.1-2 microM ) Cr(VI) exposures on cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells , the main targets of Cr(VI) carcinogenicity . Our studies with the nontumorigenic BEAS-2B cell line suggest that relatively short exposures ( h ) to sublethal Cr(VI) doses ( 0.1-1 microM ) may render these cells less sensitive to contact inhibition . We have also observed a reduced sensitivity to Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis shortly after the beginning of exposure to a mildly cytotoxic Cr(VI) dose ( 2 microM ) . Further studies are needed to determine whether these two phenotypes are involved in the Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenic process . Additionally , evidence gathered in this study strongly points to a Cr(VI) interference with cell adhesion to the substratum and with cell-cell interactions . Finally , by chronically exposing BEAS-2B cells to mildly cytotoxic Cr(VI) doses ( 1 and 2 microM ) , we were able to induce changes in cell morphology and pattern of growth characteristic of an early phase of pre-malignant progression .
To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying altered T cell response in renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) patients , we compared autologous and allogeneic CD8(+) T cell responses against RCC line from RCC patients and their HLA-matched donors , using mixed lymphocyte/tumor cell cultures ( MLTCs ) . In addition , we analyzed the expression of molecules associated with cell cycle regulation . Autologous MLTC responder CD8(+) T cells showed cytotoxic activity against RCC cell lines ; however the analysis of the distribution of CD8(+) T-cell subsets revealed that allogenic counterparts mediate superior antitumor efficacy . In RCC patients , a decreased proliferative response to tumor , associated with defects in JAK3/STAT5/6 expression that led to increased p27KIP1 expression and alterations in the cell cycle , was observed . These data define a molecular pathway involved in cell cycle regulation that is associated with the dysfunction of tumor-specific CD8(+) effector cells . If validated , this may define a therapeutic target in the setting of patients with RCC .
OBJECTIVE To study the effect of Zilongjin ( ZLJ , a composite Chinese drug ) on proliferation and apoptosis of human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 . METHODS MCF-7 cells were randomly divided into four groups depending on the culture solution used , the control group , cultured with 1640 medium not contained ZLJ ; and the three ZJL groups cultured with medium contained low ( 1.5 mg/mL ) , moderate ( 3 mg/mL ) and high ( 6 mg/mL ) dosage of ZLJ crude drug respectively . The changes of cell proliferation were assessed by cell growth curve assay and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT ) assay . And the cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry , Hoechst 33342 staining and DNA ladder assay . RESULTS Compared with that in the normal control , the counts of cells in the three ZLJ groups were decreased significantly ( P<0.05 ) at such time point as 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 , 120 , and 144 h . Furthermore , apart from the comparison of the growth inhibition rate between the low and moderate dosage group at 24 and 72 h which were found to be no significant difference ( P>0.05 ) , the comparison f that among the three ZLJ groups appeared to be significant difference ( P<0.05 ) . The inhibitory effect of ZLJ on cell proliferation of MCF-7 was time- and dose-dependent ; it could retard cells in G0/G1 cell phase ; apoptosis of MCF-7 cell was induced by moderate and high dosage of ZLJ with revealing of apoptotic body and DNA ladder formation . CONCLUSION ZLJ shows cell proliferation inhibitory and apoptosis inducing effects on human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 , and thus to realize its anti-tumor action .
BACKGROUND Paclitaxel and pirarubicin exhibit cytotoxic and antitumor activities . However , little is known about the apoptosis-inducing effects of paclitaxel and pirarubicin on human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells . METHODS The effects of paclitaxel and pirarubicin on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were studied in MG-63 cells using flow cytometry . PCNA , Bcl-2 , Bax , cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression was assessed by Western blotting . RESULTS Paclitaxel and pirarubicin caused G2/M and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in MG-63 cells , respectively . Apoptosis of MG-63 cells mediated by paclitaxel was dependent on treatment duration . Interestingly , in cells treated with pirarubicin , apoptosis was related to treatment duration at concentrations of 10(2)-10(3) nM , whereas the effect of treatment duration was less marked at concentrations >10(4)-10(5) nM . Furthermore , paclitaxel and pirarubicin suppressed the expression of PCNA , cyclin D1 , cyclin E and Bcl-2 , and increased Bax expression . CONCLUSION These results suggest that the G2/M or G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by paclitaxel and pirarubicin are Bcl-2/Bax dependent , suggesting favorable effects of combination therapy with paclitaxel and pirarubicin in the treatment of osteosarcoma .
The tumor suppressor LKB1 is inactivated in 90% of Peutz-Jeghers cancer syndrome , 30-40% of non-small cell lung carcinoma , and a variety of other cancers , indicating the loss of LKB1 activity is a critical step in oncogenesis . However , current understanding of LKB1 function is largely limited to the results from cancer cells , and how LKB1 inactivation initiates malignant transformation in normal cells remains unclear . Here we ablated endogenous expression of LKB1 in two normal cell lines : human embryonic kidney 293T cells ( HEK-293T cells ) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) by LKB1-specific short hairpin RNAs . Downregulation of endogenous LKB1 lead to a facilitated G(1)/S transition , accompanied by a concomitant increase in Rb phosphorylation ( Ser(807/811) ) . Furthermore , reduced expression of p53 and p16 was observed in LKB1 ablated cells , while no differences were detected for cyclin D1 and cyclin E. These results jointly suggest that endogenous LKB1 knockdown accelerates cell cycle progression through G(1)/S checkpoint in HEK-293T cells and HUVECs , which is at least in part , mediated by decline of p53 and p16 pathways . Our findings provided a plausible mechanism by which loss of LKB1 expression in normal cells contributes to the formation of malignancies .
Although contact inhibition is a fundamental process for multicellular organisms , how proliferation is inhibited at high cellular densities remains poorly characterized . Here we show that 4E-BP1 , one major repressor of cap-dependent translation , plays a critical role in density-mediated cell cycle arrest. 4E-BP1 promoter is activated and 4E-BP1 protein amount increases as cells reach confluence . Conversely , a much less marked density-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation is observed upon 4E-BP1 silencing . We further show that at high density , progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle is faster and Cyclin D1 protein is induced in different cell types where 4E-BP1 has been either downregulated ( stable shRNA expression or transient siRNA transfection ) or removed ( knock-out ) . Thus 4E-BP1 appears as an important mediator of contact inhibition .
The development and progression of esophageal cancer is associated with multiple alterations in the genome , including loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from the chromosome 10 ( PTEN ) gene . The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of adenovirus-mediated MMAC/PTEN expression on the growth and survival of human esophageal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo . We found that compared to control cells , overexpression of PTEN significantly suppressed growth and induced apoptosis in esophageal cancer cell lines Eca-109 and TE-1 via downregulation of Bcl-2 expression and changes in cell-cycle progression . Adenovirus PTEN also inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumor xenografts by significantly reducing tumor size in vivo . Thus our results confirm the proposed functional role of MMAC/PTEN as a regulator of esophageal cancer progression in vivo and in vitro . PTEN might be an important biological marker and potential therapeutic target in the treatment of human esophageal cancer .
OBJECTIVE Although downregulation of neural cell adhesion molecule ( NCAM ) has been correlated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , it is also possible that colon cancer spreading comes from reducing tumor cell adhesion through NCAM polysialylation , as occurs in lung carcinoma or Wilms ' tumor . METHODS To prove this hypothesis , we have performed a prospective study on tumor and control specimens from 39 CRC patients , which were immunostained for NCAM and PSA ( polysialic acid ) expression . RESULTS Tumor versus control expression of NCAM and PSA epitopes in tissue specimens , as well as correlation between tumor expression and clinicopathological features , were statistically analyzed . Results showed a low constitutive expression of NCAM and PSA ( PSA-NCAM ) in control tissue , which reached a statistically significant increase in the tumor tissue . Likewise , the presence and number of lymph node metastases at surgery were correlated with NCAM expression and PSA/NCAM coexpression . CONCLUSIONS These data highlight the importance of taking into account PSA-associated epitopes when dealing with NCAM cell expression studies in tumor development and progression . The analysis of PSA and NCAM expression in CRC suggests a new way , other than downregulation of NCAM , in order to escape contact inhibition and promote cell tumor spreading in colorectal cancer .
BACKGROUND/AIMS Adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder is a highly malignant neoplasm. p16 is a tumor suppressor gene protein , which is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that regulates the G1-S phase of the cell cycle . The purpose of the present study was to investigate the expression of p16 in gallbladder carcinoma and its precancerous conditions and to examine the relationship between p16 expression and clinicopathological parameters . METHODOLOGY Formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 20 cases of normal gallbladder , 20 cases of chronic cholecystitis , 20 cases of gallbladder adenoma , 20 cases of dysplasia , and 58 cases of adenocarcinoma were examined . The expression of p16 was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis . RESULTS In normal gallbladder , no expression of p16 was found . In chronic cholecystitis , expression of p16 was not found . In gallbladder adenomas , expression of p16 was found in 20% ( 4/20 ) . In low grade dyspalsias , expression of p16 was not found . In high grade dysplasias , p16 expression was present in 45.0% ( 9/20 ) . In gallbladder adenocarcinomas , p16 expression was found in 27.6% ( 16/58 ) . Expression of p16 correlated significantly with histologic grade ( p < 0.05 ) . No correlation was found between p16 expression and age , gender , tumor size , gross type , location , vascular invasion , lymph node metastasis , and TNM stage , respectively . CONCLUSIONS P16 protein overexpression is an early and relatively common event in carcinogenesis of gallbladder carcinoma . Expression of p16 protein is absent in normal or chronic cholecystitis . Expression of p16 may be an ancillary diagnostic marker of gallbladder carcinoma and its precancerous conditions .
Oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) is the most common malignant tumor in the oral and maxillofacial region . The mechanism of carcinogenesis of OSCC is still unclear . Based on the previous cell line , HIOEC-B(a)P-96 ( HB96 ) , which we obtained by HPV16 E6/E7-immortalized human oral epithelial cells ( HIOEC ) and benzo(a)pyrene inducement , we prepared a new HB-second generation cancer cell line ( HB-2 ) by continuous passage . Its characteristics such as morphology , proliferation activity , karyotype , and tumorigenesis were studied . The HB-2 cells displayed uncontrolled cell division and lost contact inhibition leading to cell overlap . Cells were polygonal and unevenly shaped , with an increased nucleus versus plasma ratio . Increased proliferative activity was confirmed by MTT assays . The tumorigenicity was confirmed by tumor growth experiments in nude mice . Therefore , the HB-2 and HB96 cell lines are useful tools to study the mechanism of carcinogenesis of OSCC in vitro for future genomic and proteomic analyses .
The effect of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) on Vero cell proliferation was investigated , with the attempts to assess the possible hormetic dose-response and to compare their structure-dependent toxicity . Both PCB congeners revealed low doses stimulation in our experiment . However , significant cytotoxicity was only observed in PCB 52 concentrations larger than 0.1 microg ml(-1) , while there was no significant inhibition in PCB 77-treated cells at concentrations selected . Furthermore , the time-dependent cytotoxic trends were different . The comparison between PCB 52 and PCB 77 indicated that the cytotoxic mechanisms involved in coplanar or non-coplanar PCB congener exposure were different , and this difference might be associated with individual genotoxicity and the release of contact inhibition , respectively .
Pam3CSK4 , a synthetic TLR2 ligand , has been shown to expand CD4+ regulatory T cells ( Treg cells ) . Less is known about the function of CD8+ Treg cells than about the function of CD4+ Treg cells generated during allergen-specific immunotherapy ( IT ) . This study investigated whether Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-specific IT could expand the CD8+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg population and whether Pam3CSK4 could enhance the Treg population . PBMCs were isolated from healthy control subjects and from mite-sensitive asthmatic patients during IT at three specific times : before IT and 6 mo and 1 y after the maximum-tolerated dose . This study was performed without a placebo-controlled group . D. pteronyssinus-specific IT induced a significant increase in CD8+Foxp3+ Treg cells expressing intracellular IL-10 and granzyme B. Costimulation of PBMCs with Pam3CSK4 and D. pteronyssinus 2 expanded the CD8+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg population and inhibited D. pteronyssinus 2-induced IL-4 production . Pam3CSK4-treated CD8+CD25+ Treg cells directly suppressed CD4+ T cell proliferation by cell-contact inhibition . TUNEL revealed that CD8+CD25+ Treg cells , but not CD4+CD25+ Treg cells , directly induced CD4+CD45ROhi+ apoptosis . Our results provide direct evidence that Pam3CSK4 induces an immunomodulatory effect by inducing CD8+ Treg cells ; therefore , it may be a good adjuvant for the treatment of mite allergies .
The Ras-assocation domain family ( RASSF ) of tumor suppressor proteins until recently contained six proteins named RASSF1-6 . Recently , four novel family members , RASSF7-10 , have been identified by homology searches for RA-domain-containing proteins . These additional RASSF members are divergent and structurally distinct from RASSF1-6 , containing an N-terminal RA domain and lacking the Sav/RASSF/Hpo ( SARAH ) domain . Here , we show that RASSF8 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the murine embryo and in normal human adult tissues . Functionally , RNAi-mediated knockdown of RASSF8 in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell lines , increased anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and enhanced tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) mice . Furthermore , EdU staining of RASSF8-depleted cells showed growth suppression in a manner dependent on contact inhibition . We show that endogenous RASSF8 is not only found in the nucleus , but is also membrane associated at sites of cell-cell adhesion , co-localizing with the adherens junction ( AJ ) component beta-catenin and binding to E-cadherin . Following RASSF8 depletion in two different lung cancer cell lines using alternative small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) sequences , we show that AJs are destabilized and E-cadherin is lost from the cell membrane . The AJ components beta-catenin and p65 are also lost from sites of cell-cell contact and are relocalized to the nucleus with a concomitant increase in beta-catenin-dependent and nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB)-dependent signaling following RASSF8 depletion . RASSF8 may also be required to maintain actin -cytoskeletal organization since immunofluorescence analysis shows a striking disorganization of the actin- cytoskeleton following RASSF8 depletion . Accordingly , scratch wound healing studies show increased cellular migration in RASSF8-deficient cells . These results implicate RASSF8 as a tumor suppressor gene that is essential for maintaining AJs function in epithelial cells and have a role in epithelial cell migration .
Overexpression/amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER)2/neu ( erbB-2 ) oncogene plays a causal role in carcinogenesis and correlates with a poor clinical prognosis . However , little is known about HER2 in gastric cancer . In this study , we explored the pharmacological activities of natural triterpenoid corosolic acid ( CRA ) in HER2 signaling and its role in gastric cancer development and progression . In this study , CRA dramatically inhibited HER2 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner , effectively inhibited cell proliferation , and induced G(0)/G(1) arrest through the induction of p27(kip1) and cyclin D(1) down-regulation . CRA exposure enhanced apoptotic cell death , as confirmed by caspase-3 and poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase cleavage activities . CRA inhibited signaling pathways downstream of HER2 , including phospho-proteins such as Akt and Erk . In addition , CRA combined with adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil enhanced this growth inhibition , but not with docetaxel and paclitaxel . These findings demonstrate that CRA suppresses HER2 expression , which in turn promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death of gastric cancer cells , providing a rationale for future clinical trials of CRA in the treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancers .
The deregulation of Met/hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) receptor tyrosine kinase signaling constitutes a common event in colorectal cancers . However , the physiopathological functions of such a deregulation remain poorly understood . In the present study , we investigated the role of the deregulation of Met receptor in the neoplastic transformation of intestinal epithelial cells . To do so , the normal , well-established and characterized rat intestinal epithelial IEC-6 cells were transduced with a retrovirus carrying the oncogenic constitutive active form of Met receptor , Tpr-Met . Herein , we show that compared with control IEC-6 cells , Tpr-Met-IEC-6 cells exhibit enhanced proliferation , loss of growth-contact inhibition , cell morphological alterations , actin cytoskeletal reorganization , loss of E-cadherin expression and anchorage-independent growth . Moreover , Tpr-Met-IEC-6 cells are conferred the capacity to produce the proangiogenic factor VEGF and to reduce the potent antiangiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 . Of significance , Tpr-Met-IEC-6 cells are endowed with the ability to elicit angiogenic responses and to form tumors and metastases in vivo . Hence , our study demonstrates for the first time that the sole oncogenic engagement of Met receptor in normal intestinal epithelial cells is sufficient to induce a wide array of cancerous biological processes that are fundamental to the initiation and malignant progression of colorectal cancers .
Contact inhibition is the process by which cells switch from a motile growing state to a passive and stabilized state upon touching their neighbors . When two cells touch , an adhesion link is created between them by means of transmembrane E-cadherin proteins . Simultaneously , their actin filaments stop polymerizing in the direction perpendicular to the membrane and reorganize to create an apical belt that colocalizes with the adhesion links . Here , we propose a detailed quantitative model of the role of cytoplasmic beta-catenin and alpha-catenin proteins in this process , treated as a reaction-diffusion system . Upon cell-cell contact the concentration in alpha-catenin dimers increases , inhibiting actin branching and thereby reducing cellular motility and expansion pressure . This model provides a mechanism for contact inhibition that could explain previously unrelated experimental findings on the role played by E-cadherin , beta-catenin , and alpha-catenin in the cellular phenotype and in tumorigenesis . In particular , we address the effect of a knockout of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene . Potential direct tests of our model are discussed .
Proliferation of non-transformed cells is regulated by cell-cell contacts , which are referred to as contact-inhibition . Vice versa , transformed cells are characterised by a loss of contact-inhibition . Despite its generally accepted importance for cell-cycle control , little is known about the intracellular signalling pathways involved in contact-inhibition . Unravelling the molecular mechanisms of contact-inhibition and its loss during tumourigenesis will be an important step towards the identification of novel target genes in tumour diagnosis and treatment . To better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms we identified the transcriptional programme of contact-inhibition in NIH3T3 fibroblast using high-density microarrays . Setting the cut off : >or=1.5-fold , P <or= 0.05 , 853 genes and 73 cDNA sequences were differentially expressed in confluent compared to exponentially growing cultures . Importing these data into GenMAPP software revealed a comprehensive list of cell-cycle regulatory genes mediating G0/G1 arrest , which was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot . In a narrow analysis ( cut off : >or=2-fold , P <or= 0.002 ) , we found 110 transcripts to be differentially expressed representing 107 genes and 3 cDNA sequences involved , for example , in proliferation , signal transduction , transcriptional regulation , cell adhesion and communication . Interestingly , the majority of genes was upregulated indicating that contact-inhibition is not a passive state , but actively induced . Furthermore , we confirmed differential expression of eight genes by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and identified the potential tumour suppressor transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta)-1-induced clone 22 ( TSC-22 ; tgfb1i4 ) as a novel protein to be induced in contact-inhibited cells .
INTRODUCTION Tamoxifen is the most widely prescribed anti-estrogen treatment for patients with estrogen receptor ( ER)-positive breast cancer . However , there is still a need for biomarkers that reliably predict endocrine sensitivity in breast cancers and these may well be expressed in a dynamic manner . METHODS In this study we assessed gene expression changes at multiple time points ( days 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 14 ) after tamoxifen treatment in the ER-positive ZR-75-1 xenograft model that displays significant changes in apoptosis , proliferation and angiogenesis within 2 days of therapy . RESULTS Hierarchical clustering identified six time-related gene expression patterns , which separated into three groups : two with early/transient responses , two with continuous/late responses and two with variable response patterns . The early/transient response represented reductions in many genes that are involved in cell cycle and proliferation ( e.g . BUB1B , CCNA2 , CDKN3 , MKI67 , UBE2C ) , whereas the continuous/late changed genes represented the more classical estrogen response genes ( e.g . TFF1 , TFF3 , IGFBP5 ) . Genes and the proteins they encode were confirmed to have similar temporal patterns of expression in vitro and in vivo and correlated with reduction in tumour volume in primary breast cancer . The profiles of genes that were most differentially expressed on days 2 , 4 and 7 following treatment were able to predict prognosis , whereas those most changed on days 1 and 14 were not , in four tamoxifen treated datasets representing a total of 404 patients . CONCLUSIONS Both early/transient/proliferation response genes and continuous/late/estrogen-response genes are able to predict prognosis of primary breast tumours in a dynamic manner . Temporal expression of therapy-response genes is clearly an important factor in characterising the response to endocrine therapy in breast tumours which has significant implications for the timing of biopsies in neoadjuvant biomarker studies .
Recent studies have demonstrated that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) are able to suppress cell proliferation and inhibit tumor growth . The objective of our study was to investigate the influence of a high dose EPA on the development of the tumor phenotype in ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( Atm)-deficient mice , a genetic cancer model that is associated with increased levels of oxidative stress . We analyzed toxicity , proliferation , cell-cycle progression , and apoptosis of EPA in vitro and latency to tumorigenesis in vivo . Because of the impact of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) on the tumor incidence in ataxia telangiectasia ( AT ) , we further analyzed the effect of EPA on the generation of ROS and oxidative DNA damage ( ODD ) . EPA effectively inhibited proliferation , altered cell-cycle progression , and induced apoptosis of tumor cells ( AT-4 ) . EPA showed no effect on the latency to tumorigenesis in Atm-deficient mice . EPA treatment was accompanied by a significant increase of ROS and ODD . Our results demonstrate the antiproliferative effect of EPA on tumor cells by alteration of cell-cycle progression and induction of apoptosis in vitro . On the other hand , EPA treatment of Atm-deficient mice led to the formation of ROS and accumulation of ODD that might have abrogated the anticarcinogenic effect caused by EPA .
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) is an endemic malignant disease of the head and neck region with unique features including striking ethnic and geographic variations as well as multifactorial etiology . Previous studies have demonstrated the anticancer properties of genistein , the major soy isoflavonoid , in several human cancer cells such as breast , prostate , colon , gastric , lung , and hepatoma . However , the action of genistein in NPC cells has not been determined . In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effects of genistein on NPC cells and its possible underlying mechanisms . We found that genistein dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of human NPC cell line CNE2 cells . DNA flow cytometric analysis revealed that 30 to 120 microM genistein induced dramatic G2/M phase arrest in NPC cells . The mRNA expression levels , as shown by gene expression array and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction , and the protein expression levels of the cell cycle regulators p21(Cip1) and ATR ( Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related ) were elevated following genistein treatment . Interestingly , we also observed concomitant induction of p15(Ink4b) in genistein induced inhibitory effects in NPC cells . Moreover , selective estrogen receptor modulators did not affect genistein induced growth inhibition . These findings provide new insights into the potential intervention of NPC with genistein .
We have previously demonstrated the antiproliferative effect of two flavonoids-2,2'-dihydroxychalcone ( DHC ) , a novel synthetic flavonoid , and fisetin , a naturally occurring flavonol-in prostate cancer cells . In this study , we further examine the mechanisms of these compounds on survival and proliferation pathways . DHC and fisetin ( 1-50 microM ) caused a dose-dependent reduction in viability , a concomitant increase in apoptosis in PC3 cells at 72 h , and a decrease in clonogenic survival at 24 h treatment . DHC was considerably more potent than fisetin in these cytotoxicity assays . The mechanism of accelerated cellular senescence was not activated by either compound in PC3 or lymph node carcinoma of the prostate ( LNCaP ) cells . Gene expression alterations in PC3 and LNCaP cells treated with 15 muM DHC and 25 microM fisetin for 6 to 24 h were determined by oligonucleotide array . Amongst the most highly represented functional categories of genes altered by both compounds was the cell cycle category . In total , 100 cell cycle genes were altered by DHC and fisetin including 27 genes with key functions in G2/M phase that were downregulated by both compounds . Other functional categories altered included chromosome organization , apoptosis , and stress response . These results demonstrate the multiple mechanisms of antitumor activity of DHC and fisetin in prostate cancer cells in vitro .
AIMS To screen the genes and possible signal transduction pathways with which nucleostemin ( NS ) interacts and explore the mechanism of NS in prostate cancer . METHODS NS-specific short-hairpin RNA expression plasmid was used to downregulate the NS level in PC-3 cells and the changes of cell cycle were studied . After that , oligonucleotide DNA microarray was used to screen the genome changes in PC-3 cells and quantitative real-time PCR was used to further confirm the differentially expressed genes . RESULTS Detection of cell cycle showed a decrease of S stage and an increase of G1 stage after downregulation of NS. 219 differentially expressed genes were found and these genes were involved in cell cycle , cell proliferation , signal transduction , cell apoptosis and cell differentiation , and so on . Genes related to cell cycle were discussed emphatically . INK4 family genes ( P15 , P16 , P18 ) were upregulated while cyclin D1 HDAC1 were downregulated . These genes were tightly related to CDK4/6-cyclin D and pRb-E2F1 complexes . CONCLUSION NS is an important G1/S checkpoint regulator and it could regulate cell cycles via a p53-independent pathway in prostate cancer .
A novel compound 2-arylidene-4,7-dimethyl indan-1-one synthesized was screened for anticancer effect against the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line , MCF-7 . An IC50 value of > or = 80 microM , nontoxic to the normal breast cell line HBL-100 , showed complete inhibition of the MCF-7 cells . Analysis of mechanisms showed nuclear fragmentation and DNA laddering in gel electrophoresis . GSH and GR levels were found to be reduced after the compound treatment . Cell cycle analysis using fluorescent cytometry revealed G2/M phase arrest , which indicates the compound deserves consideration for further studies against cancer .
INTRODUCTION The homeobox-containing transcription factor muscle segment homeobox 2 ( Msx2 ) plays an important role in mammary gland development . However , the clinical implications of Msx2 expression in breast cancer are unclear . The aims of this study were to investigate the potential clinical value of Msx2 as a breast cancer biomarker and to clarify its functional role in vitro . METHODS Msx2 gene expression was first examined in a well-validated breast cancer transcriptomic dataset of 295 patients . Msx2 protein expression was then evaluated by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray ( TMA ) containing 281 invasive breast tumours . Finally , to assess the functional role of Msx2 in vitro , Msx2 was ectopically expressed in a highly invasive breast tumour cell line ( MDA-MB-231 ) and an immortalised breast cell line ( MCF10a ) , and these cell lines were examined for changes in growth rate , cell death and cell signalling . RESULTS Examination of Msx2 mRNA expression in a breast cancer transcriptomic dataset demonstrated that increased levels of Msx2 were associated with good prognosis ( P = 0.011 ) . Evaluation of Msx2 protein expression on a TMA revealed that Msx2 was detectable in both tumour cell nuclei and cytoplasm . Cytoplasmic Msx2 expression was associated with low grade tumours ( P = 0.012 ) and Ki67 negativity ( P = 0.018 ) . Nuclear Msx2 correlated with low-grade tumours ( P = 0.015 ) , estrogen receptor positivity ( P = 0.038 ) , low Ki67 ( P = 0.005 ) and high cyclin D1 expression ( P = 0.037 ) . Increased cytoplasmic Msx2 expression was associated with a prolonged breast cancer-specific survival ( P = 0.049 ) , recurrence-free survival ( P = 0.029 ) and overall survival ( P = 0.019 ) . Ectopic expression of Msx2 in breast cell lines resulted in radically decreased cell viability mediated by induction of cell death via apoptosis . Further analysis of Msx2-expressing cells revealed increased levels of p21 and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) and decreased levels of Survivin and the ' split ends ' ( SPEN ) protein family member RBM15 . CONCLUSIONS We conclude that increased Msx2 expression results in improved outcome for breast cancer patients , possibly by increasing the likelihood of tumour cell death by apoptosis .
The expression of " growth arrest and DNA damage inducible genes 45 and 153 " is related to apoptotic induction of cells . GADD45 is an effector gene of the tumor suppressor p53 , and GADD153 is associated with cellular function of cancer prevention . Curcumin , isolated from the plant Curcuma longa ( LINN ) , has been investigated as a promising cancer preventive in food because curcumin , a phenolic and coloring compound , is widely ingested in the Indian subcontinent . However , the exact mechanisms of action of curcumin have not yet been clearly elucidated . Based on our successful results with green tea catechins as cancer preventive , we studied the relationship between the expression of GADD45 and 153 and apoptotic induction in human lung cancer cell line PC-9 . In our study curcumin increased the expression of GADD45 and 153 in a p53-independent manner . Curcumin also inhibited the growth of PC-9 cells and induced G(1)/S arrest of the cell-cycle followed by strong induction of apoptosis . Treatment with GADD45 and 153 small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) inhibited the apoptotic induction in PC-9 cells by curcumin . Moreover , curcumin induced the expression of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor genes p21 and p27 , while it inhibited the expression of numerous genes , including Bcl-2 , cyclin D1 , CDK2 , CDK4 and CDK6 . All the results with PC-9 cells suggest that the up-regulation of GADD45 and 153 by curcumin is a prime mechanism in the anticancer activity of curcumin .
Genipin is a metabolite of geniposide isolated from an extract of Gardenia fructus . Some observations suggested that genipin could induce cell apoptosis in hepatoma cells and PC3 human prostate cancer cells . However , the effects of genipin on HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells are still unknown . In this study , we provided evidences that genipin induced the death of HeLa cells through apoptotic pathway in a dose-dependent manner . Genipin could remarkably induce cytotoxicity in HeLa cells and inhibit its proliferation . Induction of the apoptosis by genipin was confirmed by analysis of DNA fragmentation and induction of sub-G(1) peak through flow cytometry . The results also showed that genipin-treated HeLa cells cycle was arrested at G(1) phase . Western blot analysis revealed that the phosphorylated c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase ( JNK ) protein , phospho-Jun protein , p53 protein and bax protein significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner after treatment of genipin for 24 h , and to our knowledge , the activation of JNK maybe result in the increase of the p53 protein level , and the increase of the p53 protein led to the accumulation of bax protein , bax protein further induced cell apoptotic death eventually . Taken all these together , it is possible to develop genipin as an anti-cancer drug .
BACKGROUND The most deadly form of cancer is not lung or colon , breast or prostate ; it is any cancer that has become metastatic . Mortality due to metastatic melanoma , one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers , has increased steadily over the last several decades . Unfortunately , the arsenal of chemotherapeutic agents available today is most often unsuccessful at extending and improving the life expectancy of afflicted individuals . We sought to identify an effective and nontoxic agent against metastatic melanoma . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We chose to study Cloudman S-91 mouse melanoma cells ( sub-clone M3 , CCL53.1 ) because these cells are highly aggressive and metastatic , representing one of the deadliest types of cancer . Melanoma cells also had an experimental advantage because their morphology , which is easily monitored , relates to the physiology of metastatic cells and normal melanocytes . We chose to test methyl sulfone as a chemotherapeutic agent for two reasons . Because of its chemical structure , we speculated a potential anti-cancer activity by targeting microtubules . Equally important , methyl sulfone has a well-established safety profile in humans . Surprisingly , we found that malignant melanoma cells exposed to methyl sulfone demonstrated the loss of phenotypes characteristic of malignant cells , and the reemergence of phenotypes characteristic of healthy melanocytes . Briefly , over time methyl sulfone induced contact inhibition , loss of ability to migrate through an extracellular matrix , loss of anchorage-independent growth , proper wound healing followed by contact inhibition , irreversible senescence followed by arborization with melanosomes in arbors as seen in normal melanocytes . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Methyl sulfone may have clinical potential as a non-toxic agent effective against metastatic melanoma . Additionally , methyl sulfone has promise as a tool to explore molecular mechanisms of metastatic transformation as well as fundamental processes such as cell migration , contact inhibition , wound healing and cellular senescence .
INTRODUCTION IkappaB Kinase epsilon ( IKKepsilon ) is a member of the IKK family which plays an important role in the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) . Overexpressed in over 30% of breast cancers , IKKepsilon has been recently identified as a potential breast cancer oncogene . The purpose of this study is to examine the therapeutic potential of IKKepsilon siRNA on human breast cancer cells . METHODS Eight siRNAs targeting different regions of the IKKepsilon mRNA were designed , and the silencing effect was screened by quantitative real time RT-PCR . The biological effects of synthetic siRNAs on human breast cancer cells were investigated by examining the cell proliferation , migration , invasion , focus formation , anchorage-independent growth(via soft agar assay ) , cell cycle arrest , apoptosis ( via annexing binding ) , NF-kappaB basal level , and NF-kappaB related gene expressions upon the IKKepsilon silencing . RESULTS Silencing of IKKepsilon in human breast cancer cells resulted in decrease of focus formation potential and clonogenicity as well as in vitro cell migration/invasion capabilities . Moreover , knockdown of IKKepsilon suppressed cell proliferation . Cell cycle assay showed that the anti-proliferation effect of IKKepsilon siRNA was mediated by arresting cells in G(0)/G(1) phase , which was caused by down-regulation of cyclin D(1) . Furthermore , we demonstrated that silencing of IKKepsilon inhibited the NF-kappaB basal activity as well as the Bcl-2 expression . Significant apoptosis was not observed in breast cancer cells upon the silencing of IKKepsilon . The present study provided the first evidence that silencing IKKepsilon using synthetic siRNA could inhibit the invasiveness properties and proliferation of breast cancer cells . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggested that silencing IKKepsilon using synthetic siRNA may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for breast cancer .
BACKGROUND Human Barrett's cancer cell lines have numerous , poorly-characterized genetic abnormalities and , consequently , those lines have limited utility as models for studying the early molecular events in carcinogenesis . Cell lines with well-defined genetic lesions that recapitulate various stages of neoplastic progression in Barrett's esophagus would be most useful for such studies . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS To develop such model cell lines , we started with telomerase-immortalized , non-neoplastic Barrett's epithelial ( BAR-T ) cells , which are spontaneously deficient in p16 , and proceeded to knock down p53 using RNAi , to activate Ras by introducing oncogenic H-Ras(G12V) , or both . BAR-T cells infected with either p53 RNAi or oncogenic H-Ras(G12V) alone maintained cell-to-cell contact inhibition and did not exhibit anchorage-independent growth in soft agar . In contrast , the combination of p53 RNAi knockdown with expression of oncogenic H-Ras(G12V) transformed the p16-deficient BAR-T cells , as evidenced by their loss of contact inhibition , by their formation of colonies in soft agar , and by their generation of tumors in immunodeficient mice . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Through these experiments , we have generated a number of transformed and non-transformed cell lines with well-characterized genetic abnormalities recapitulating various stages of carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus . These lines should be useful models for the study of carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus , and for testing the efficacy of chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents .
Histone deacetylase inhibitors induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells and are , therefore , promising anti-cancer drugs . The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is activated in histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor-treated tumor cells , and its growth-inhibitory function contributes to the anti-tumorigenic effect of HDAC inhibitors . We show here that induction of p21 by trichostatin A involves MAP kinase signaling . Activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway by growth factors or stress signals results in histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation at the p21 promoter and is crucial for acetylation of the neighboring lysine 14 and recruitment of activated RNA polymerase II in response to trichostatin A treatment . In non-induced cells , the protein phosphatase PP2A is associated with the p21 gene and counteracts its activation . Induction of p21 is linked to simultaneous acetylation and phosphorylation of histone H3 . The dual modification mark H3S10phK14ac at the activated p21 promoter is recognized by the phospho-binding protein 14-3-3zeta , which protects the phosphoacetylation mark from being processed by PP2A . Taken together we have revealed a cross-talk of reversible phosphorylation and acetylation signals that controls the activation of p21 by HDAC inhibitors and identify the phosphatase PP2A as chromatin-associated transcriptional repressor in mammalian cells .
BACKGROUND/AIMS We investigated whether the anticancer drug Ukrain ( UK ) is able to modulate the expression of some of the key markers of tumor progression in pancreatic cell carcinoma , in order to assess its potential therapeutic effect . METHODS Three cell lines ( HPAF-II , PL45 , HPAC ) were treated with UK ( 5 , 10 and 20 muM ) for 48 h , or left untreated . Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine ( SPARC ) mRNA levels were assessed by real-time PCR . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP)-2 and -9 activity was analyzed by SDS zymography ; SPARC protein levels in cell lysates and supernatants were determined by Western blot . Cell cycle was determined by flow cytometric analysis , and invasion by matrigel invasion assay . RESULTS UK down-regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 , suggesting that UK may decrease pancreatic cancer cell invasion , as confirmed by the matrigel invasion assay . SPARC protein down-regulation in supernatants points to an inhibition by UK of extracellular matrix remodeling in the tumor microenvironment . At the same time , SPARC mRNA and cellular protein level up-regulation suggests that UK can affect cell proliferation by cell cycle inhibition , showing a cell cycle G2/M arrest in UK-treated cells . CONCLUSION Our results suggest that UK modulates two major aspects involved in tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer cells , such as extracellular matrix remodeling and cell proliferation .
BACKGROUND Apoptosis , a widely important mechanism that contributes to cell growth reduction , is reported to be induced by Crocus sativus in different cancer types . The present study was designed to elucidate apoptosis induction by crocin , a main component of Crocus sativus in a human pancreatic cancer cell line ( BxPC-3 ) . METHODS Cell viability was measured by MTT assay , Hoechest33258 staining was used to detect the chromatin condensation characteristic of apoptosis , and DNA fragmentation was assessed by gel electrophoresis and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry . RESULTS Crocin induced apoptosis and G1-phase cell cycle arrest of BxPC-3 cells , while decreasing cell viability in a dose dependent and time dependent manner . Cells treated with 10mug/L crocin exhibited apoptotic morphology ( brightly blue-fluorescent condensed nuclei on Hoechst 33258 staining ) and reduction of volume . DNA analysis revealed typical ladders as early as 12 hours after treatment indicative of apoptosis . CONCLUSION Our preclinical study demonstrated a pancreatic cancer cell line to be highly sensitive to crocin-mediated growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death . Although the molecular mechanisms of crocin action are not yet clearly understood , it appears to have potential as a therapeutic agent .
Several studies have indicated that the cell-surface expressed nucleolin is implicated in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis , and represents an important target for cancer therapy . Here we show that treatment of rhabdoid tumor derived G401 cells with a nucleolin antagonist , the HB-19 pseudopeptide , could restore contact inhibition , impair anchorage-independent growth , and suppress tumor development in nude mice . G401 cells grow without contact inhibition , which is an in vitro characteristic property of malignant tumor cells . At concentrations of HB-19 that does not affect cell viability and multiplication index , there is restoration of contact inhibition thus suggesting that HB-19 treatment causes reversion of the malignant phenotype . Accordingly , HB-19 pretreated G401 cells lose the capacity to form colonies in soft agar . When assayed for tumorigenicity in nude mice , only 50% of mice injected with HB-19 pretreated G401 cells developed tumors with the mean tumor weight of 0.32 g , compared to 100% of mice injected with control G401 cells with the mean tumor weight of 2.36 g . Interestingly , the restoration of contact inhibition in HB-19 treated G401 cells is concomitant with marked reduction of transcripts coding the Wilms ' tumor 1 gene , matrix metalloproteinase-2 , epithelial isoform of CD44 , and vascular endothelial growth factor , whereas no apparent modification is detected for transcripts coding the proto-oncogene c-Myc , anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 , pro-apoptotic Bax , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP-1 , angiogenesis inhibitor TSP-1 , and growth factor Midkine . These findings indicate that the molecular mechanism of action of HB-19 on such highly malignant rhabdoid tumor cells is associated with a selective inhibitory effect on the expression of genes implicated in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis .
Many cells in mammals exist in the state of quiescence , which is characterized by reversible exit from the cell cycle . Quiescent cells are widely reported to exhibit reduced size , nucleotide synthesis , and metabolic activity . Much lower glycolytic rates have been reported in quiescent compared with proliferating lymphocytes . In contrast , we show here that primary human fibroblasts continue to exhibit high metabolic rates when induced into quiescence via contact inhibition . By monitoring isotope labeling through metabolic pathways and quantitatively identifying fluxes from the data , we show that contact-inhibited fibroblasts utilize glucose in all branches of central carbon metabolism at rates similar to those of proliferating cells , with greater overflow flux from the pentose phosphate pathway back to glycolysis . Inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway resulted in apoptosis preferentially in quiescent fibroblasts . By feeding the cells labeled glutamine , we also detected a " backwards " flux in the tricarboxylic acid cycle from alpha-ketoglutarate to citrate that was enhanced in contact-inhibited fibroblasts ; this flux likely contributes to shuttling of NADPH from the mitochondrion to cytosol for redox defense or fatty acid synthesis . The high metabolic activity of the fibroblasts was directed in part toward breakdown and resynthesis of protein and lipid , and in part toward excretion of extracellular matrix proteins . Thus , reduced metabolic activity is not a hallmark of the quiescent state . Quiescent fibroblasts , relieved of the biosynthetic requirements associated with generating progeny , direct their metabolic activity to preservation of self integrity and alternative functions beneficial to the organism as a whole .
Although the p16(INK4a) and p21Waf1/Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitors are known to play key roles in cellular senescence in vitro , their roles in senescence remain rather poorly understood in vivo . This situation is partly due to the possibility of compensatory effect(s) between p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 or to the upregulation of functionally related CDK inhibitors . To directly address the cooperative roles of p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in senescence in vivo , we generated a mouse line simply lacking both p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 genes [ double-knockout ( DKO) ] . Mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEF ) derived from DKO mice displayed no evidence of cellular senescence when cultured serially in vitro . Moreover , DKO MEFs readily escaped Ras-induced senescence and overrode contact inhibition in culture . This was not the case in MEFs lacking either p16INK4a or p21Waf1/Cip1 , indicating that p16(INK4a) and p21Waf1/Cip1 play cooperative roles in cellular senescence and contact inhibition in vitro . Notably , we found the DKO mice to be extremely susceptible to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced skin carcinogenesis that involves oncogenic mutation of the H-ras gene . Mechanistic investigations suggested that the high incidence of cancer in DKO mice likely reflected a cooperative effect of increased benign skin tumor formation caused by p21Waf1/Cip1 loss , with increased malignant conversion of benign skin tumors caused by p16(INK4a) loss . Our findings establish an intrinsic cooperation between p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in the onset of cellular senescence and tumor suppression in vivo .
Periplocin is one of cardenolides isolated from cortex periplocae which is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and reinforcement of bones and tendons in traditional medicine . Here , we investigated the anti-tumor activity of periplocin against lung cancer cells bothin vitro and in vivo , and explored its anti-cancer mechanism . Periplocin inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells and induced their apoptosis in time- and dose-dependent manners by cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase . Periplocin exhibited anti-tumor activity both in human ( A549 ) and mouse ( LL/2 ) lung cancer xenograft models . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that intratumoral angiogenesis was significantly suppressed . Furthermore , anti-cancer activity mediated by periplocin was associated with decreased level of phosphorylated AKT and ERK both in vitro and in vivo , which were important for cell growth and survival . Moreover , periplocin induced apoptosis by downregulating Bcl-2 and upregulating Bax , leading to activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 . These findings suggested that periplocin could inhibit the growth of lung cancer both in vitro and in vivo , which could be attributed to the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis signaling pathway , such as AKT and ERK . These observations provide further evidence on the anti-tumor effect of periplocin , and it may be of importance to further explore its potential role as a therapeutic agent for cancer .
The incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) is increasing but the long-term survival rate remains low . An animal model would therefore be helpful for evaluation of new treatment modalities for oral SCC . Hamster is small animal , therefore , the cancer of hamster cheek pouch is not optimal for tumor imaging . The VX2 cell line has been used in many carcinoma-related studies , including oral SCC research , but it is derived from cutaneous tissue and not mucosa . We chemically induced tongue squamous cell carcinoma in rabbits and subsequently established a rabbit squamous cell line . The cells grew in multiple layers without contact inhibition for 60 passages over 2 years and were positive for cytokeratin ( CK ) . Electron microscopy revealed that cells were polygonal with rich microvilli on the surface , and there were desmosomes between cells and bundles of tonofibril beside the cell membrane . The chromosome number ranged from 71 to 272 , with a modal value of 145 ( 12.4% ) . The cells were transplantable into nude mice subcutaneously or rabbit submucosally and produced carcinomas in all the animals . The cell line should be a useful tool for the study of the biological characteristics of oral SCC , especially tongue SCC .
Metastatic cancer cells typically fail to halt migration on contact with non-cancer cells . This invasiveness is in contrast to normal mesenchymal cells that retract on contact with another cell . Why cancer cells are defective in contact inhibition of locomotion is not understood . Here , we analyse the dynamics of prostate cancer cell lines co-cultured with fibroblasts , and demonstrate that a combinatorial code of Eph receptor activation dictates whether cell migration will be contact inhibited . The unimpeded migration of metastatic PC-3 cells towards fibroblasts is dependent on activation of EphB3 and EphB4 by ephrin-B2 , which we show activates Cdc42 and cell migration . Knockdown of EphB3 and EphB4 restores contact inhibition of locomotion to PC-3 cells . Conversely , homotypic collisions between two cancer cells results in contact inhibition of locomotion , mediated by EphA-Rho-Rho kinase ( ROCK ) signalling . Thus , the migration of cancer cells can switch from restrained to invasive , depending on the Eph-receptor profile of the cancer cell and the reciprocal ephrin ligands expressed by neighbouring cells .
An epithelial cell line , referred to as A163 , was established from breast carcinoma derived from a patient with a strong family history of breast cancer but no known breast cancer susceptibility mutation . A163 was propagated in a serum-free culture medium including the epidermal growth factor . Immunophenotypic characterization demonstrated a mixed luminal and basal-like phenotype . When epidermal growth factor was excluded from the culture medium , A163 entered a quiescent period followed by a period of increased cell proliferation in a subpopulation of the cells . The epidermal growth factor-independent subpopulation retained the basal-like phenotype of the parental cell line . Karyotype and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis showed an amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor on 7q in A163-S1 only , resulting in high expression of total and phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor . The A163-S1 sub-line piles up in culture , indicating a loss of contact inhibition . When grown on transwell filters , A163 shows basal expression of P63 and cytokeratin 14 , whereas A163-S1 expresses P63 ubiquitously , and has lost the basal specific expression of cytokeratin 14 , indicating a loss of polarity . Furthermore , when cultured in reconstituted basement membrane matrix , A163 form polarized normal like acini . In contrast , A163-S1 form large disorganized structures with lack of polarity . These cell lines may prove useful to understand molecular changes in breast cancer progression , in particular basal-like breast cancer subtype with bad prognosis and no current treatment options .
Osteoblastic bone metastases are the most common metastases produced by human prostate cancers ( PCa ) . Deregulated activity of Wnt growth factors resulting from overexpression of the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 ( DKK-1 ) is known to contribute to formation of the osteoblastic component of PCa skeletal bone metastases . In this study , we report that DKK-1 knockdown in osteolytic human PCa cells unexpectedly delays the development of both soft tissue and osseous lesions . PCa cells deficient in DKK-1 expression did not increase canonical Wnt signaling in target osteoblast cell lines ; however , DKK-1 knockdown PCa cells exhibited increased expression of the CDK inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1) and a 32% increase in G(1) arrest compared with control cells . Ablating p21(CIP1/WAF1) in PCa cells deficient in DKK-1 was sufficient to rescue tumor growth . Collectively , our findings demonstrate that DKK-1 overexpression supports tumor growth in part by restricting expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1) through a mechanism independent of canonical Wnt signaling .
Deregulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) is closely associated with malignant transformation and tumor cell survival in various cancers . We found that IGF-1R expression level in leukemia cells positively correlated with the percentage of blast in bone marrow from de novo acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patients . Moreover , we showed that NVP-ADW742 , a novel small weight molecular inhibitor of IGF-IR , could induce apoptosis in both HL-60 cell line and primary AML blasts . However , no significant alteration of cell cycle was observed in HL-60 cells . Further studies revealed that NVP-ADW742 induced Akt dephosphorylation , which might subsequently induce p38 phosphorylation and decrease antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression in HL-60 cells . Finally , we demonstrated that NVP-ADW742 could synergize with Ara-C to induce the kill in a subset of drug-resistant AML specimens . We suggested that IGF-lR targeting might be therapeutically beneficial for some AML patients .
SWAP-70 , a phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate ( PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) ) binding protein , has been suggested to be involved in transformation of mouse embryo fibroblasts ( MEFs ) as well as membrane ruffling after growth factor stimulation of the cells . A mutant , SWAP-70-374 , was found to be able to bind to F-actin in vitro , whereas wild-type SWAP-70 failed to do so . This mutant was present at the plasma membrane without any stimulation while the wild-type protein was present only in the cytosol unless cells were stimulated with EGF . Expression of this mutant in MEFs resulted in morphologic transformation , fast growth , and loss of contact inhibition , suggesting that SWAP-70 with this mutation can transform the cells . ERK1/2 was activated in SWAP-70-374-transformed cells . Use of MEK inhibitors revealed that the ERK1/2 pathway does not affect the cell growth of MEFs but is responsible for loss of contact inhibition . To investigate the function of SWAP-70 further , drugs that can inhibit SWAP-70-dependent cell responses were screened . Among various drugs , sanguinarine was found to inhibit transformation of MEFs by SWAP-70-374 . This drug was able to inhibit SWAP-70-mediated membrane ruffling as well , suggesting that its effect was closely related to the SWAP-70 signaling pathway . These results suggest that SWAP-70-374 can activate some signaling pathways , including the ERK1/2 pathway , to transform MEFs .
The polycomb group family protein BMI-1 is overexpressed by and functions as an oncogene in many different human cancers . We have previously shown that BMI-1 promotes the tumorigenicity of Ewing sarcoma family tumors ( ESFTs ) and that this is mediated independently of CDKN2A repression . In this study , we have discovered that high levels of BMI-1 confer resistance to contact inhibition in ESFT cells . Using stable retroviral transduction , we evaluated the consequences of BMI-1 knockdown on the growth of CDKN2A wild-type and mutant ESFT cells in subconfluent and confluent conditions . Although knockdown of BMI-1 had no effect on proliferation in low-density cultures , at high cell densities it resulted in cell cycle arrest and death . The normal cell contact inhibition response is mediated , in large part , by the recently described Hippo pathway which functions to inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell death by inactivating the Yes-Associated Protein ( YAP ) . Significantly , we found that YAP levels , activity and expression did not diminish in confluent ESFT cells that expressed high levels of BMI-1 . In contrast , YAP expression and nuclear localization were reduced in confluent BMI-1 knockdown cells suggesting that silencing of BMI-1 restored contact inhibition by restoring normal activation of the Hippo-YAP growth-suppressor pathway . Importantly , knockdown of YAP in ESFT cells resulted in profound inhibition of cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation suggesting that stabilization and continued expression of YAP is critical for ESFT growth and tumorigenicity . Together , these studies reveal a previously unrecognized link between BMI-1 , contact inhibition and the Hippo-YAP pathway and suggest that resistance to contact inhibition in BMI-1 overexpressing cancer cells may be in part a result of Hippo inhibition and aberrant stabilization of YAP .
Dentin matrix protein 1 ( DMP1 ) is a member of the small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein ( SIBLING ) family , a group of proteins initially described as mineralized extracellular matrices components . More recently , SIBLINGs have been implicated in several key steps of cancer progression , including angiogenesis . Although proangiogenic activities have been demonstrated for 2 SIBLINGs , the role of DMP1 in angiogenesis has not yet been addressed . We demonstrate that this extracellular matrix protein induced the expression of vascular endothelial cadherin ( VE-cadherin ) , a key regulator of intercellular junctions and contact inhibition of growth of endothelial cells that is also known to modulate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR-2 ) activity , the major high-affinity receptor for VEGF . DMP1 induced VE-cadherin and p27(Kip1) expression followed by cell-cycle arrest in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) in a CD44-dependent manner . VEGF-induced proliferation , migration , and tubulogenesis responses were specifically blocked on DMP1 pretreatment of HUVECs . Indeed , after VE-cadherin induction , DMP1 inhibited VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and Src-mediated signaling . However , DMP1 did not interfere with basic fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis . In vivo , DMP1 significantly reduced laser-induced choroidal neovascularization lesions and tumor-associated angiogenesis . These data enable us to put DMP1 on the angiogenic chessboard for the first time and to identify this protein as a new specific inhibitor of VEGF-induced angiogenesis .
Modeling the behavior of mammalian arachnoid cells is critical to understand hydrocephalus and other brain disorders involving abnormal flow of cerebrospinal fluid , yet relatively little is known about the physiology of arachnoid cells due to lack of a robust three-dimensional model system . Explanted primary cultures have been the only option to study transport across arachnoid cell membranes , but practical limitations of primary culture include slow growth , early senescence , and poor reproducibility . The purpose of this study was to create immortalized rat arachnoid cell lines to permit in vitro study of arachnoid granulations and properties of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) flow . We established and partially characterized two immortalized cell lines generated from primary rat arachnoid cells , using retroviral gene transfer of SV40 large T antigen ( SV40 LTAg ) either with or without human telomerase ( hTERT ) . The established cell lines stably express either SV40 LTAg alone , or SV40 LTAg and hTERT , and demonstrate high proliferative rate , contact inhibition at confluence , and stable expression of protein markers characteristic of native arachnoid cells over more than 160 passages .
Chemoprevention is one feasible approach to decreasing morbidity and mortality of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The present study aimed to explore the mechanisms of chemoprevention of NSCLC by Prunella vulgaris L . ( PV ) using a PV extract of 60% ethanol ( P-60 ) . In an A/J mouse model benzo[a]pyrene induction of lung tumors was significantly reduced difference by P-60 group . In addition , P-60 was found to have the ability to regulate cell cycle and induce apoptosis in SPC-A-1 cells . Therefore , we propose that P-60 has potential as a lung cancer chemopreventive agent .
BACKGROUND Nucleolin is one of the major proteins of the nucleolus , but it is also expressed on the cell surface where is serves as a binding protein for variety of ligands implicated in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis . Emerging evidence suggests that the cell-surface expressed nucleolin is a strategic target for an effective and nontoxic cancer therapy . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS By monitoring the expression of nucleolin mRNA , and by measuring the level of nucleolin protein recovered from the surface and nucleus of cells , here we show that the presence of nucleolin at the cell surface is dependent on the constant induction of nucleolin mRNA . Indeed , inhibitors of RNA transcription or translation block expression of surface nucleolin while no apparent effect is observed on the level of nucleolin in the nucleus . The estimated half-life of surface nucleolin is less than one hour , whereas that of nuclear nucleolin is more than 8 hours . Nucleolin mRNA induction is reduced markedly in normal fibroblasts that reach confluence , while it occurs continuously even in post-confluent epithelial tumor cells consistent with their capacity to proliferate without contact inhibition . Interestingly , cold and heat shock induce nucleolin mRNA concomitantly to enhanced mRNA expression of the heat shock protein 70 , thus suggesting that surface nucleolin induction also occurs in response to an environmental insult . At the cell surface , one of the main functions of nucleolin is to shuttle specific extracellular ligands by an active transport mechanism , which we show here to be calcium dependent . CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE Our results demonstrate that the expression of surface nucleolin is an early metabolic event coupled with tumor cell proliferation and stress response . The fact that surface nucleolin is constantly and abundantly expressed on the surface of tumor cells , makes them a preferential target for the inhibitory action of anticancer agents that target surface nucleolin .
BACKGROUND/AIMS Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) have been implicated in antitumor therapy for hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tumors . Cell-contact and soluble factors are demonstrated to play a role in the growth inhibition of tumor cells mediated by MSCs in vitro , while there is little clue about signaling pathways involved in the process . P38 MAPK has been implicated as a suppressor of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis . We here investigate whether p38 MAPK is involved in MSC-induced growth inhibition of leukemic tumor cells . Methods : We characterized the effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells ( UC-MSCs ) on proliferation , cell cycle and phosphorylation pattern of p38 MAPK in HL60 and K562 cells . SB203580 , a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK , or p38 MAPK-small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , were used to identify the role of p38 in growth suppression by UC-MSCs . We also investigated the expression of cell cycle regulators . RESULTS Treatment with UC-MSCs led to potent proliferation-inhibition of HL60 and K562 cells without inducing apoptosis . Growth inhibition by UC-MSCs was due to G0/G1 arrest . UC-MSCs increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in HL60 and K562 cells . Pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing ( through siRNA ) of p38 MAPK partially abrogated the proliferation-suppression and cell cycle arrest caused by UC-MSCs . UC-MSCs also modulated the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in HL60 and K562 cells while SB203580 reversed the effect . CONCLUSION Taken together , our findings indicate that p38 MAPK is critical for the growth inhibitory effect of UC-MSCs on leukemic tumor cells .
Radiotherapy for head and neck tumors often results in persistent loss of function in salivary glands . Patients suffering from impaired salivary function frequently terminate treatment prematurely because of reduced quality of life caused by malnutrition and other debilitating side-effects . It has been previously shown in mice expressing a constitutively active form of Akt ( myr-Akt1 ) , or in mice pretreated with IGF1 , apoptosis is suppressed , which correlates with maintained salivary gland function measured by stimulated salivary flow . Induction of cell cycle arrest may be important for this protection by allowing cells time for DNA repair . We have observed increased accumulation of cells in G2/M at acute time-points after irradiation in parotid glands of mice receiving pretreatment with IGF1 . As p21 , a transcriptional target of the p53 family , is necessary for maintaining G2/M arrest , we analyzed the roles of p53 and p63 in modulating IGF1-stimulated p21 expression . Pretreatment with IGF1 reduces binding of DeltaNp63 to the p21 promoter after irradiation , which coincides with increased p53 binding and sustained p21 transcription . Our data indicate a role for DeltaNp63 in modulating p53-dependent gene expression and influencing whether a cell death or cell cycle arrest program is initiated .
Transcriptional coactivator amplified in breast cancer 1 ( AIB1 ) plays important roles in the progression of several cancers such as prostate cancer , breast cancer , and hepatocellular carcinoma . However , its role in cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) , a chemoresistant bile duct carcinoma with a poor prognosis , remains unclear . In this study we found that AIB1 protein was frequently overexpressed in human CCA specimens and CCA cell lines . Down-regulation of AIB1 induced the G2/M arrest and decreased the expression of mitosis-promoting factors including Cyclin A , Cyclin B , and Cdk1 through suppressing the Akt pathway , which resulted in inhibiting CCA cell proliferation . In addition , AIB1 enhanced the chemoresistance of CCA cells at least in part through up-regulating the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 . AIB1 regulated the expression of Bcl-2 in CCA cells through activating the Akt pathway as well as suppressing intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . AIB1 suppressed ROS by up-regulating antioxidants such as glutathione synthetase and glutathione peroxidase , which are targets of the NF-E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) , a critical transcription factor that regulates antioxidants , detoxification enzymes , and drug efflux proteins . AIB1 also increased the expression of another two Nrf2 targets , ABCC2 and ABCG2 , to enhance drug efflux . AIB1 served as an essential coactivator for Nrf2 activation by physically interacting with Nrf2 to enhance its transcriptional activity . Conclusion : AIB1 plays an important role in proliferation and chemoresistance of CCA through simultaneous activation of Akt and Nrf2 pathways , suggesting that AIB1 is a potential molecular target for CCA treatment .
BACKGROUND Neuroblastoma ( NBL ) is a common pediatric solid tumor , and outcomes for patients with advanced neuroblastoma remain poor despite extremely aggressive treatment . Chemotherapy resistance at relapse contributes heavily to treatment failure . The poor survival of patients with high-risk NBL prompted this investigation into novel treatment options with the objective of gaining a better understanding of resistance mechanisms . On the basis of previous work and on data from publicly available studies , the authors hypothesized that human epidermal growth factor receptor 4 ( Her4 ) contributes to resistance . METHODS Her4 expression was reduced with small-hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) to over express intracellular HER4 , and the authors tested its impact on tumor cell survival under various culture conditions . The resulting changes in gene expression after HER4 knockdown were measured by using a messenger RNA ( mRNA ) array . RESULTS HER4 expression was up-regulated in tumor spheres compared with the expression in monolayer culture . With HER4 knockdown , NBL cells became less resistant to anoikis and serum starvation . Moreover , HER4 knockdown increased the chemosensitivity of NBL cells to cisplatin , doxorubicin , etoposide , and activated ifosfamide . In mRNA array analysis , HER4 knockdown predominately altered genes related to cell cycle regulation . In NBL spheres compared with monolayers , cell proliferation was decreased , and cyclin D expression was reduced . HER4 knockdown reversed cyclin D suppression . Overexpressed intracellular HER4 slowed the cell cycle and induced chemoresistance . CONCLUSIONS The current results indicated that HER4 protects NBL cells from multiple exogenous apoptotic stimuli , including anoikis , nutrient deficiency , and cytotoxic chemotherapy . The intracellular fragment of HER4 was sufficient to confer this phenotype . HER4 functions as a cell cycle suppressor , maintaining resistance to cellular stress . The current findings indicate that HER4 overexpression may be associated with refractory disease , and HER4 may be an important therapeutic target .
Gastrin stimulates the growth of pancreatic cancer cells through the activation of the cholecystokinin-B receptor ( CCK-BR ) , which has been found to be overexpressed in pancreatic cancer . In this study , we proposed that the CCK-BR drives growth of pancreatic cancer ; hence , interruption of CCK-BR activity could potentially be an ideal target for cancer therapeutics . The effect of CCK-BR downregulation in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells was examined by utilizing specific CCK-BR-targeted RNA interference reagents . The CCK-BR receptor expression was both transiently and stably downregulated by transfection with selective CCK-BR small-interfering RNA or short-hairpin RNA , respectively , and the effects on cell growth and apoptosis were assessed . CCK-BR downregulation resulted in reduced cancer cell proliferation , decreased DNA synthesis , and cell cycle arrest as demonstrated by an inhibition of G(1) to S phase progression . Furthermore , CCK-BR downregulation increased caspase-3 activity , TUNEL-positive cells , and decreased X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression , suggesting apoptotic activity . Pancreatic cancer cell mobility was decreased when the CCK-BR was downregulated , as assessed by a migration assay . These results show the importance of the CCK-BR in regulation of growth and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer . Strategies to decrease the CCK-BR expression and activity may be beneficial for the development of new methods to improve the treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer .
Furan , a potent rodent liver carcinogen , is found in many cooked food items and thus represents a human cancer risk . Mechanisms for furan carcinogenicity were investigated in male F344 rats using the in vivo Comet and micronucleus assays , combined with analysis of histopathological and gene expression changes . In addition , formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase ( Fpg ) and endonuclease III ( EndoIII)-sensitive DNA damage was monitored as a measure of oxidative DNA damage . Rats were treated by gavage on four consecutive days with 2 , 4 , and 8mg/kg bw furan , doses that were tumorigenic in 2-year cancer bioassays , and with two higher doses , 12 and 16mg/kg . Rats were killed 3h after the last dose , a time established as producing maximum levels of DNA damage in livers of furan-treated rats . Liver Comet assays indicated that both DNA strand breaks and oxidized purines and pyrimidines increased in a near-linear dose-responsive fashion , with statistically significant increases detected at cancer bioassay doses . No DNA damage was detected in bone marrow , a non-target tissue for cancer , and peripheral blood micronucleus assays were negative . Histopathological evaluation of liver from furan-exposed animals produced evidence of inflammation , single-cell necrosis , apoptosis , and cell proliferation . In addition , genes related to apoptosis , cell-cycle checkpoints , and DNA-repair were expressed at a slightly lower level in the furan-treated livers . Although a mixed mode of action involving direct DNA binding cannot be ruled out , the data suggest that furan induces cancer in rat livers mainly through a secondary genotoxic mechanism involving oxidative stress , accompanied by inflammation , cell proliferation , and toxicity .
Contact-inhibition ubiquitously exists in non-transformed cells and explains the poor regenerative capacity of in vivo human retinal pigment epithelial cells ( RPE ) during aging , injury and diseases . RPE injury or degeneration may unlock mitotic block mediated by contact inhibition but may also promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) contributing to retinal blindness . Herein , we confirmed that EMT ensued in post-confluent ARPE-19 cells when contact inhibition was disrupted with EGTA followed by addition of EGF and FGF-2 because of activation of canonical Wnt and Smad/ZEB signaling . In contrast , knockdown of p120-catenin ( p120 ) unlocked such mitotic block by activating p120/Kaiso , but not activating canonical Wnt and Smad/ZEB signaling , thus avoiding EMT . Nuclear BrdU labeling was correlated with nuclear release of Kaiso through p120 nuclear translocation , which was associated with activation of RhoA-ROCK signaling , destabilization of microtubules . Prolonged p120 siRNA knockdown followed by withdrawal further expanded RPE into more compact monolayers with a normal phenotype and a higher density . This new strategy based on selective activation of p120/Kaiso but not Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling obviates the need of using single cells and the risk of EMT , and may be deployed to engineer surgical grafts containing RPE and other tissues .
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality underscoring the need for safe and effective chemopreventive strategies . Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is attractive in that it is an early critical event in HNSCC pathogenesis . However , current agents lack efficacy or have unacceptable toxicity . Several groups have demonstrated that the over-the-counter medication , polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) has remarkable chemopreventive efficacy against colon carcinogenesis . Importantly , we reported that this effect is mediated through EGFR internalization/degradation . In the current study , we investigated the chemopreventive efficacy of this agent against HNSCC , using both the well validated animal model 4-NQO ( 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide ) rat model and cell culture with the human HNSCC cell line SCC-25 . We demonstrated that daily topical application of 10% PEG-8000 in the oral cavity ( tongue and cavity wall ) post 4NQO initiation resulted in a significant reduction in tumor burden ( both , tumor size and tumors/tumor bearing rat ) without any evidence of toxicity . Immunohistochemical studies depicted decreased proliferation ( number of Ki67-positive cells ) and reduced expression of EGFR and its downstream effectors cyclin D1 in the tongue mucosa of 4NQO-rats treated with PEG . We showed that EGFR was also markedly downregulated in SCC-25 cells by PEG-8000 with a concomitant induction of G1-S phase cell-cycle arrest , which was potentially mediated through upregulated p21(cip1/waf1) . In conclusion , we demonstrate , for the first time , that PEG has promising efficacy and safety as a chemopreventive efficacy against oral carcinogenesis .
To elucidate the function of MAS-related GPCR , member D ( MRGD ) in cancers , we investigated the in vitro and in vivo oncogenic function of MRGD using murine fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 in which MRGD is stably expressed . The expression pattern of MRGD in clinical samples was also analyzed . We found that overexpression of MRGD in NIH3T3 induced focus formation and multi-cellular spheroid formation , and promoted tumors in nude mice . In other words , overexpression of MRGD in NIH3T3 induced the loss of contact inhibition , anchorage-independent growth and in vivo tumorigenesis . Furthermore , it was found that the ligand of MRGD , beta-alanine , enhanced spheroid formation in MRGD-expressing NIH3T3 cells . From investigation of clinical cancer tissues , we found high expression of MRGD in several lung cancers by immunohistochemistry as well as real time PCR . Based on these results , MRGD could be involved in tumorigenesis and could also be a novel anticancer drug target .
Contact inhibition of locomotion ( CIL ) is the process by which cells stop the continual migration in the same direction after collision with another cell . Highly invasive malignant cells exhibit diminished CIL when they contact stromal cells , which allows invasion of the tissue by tumors . We show that Nm23-H1 is essential for the suppression of Rac1 through inactivation of Tiam1 at the sites of cell-cell contact , which plays a pivotal role in CIL . U87MG cells show CIL when they contact normal glia . In spheroid confrontation assays U87MG cells showed only limited invasion of the glial population , but reduction of Nm23-H1 expression in U87MG cells abrogated CIL resulting in invasion . In U87MG cells , Nm23-H1 is translocated to the sites of contact with glia through association with \u03b1-catenin and N-cadherin . Mutants of Nm23-H1 , which lacked the binding ability with Tiam1 , or \u03b1-catenin did not restore CIL . Moreover , the expression of ephrin-B1 in tumor cells disrupted CIL and promoted invasion . As one mechanism , ephrin-B1 inhibits the association of Nm23-H1 with Tiam1 , which contributes for activation of Rac1 . These results indicate a novel function of Nm23-H1 to control CIL , and its negative regulation by ephrin-B1 .
Sirtuin proteins regulate diverse cellular pathways that influence genomic stability , metabolism and ageing . SIRT7 is a mammalian sirtuin whose biochemical activity , molecular targets and physiological functions have been unclear . Here we show that SIRT7 is an NAD(+)-dependent H3K18Ac ( acetylated lysine 18 of histone H3 ) deacetylase that stabilizes the transformed state of cancer cells . Genome-wide binding studies reveal that SIRT7 binds to promoters of a specific set of gene targets , where it deacetylates H3K18Ac and promotes transcriptional repression . The spectrum of SIRT7 target genes is defined in part by its interaction with the cancer-associated E26 transformed specific ( ETS ) transcription factor ELK4 , and comprises numerous genes with links to tumour suppression . Notably , selective hypoacetylation of H3K18Ac has been linked to oncogenic transformation , and in patients is associated with aggressive tumour phenotypes and poor prognosis . We find that deacetylation of H3K18Ac by SIRT7 is necessary for maintaining essential features of human cancer cells , including anchorage-independent growth and escape from contact inhibition . Moreover , SIRT7 is necessary for a global hypoacetylation of H3K18Ac associated with cellular transformation by the viral oncoprotein E1A . Finally , SIRT7 depletion markedly reduces the tumorigenicity of human cancer cell xenografts in mice . Together , our work establishes SIRT7 as a highly selective H3K18Ac deacetylase and demonstrates a pivotal role for SIRT7 in chromatin regulation , cellular transformation programs and tumour formation in vivo .
Liver cancer ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignancy of all cancers worldwide . According to the principles of traditional Chinese medicine , liver Yin deficiency is a common clinical syndrome of liver cancer , and tonifying liver Yin is a common treatment method for liver cancer . However , no hepatocarcinoma-specific liver Yin tonifying formula has yet been established . In the present study , we established a liver cancer-specific combination of herbs , which we term liver Yin tonifying formula ( LYTF ) . We found that LYTF inhibits the proliferation of Bel-7402 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner . LYTF induces apoptosis in Bel-7402 cells , which is accompanied by activation of caspases-8 , -9 and -3 . Pan-caspase blocking completely abrogates LYTF-induced apoptosis and partially abrogates LYTF-induced proliferation inhibition . LYTF also induces cell senescence , as indicated by a large and flattened morphology , senescence-activated beta-galactosidase-positive staining and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest , accompanied by the up-regulation of p16 and p21 and the down-regulation of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation . These findings suggest that LYTF is effective in inhibiting the growth and survival of hepatocarcinoma cells through the induction of apoptosis and cell senescence . Our study also provides insight into traditional Chinese medicine methods used for the treatment of liver cancer .
Contact inhibition is a crucial mechanism regulating proliferation in vitro and in vivo . Although it is generally accepted that contact inhibition plays a pivotal role in maintaining tissue homeostasis , the molecular mechanisms of contact inhibition are still not fully understood . FoxM1 is known as a proliferation-associated transcription factor and is upregulated in many cancer types . Vice versa , anti-proliferative signals , such as TGF-\u03b2 and differentiation signals decrease FoxM1 expression . Here we investigated the role of FoxM1 in contact inhibition in fibroblasts . We show that protein expression of FoxM1 is severely and rapidly downregulated upon contact inhibition , probably by inhibition of ERK activity , which then leads to decreased expression of cyclin A and polo-like kinase 1 . Vice versa , ectopic expression of FoxM1 prevents the decrease in cyclin A and polo-like kinase 1 and causes a two-fold increase in saturation density indicating loss of contact inhibition . Hence , we show that downregulation of FoxM1 is required for contact inhibition by regulating expression of cyclin A and polo-like kinase 1 .
Blind mole rats Spalax ( BMR ) are small subterranean rodents common in the Middle East . BMR is distinguished by its adaptations to life underground , remarkable longevity ( with a maximum documented lifespan of 21 y ) , and resistance to cancer . Spontaneous tumors have never been observed in spalacids . To understand the mechanisms responsible for this resistance , we examined the growth of BMR fibroblasts in vitro of the species Spalax judaei and Spalax golani . BMR cells proliferated actively for 7-20 population doublings , after which the cells began secreting IFN-\u03b2 , and the cultures underwent massive necrotic cell death within 3 d . The necrotic cell death phenomenon was independent of culture conditions or telomere shortening . Interestingly , this cell behavior was distinct from that observed in another long-lived and cancer-resistant African mole rat , Heterocephalus glaber , the naked mole rat in which cells display hypersensitivity to contact inhibition . Sequestration of p53 and Rb proteins using SV40 large T antigen completely rescued necrotic cell death . Our results suggest that cancer resistance of BMR is conferred by massive necrotic response to overproliferation mediated by p53 and Rb pathways , and triggered by the release of IFN-\u03b2 . Thus , we have identified a unique mechanism that contributes to cancer resistance of this subterranean mammal extremely adapted to life underground .
Mps one binder 1a ( MOB1A ) and MOB1B are key components of the Hippo signaling pathway and are mutated or inactivated in many human cancers . Here we show that intact Mob1a or Mob1b is essential for murine embryogenesis and that loss of the remaining WT Mob1 allele in Mob1a(\u0394/\u0394)1b(tr/+) or Mob1a(\u0394/+)1b(tr/tr) mice results in tumor development . Because most of these cancers resembled trichilemmal carcinomas , we generated double-mutant mice bearing tamoxifen-inducible , keratinocyte-specific homozygous-null mutations of Mob1a and Mob1b ( kDKO mice). kDKO mice showed hyperplastic keratinocyte progenitors and defective keratinocyte terminal differentiation and soon died of malnutrition. kDKO keratinocytes exhibited hyperproliferation , apoptotic resistance , impaired contact inhibition , enhanced progenitor self renewal , and increased centrosomes . Examination of Hippo pathway signaling in kDKO keratinocytes revealed that loss of Mob1a/b altered the activities of the downstream Hippo mediators LATS and YAP1 . Similarly , YAP1 was activated in some human trichilemmal carcinomas , and some of these also exhibited MOB1A/1B inactivation . Our results clearly demonstrate that MOB1A and MOB1B have overlapping functions in skin homeostasis , and exert their roles as tumor suppressors by regulating downstream elements of the Hippo pathway .
Osteosarcoma is a high-grade malignant bone tumor that manifests ingravescent clinical behavior . The intrinsic events that confer malignant properties on osteosarcoma cells have remained unclear , however . We previously established two lines of mouse osteosarcoma cells : AX cells , which are able to form tumors in syngeneic mice , and AXT cells , which were derived from such tumors and acquired an increased tumorigenic capacity during tumor development . We have now identified Igf2 mRNA-binding protein3 ( Imp3 ) as a key molecule responsible for this increased tumorigenicity of AXT cells in vivo . Imp3 is consistently up-regulated in tumors formed by AX cells , and its expression in these cells was found to confer malignant properties such as anchorage-independent growth , loss of contact inhibition , and escape from anoikis in vitro . The expression level of Imp3 also appeared directly related to tumorigenic ability in vivo which is the critical determination for tumor-initiating cells . The effect of Imp3 on tumorigenicity of osteosarcoma cells did not appear to be mediated through Igf2-dependent mechanism . Our results implicate Imp3 as a key regulator of stem-like tumorigenic characteristics in osteosarcoma cells and as a potential therapeutic target for this malignancy .
The tumor suppressors Lats1 and Lats2 are mediators of the Hippo pathway that regulates tissue growth and proliferation . Their N-terminal non-kinase regions are distinct except for Lats conserved domains 1 and 2 ( LCD1 and LCD2 ) , which may be important for Lats1/2-specific functions . Lats1 knockout mice were generated by disrupting the N-terminal region containing LCD1 ( Lats1(\u0394N/\u0394N) ) . Some Lats1(\u0394N/\u0394N) mice were born safely and grew normally . However , mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) from Lats1(\u0394N/\u0394N) mice displayed mitotic defects , centrosomal overduplication , chromosomal misalignment , multipolar spindle formation , chromosomal bridging and cytokinesis failure . They also showed anchorage-independent growth and continued cell cycles and cell growth , bypassing cell-cell contact inhibition similar to tumor cells . Lats1(\u0394N/\u0394N) MEFs produced tumors in nude mice after subcutaneous injection , although the tumor growth rate was much slower than that of ordinary cancer cells . Yap , a key transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo pathway , was overexpressed and stably retained in Lats1(\u0394N/\u0394N) MEFs in a cell density independent manner , and Lats2 mRNA expression was downregulated . In conclusion , N-terminally truncated Lats1 induced Lats2 downregulation and Yap protein accumulation , leading to chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis .
Aurora A kinase has drawn considerable attention as a therapeutic target for cancer therapy . However , the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of the anticancer effects of Aurora A kinase inhibition are still not fully understood . Herein , we show that depletion of Aurora A kinase by RNA interference ( RNAi ) in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells upregulated FoxO1 in a p53-dependent manner , which induces cell cycle arrest . Introduction of an RNAi-resistant Aurora A kinase into Aurora A-knockdown cells resulted in downregulation of FoxO1 expression and rescued proliferation . In addition , silencing of FoxO1 in Aurora A-knockdown cells allowed the cells to exit cytostatic arrest , which , in turn , led to massive cell death . Our results suggest that FoxO1 is responsible for growth arrest at the G 2/M phase that is induced by Aurora A kinase inhibition .
It is now largely accepted that ribosomal proteins may be implicated in a variety of biological functions besides that of components of the translation machinery . Many evidences show that a subset of ribosomal proteins are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis through modulation of p53 activity . In addition , p53-independent mechanisms of cell cycle arrest in response to alterations of ribosomal proteins availability have been described . Here , we identify human rpL3 as a new regulator of cell cycle and apoptosis through positive regulation of p21 expression in a p53-independent system . We demonstrate that the rpL3-mediated p21 upregulation requires the specific interaction between rpL3 and Sp1 . Furthermore , in our experimental system , p21 overexpression leads to a dual outcome , activating the G\u2081/S arrest of the cell cycle or the apoptotic pathway through mitochondria , depending on its intracellular levels . It is noteworthy that depletion of p21 abrogates both effects . Taken together , our findings unravel a novel extraribosomal function of rpL3 and reinforce the proapoptotic role of p21 in addition to its widely reported ability as an inhibitor of cell proliferation .
Environmental or occupational exposure to low doses of arsenic induces a series of health problems including cancer . The molecular events in arsenic-induced carcinogenicity remain to be defined . In the NuLi-1 immortalized human lung epithelial cell line with p53 and pRb deficiency , exposure to low doses of arsenic trioxide for 72 h promoted cell proliferation and upregulated the gene transcription levels of FOXM1 , CDC6 , CDC25A , and cyclin D1 , which are both critical cell cycle regulatory genes and proto-oncogenes . Continuous in vitro exposure to 1 <FFFD>M arsenic trioxide for 34 wks induced malignant cell transformation , as evidenced by enhanced anchorage-independent cell growth . The expression of FOXM1 , CDC6 , CDC25A , and Cyclin D1 was dynamically elevated at the gene transcription and protein levels in the process of cell transformation . The carcinogenic ability of transformed cell colonies coincides with the expression levels of FOXM1 in in vitro anchorage-independent growth assays and in vivo tumor xenograft formation assays . In reverse , the knockdown of FOXM1 in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells or arsenic-transformed NuLi-1 cells significantly decreased anchorage-independent cell growth and tumor xenograft formation . The transformed NuLi-1 cells showed genomic instability in the form of copy number variation ( CNV ) at chromosome 1 , 5 , 6 , 18 , and 20 , but not loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) . These results showed for the first time that chronic exposure to low doses of arsenic trioxide promoted lung carcinogenicity , in part by aberrantly upregulating FOXM1 and its associated oncogenes , when the tumor suppressor genes p53 and pRb were inactivated. <FFFD> 2012 Wiley Periodicals , Inc .
Capsaicin , one of the major pungent ingredients found in red peppers , has been recently demonstrated to induce apoptosis in various malignant cell lines through an unclear mechanism . In this study , the effect of capsaicin on proliferation and apoptosis in the human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 and its possible mechanism(s) of action were investigated . The results of a Cell Counting Kit-8 ( CCK-8 ) assay revealed that capsaicin significantly decreased the viability of PANC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner . Capsaicin induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PANC-1 cells as demonstrated by a flow cytometric assessment . Caspase-3 expression at both the protein and mRNA level was promoted following capsaicin treatment . Furthermore , we revealed that phospho-PI3 Kinase p85 ( Tyr458 ) and phospho-Akt ( Ser473 ) in PANC-1 cells were downregulated in response to capsaicin . Moreover , capsaicin gavage significantly inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cell xenografts in athymic nude mice . An increased number of TUNEL-positive cells and cleaved caspase-3 were observed in capsaicin-treated mice . In vivo , capsaicin downregulated the expression of phospho-PI3 Kinase p85 ( Tyr458 ) and phospho-Akt ( Ser473 ) . In conclusion , we have demonstrated that capsaicin is an inhibitor of growth of PANC-1 cells , and downregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway may be involved in capsaicin-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo .
Radix of Asiasarum heterotropoides var. mandshuricum F. Maekawa ( A. radix ) has been prescribed for treating pain , allergies and inflammatory disorders in traditional oriental medicine . However , only limited information on the anticancer effects of A. radix is currently available . The aim of this study was to determine the anticancer effect of the ethanol extract of A. radix ( EEAR ) on HCT-116 human colon cancer cells and to investigate its underlying mechanisms of action . EEAR significantly induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HCT-116 cells . EEAR-induced apoptosis was observed in parallel with activation of caspases and an increased ratio of Bax ( pro-apoptotic)/Bcl2 ( anti-apoptotic ) . Western blot analyses revealed that EEAR elevated the expression of p53 and p21(Waf/Cip1) and decreased the expression of the regulator proteins of G2/M phase progression , such as cdc2 and cyclin B. The upregulation of p53 by EEAR was due to the increased levels of p53 mRNA without a similar increase in proteasome-mediated p53 degradation . EEAR-induced apoptosis in HCT-116 cells was dependent on p53 expression , as determined by siRNA-mediated p53 knockdown . Taken together , these results suggest that EEAR inhibits the growth of the HCT-116 cells through induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis , which are mediated by p53 expression .
Gefitinib , the specific inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , may cause growth delay in cancer cell lines . Thorough understanding of the downstream cellular signaling of gefitinib will facilitate the discovery of biomarkers for predicting outcomes and monitoring anti-EGFR therapies , and provide information for key targets for therapeutic intervention . In this study , we investigated the role of transducer of erbB2.1 ( TOB1 ) in gefitinib therapy . Using the lung carcinoma cell lines A549 and NCI-H1975 , the results suggested that gefitinib might mediate cell cycle arrest in lung cancer cells at least by targeting TOB1 expression . Gefitinib treatment caused cell cycle arrest predominantly at the G1 phase , which is associated with TOB1 nuclear translocation and its interaction with cyclin D1 . We also showed that knockdown of TOB1 expression by RNAi rescued lung cancer cells from gefitinib-induced cell-proliferative arrest . These results suggest that TOB1 interaction with cyclin D1 and nuclear translocation is directly involved in the gefitinib-induced anti-proliferative cell cycle arrest .
Acute leukemia is a disorder of the hematopoietic system characterized by the expansion of a clonal population of cells blocked from differentiating into mature cells . Recent studies have shown that chalcones and their derivatives induce apoptosis in different cell lines . Since new compounds with biological activity are needed , the aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of three synthetic chalcones , derived from 1-naphthaldehyde and 2-naphthaldehyde , on human acute myeloid leukemia K562 cells and on human acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells . Based on the results , the most cytotoxic compound ( A1 ) was chosen for further analysis in six human acute leukemia cells and in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line ( HT-29 ) . Chalcone A1 significantly reduced the cell viability of K562 , Jurkat , Kasumi , U937 , CEM and NB4 cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner when compared with the control group ( IC(50) values between ~1.5muM and 40muM ) . It was also cytotoxic to HL-29 cells . To further examine its effect on normal cells , peripheral blood lymphocytes collected from healthy volunteers were incubated with the compound . It has also been incubated with human fibroblasts cultured from bone marrow ( JMA ) . Chalcone A1 is non-cytotoxic to PBL cells and to JMA cells . A1 caused significant cell cycle arrest in all phases according to the cell line , and increased the proportion of cells in the sub G0/G1 phase . To evaluate whether this chalcone induced cell death via an apoptotic or necrotic pathway , cell morphology was examined using fluorescence microscopy . Cells treated with A1 at IC(50) demonstrated the morphological characteristic of apoptosis , such as chromatin condensation and formation of apoptotic bodies . Apoptosis was confirmed by externalization of phosphatidylserine , which was detected by the Annexin V-FITC method , and by DNA fragmentation . The results suggest that chalcone A1 has potential as a new lead compound for cancer therapy .
BACKGROUND : Although quiescence ( reversible cell cycle arrest ) is a key part in the life history and fate of many mammalian cell types , the mechanisms of gene regulation in quiescent cells are poorly understood . We sought to clarify the role of microRNAs as regulators of the cellular functions of quiescent human fibroblasts . RESULTS : Using microarrays , we discovered that the expression of the majority of profiled microRNAs differed between proliferating and quiescent fibroblasts . Fibroblasts induced into quiescence by contact inhibition or serum starvation had similar microRNA profiles , indicating common changes induced by distinct quiescence signals . By analyzing the gene expression patterns of microRNA target genes with quiescence , we discovered a strong regulatory function for miR-29 , which is downregulated with quiescence . Using microarrays and immunoblotting , we confirmed that miR-29 targets genes encoding collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins and that those target genes are induced in quiescence . In addition , overexpression of miR-29 resulted in more rapid cell cycle re-entry from quiescence . We also found that let-7 and miR-125 were upregulated in quiescent cells . Overexpression of either one alone resulted in slower cell cycle re-entry from quiescence , while the combination of both together slowed cell cycle re-entry even further . CONCLUSIONS : microRNAs regulate key aspects of fibroblast quiescence including the proliferative state of the cells as well as their gene expression profiles , in particular , the induction of extracellular matrix proteins in quiescent fibroblasts .
Breast cancer constitutes a major health problem for women worldwide . However , its incidence varies between populations and geographical locations . These variations could be diet-related , since there are several carcinogenic compounds in the modern diet , while natural products contain various anti-cancer elements . Several lines of evidence indicate that , in addition to their clear preventive effect , these compounds could also be used as therapeutic agents . In the present report we have shown that oleuropein , a pharmacologically safe natural product of olive leaf , has potent anti-breast cancer properties . Indeed , oleuropein exhibits specific cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells , with higher effect on the basal-like MDA-MB-231 cells than on the luminal MCF-7 cells . This effect is mediated through the induction of apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway . Moreover , oleuropein inhibits cell proliferation by delaying the cell cycle at S phase and up-regulated the cyclin-dependent inhibitor p21 . Furthermore , oleuropein inhibited the anti-apoptosis and pro-proliferation protein NF-kappaB and its main oncogenic target cyclin D1 . This inhibition could explain the great effect of oleuropein on cell proliferation and cell death of breast cancer cells . Therefore , oleuropein warrants further investigations to prove its utility in preventing/treating breast cancer , especially the less-responsive basal-like type .
BACKGROUND : CD81 is a transmembrane protein that serves as a putative receptor for hepatitis C virus . In addition , CD81 has been suggested to be involved in a broad range of other cellular functions . Its putative implication in tumorigenesis has so far , however , remained largely unexplored . To assess the candidacy of CD81 as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer development , we investigated its expression and function in a series of primary gastric tumors and gastric tumor-derived cell lines . METHODS : The expression and concomitant methylation status of the CD81 gene and its effect on tumor development and cellular signaling were evaluated . RESULTS : CD81 mRNA levels were found to be low in 16 of 40 ( 40% ) primary tumors and 9 of 14 ( 64.2% ) cell lines , and these low expression levels were found to correlate with the stage and grade of the tumors . Genomic alterations of CD81 were not encountered , whereas its expression could be re-activated in low expressing cells upon 5-aza-dC treatment . Bisulfite DNA sequencing analysis of 10 CpG sites within the 5 ' proximal region of the CD81 gene promoter revealed that the observed transcriptional silencing was tightly associated with aberrant hypermethylation . Subsequent restoration of CD81 expression induced a G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis , whereas siRNA-mediated CD81 down-regulation promoted cell proliferation and attenuated cellular responses to various apoptotic stress stimuli . Also the colony-forming ability of the tumor cells could be inhibited and enhanced through CD81 up- and down-regulation , respectively . CD81 was found to inhibit p38 ( but not ERK , JNK and AKT ) phosphorylation and its growth suppressive effect could be abolished through p38 up- and down-regulation . CONCLUSION : From our data we conclude that epigenetic inactivation of CD81 is a common feature of gastric tumors and that this inactivation may render growth and survival advantages to the tumor cells , at least partially through p38 signaling .
Pterostilbene , a polyphenolic compound present in grapes and other fruits , has been demonstrated to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis and autophagy in some cancer cell types . We found that pterostilbene at the IC90 concentration of 44 <FFFD>M inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in MOLT4 human leukemia cells . Treatment with pterostilbene resulted in a transient accumulation of cells in the G0/G1-cell cycle phase followed by the S-phase arrest . Pterostilbene-induced apoptotic death of MOLT4 cells was mediated by caspase-3 activation and was accompanied by the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential , phosphatidylserine externalization and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation . Our results suggest that pterostilbene could serve as a potential additional chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of leukemia .
Abstract Different cyclooxygenase ( COX)-2 inhibitors were known to cause different cell cycle changes . We investigated whether this different effect on cell cycle change was due to concentration-dependent effect . We investigated the effects of celecoxib , a COX-2 selective inhibitor , on cell cycle regulation in irradiated cancer cells that express high or low levels of COX-2 . Four stably COX-2 knocked-down or overexpressed cell lines were treated with various concentrations of celecoxib with or without radiation . Celecoxib differentially modulated the cell cycle according to the concentrations applied . G(1) arrest was induced at lower concentrations , whereas G(2)/M arrest was induced at higher concentrations in each cell line tested . Radiation-induced G(2)/M arrest was enhanced at lower concentrations but reduced at higher concentrations . The cutoff values to divide lower and higher concentrations were cell-type specific . Celecoxib treatment activated Cdc25C and inhibited p21 expression in both unirradiated and irradiated cells , regardless of COX-2 expression . Apoptosis was induced in irradiated cells 48 hours after treatment with celecoxib dependent of COX-2 . These results imply that celecoxib deactivates the G(2) checkpoint via both Cdc25C- and p21-dependent pathways in irradiated cells , which subsequently die by secondary apoptosis . Cell cycle modulating effects in irradiated cells resulting from treatment with celecoxib may have clinical importance with regard to the potential application of celecoxib in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy .
Recently , our group reported the discovery of three new withanolides , physangulidines A-C , from Physalis angulata . In this study , the biological effects of physangulidine A ( 1 ) , which was the most active and abundant of the three new constituents , are described . It was found that 1 significantly reduces survival in clonogenic assays for two hormone-independent prostate cancer cell lines . Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy studies in DU145 human prostate cancer cells indicated that 1 induces cell cycle arrest in the G(2)/M phase and causes defective mitosis . It was determined also that 1 produces programed cell death by apoptosis , as evidenced by biochemical markers and distinct changes in cell morphology . These results imply that the antimitotic and proapoptotic effects of 1 may contribute significantly to the biological activities and potential medicinal properties of its plant of origin .
AIM : To explore the inhibitory effect of sulfated polysaccharide from Masson pine ( Pinus massoniana ) pollen ( SPPM60 ) on G(2)/M phase of human liver cancer HepG2 cells and its mechanism . METHODS : The proliferation rate of HepG2 cells was evaluated by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT ) colorimetric assay . The cycles of HepG2 cells were measured by flow cytometry when 200mug/ml concentration of SPPM60 was adopted , the expression of the genes related to cell cycle was detected by real-time PCR . RESULTS : SPPM60 inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells and the inhibition rate was elevated with increase of SPPM60 concentration . After treatment with 200mug/ml of SPPM60 , the percentage of S phase cells was decreased , but that of G(2)/M phase was significantly increased ( 72h vs control : 32.96<FFFD>0.33% vs 18.59<FFFD>0.04% , 3.44<FFFD>0.05% vs 18.30<FFFD>0.08% , P<0.01 ) . The results of real-time PCR showed that SPPM60 could down-regulate the mRNA levels of CDK1 and CyclinB ( P<0.01 ) , and up-regulate the expression of p53 and p21 ( P<0.05 ) . CONCLUSION : SPPM60 causes arrest of HepG2 cells at G(2)/M phase , and the mechanism is related to the down-regulation of CDK1 and CyclinB and up-regulation of p53 and p21 expression .
Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) is a fatal pediatric disease . Thus far no therapeutic agent has proven beneficial in the treatment of this malignancy . Hence , conventional DNA-damaging radiotherapy ( RT ) remains the standard treatment , providing transient neurological improvement without improving probability of overall survival . During RT , WEE1 kinase controls the G2 cell cycle checkpoint allowing for repair of irradiation ( IR)-induced DNA damage . Here we show that WEE1 kinase is one of the highest overexpressed kinases in primary DIPG tissues as compared to matching non-neoplastic brain tissues . Inhibition of WEE1 by MK-1775 treatment of DIPG cells inhibited the IR-induced WEE1-mediated phosphorylation of CDC2 , resulting in reduced G2/M arrest and decreased cell viability . Finally , we demonstrate that MK-1775 enhances the radiation response of E98-Fluc-mCherry DIPG mouse xenografts . Altogether , these results show that inhibition of WEE1 kinase in conjunction with RT holds potential as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of DIPG .
The role of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-20 ( IL-20 ) has not yet been studied in cancer biology . Here , we demonstrated up-regulation of both IL-20 and IL-20R1 in muscle invasive bladder cancer ( MIBC ) patients . The expressions of IL-20 and IL-20R1 were observed in bladder cancer 5637 and T-24 cells . We found that IL-20 significantly increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-9 via binding activity of NF-kappaB and AP-1 in bladder cancer cells and stimulated the activation of ERK1/2 , JNK , p38MAPK , and Jak-Stat signaling . Among the pathways examined , only ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 significantly inhibited IL-20-induced migration and invasion . Moreover , siRNA knockdown of IL-20R1 suppressed migration , invasion , ERK1/2 activation , and NF-kappaB-mediated MMP-9 expression induced by IL-20 . Unexpectedly , cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1 was induced by IL-20 treatment without altering cell cycle progression . Blockade of p21WAF1 function by siRNA reversed migration , invasion , activation of ERK signaling , MMP-9 expression , and activation of NF-kappaB in IL-20-treated cells . In addition , IL-20 induced the activation of IKK , the degradation and phosphorylation of IkappaBa , and NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation , which was regulated by ERK1/2 . IL-20 stimulated the recruitment of p65 to the MMP-9 promoter region . Finally , the IL-20-induced migration and invasion of cells was confirmed by IL-20 gene transfection and by addition of anti-IL-20 antibody . This is the first report that p21WAF1 is involved in ERK1/2-mediated MMP-9 expression via increased binding activity of NF-kappaB , which resulted in the induction of migration in IL-20/IL-20R1 dyad-induced bladder cancer cells . These unexpected results might provide a critical new target for the treatment of bladder cancer .
Loss of p53 is considered to allow progression of colorectal tumors from the adenoma to the carcinoma stage . Using mice with an intestinal epithelial cell ( IEC)-specific p53 deletion , we demonstrate that loss ofp53 alone is insufficient to initiate intestinal tumorigenesis but markedly enhances carcinogen-induced tumor incidence and leads to invasive cancer and lymph node metastasis . Whereas p53 controls DNA damage and IEC survival during the initiation stage , loss of p53 during tumor progression is associated with increased intestinal permeability , causing formation of an NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory microenvironment and the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition . Thus , we propose a p53-controlled tumor-suppressive function that is independent of its well-established role in cell-cycle regulation , apoptosis , and senescence .
Binding within or nearby target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival enables the p53 tumor suppressor gene to regulate their transcription and cell-cycle progression . Using genome-wide chromatin-binding profiles , we describe binding of p53 also to regions located distantly from any known p53 target gene . Interestingly , many of these regions possess conserved p53-binding sites and all known hallmarks of enhancer regions . We demonstrate that these p53-bound enhancer regions ( p53BERs ) indeed contain enhancer activity and interact intrachromosomally with multiple neighboring genes to convey long-distance p53-dependent transcription regulation . Furthermore , p53BERs produce , ina p53-dependent manner , enhancer RNAs ( eRNAs ) that are required for efficient transcriptional enhancement of interacting target genes and induction of a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest . Thus , our results ascribe transcription enhancement activity to p53 with the capacity to regulate multiple genes from a single genomic binding site . Moreover , eRNA production from p53BERs is required for efficient p53 transcription enhancement .
Indolylmaleimides display a broad spectrum of biological activity and offer great opportunity to influence several aspects of cell fate , as proliferation and differentiation . In this study we describe the effect of PDA-66 , a newly synthesised indolylmaleimide , showing a strong dose dependent anti-proliferative effect on immortalised human progenitor and cancer cells . We demonstrated a highly depolymerizing effect on in vitro tubulin assembly and conclude that PDA-66 acts as microtubule destabilising agent . In addition we found that PDA-66 induces mitotic arrest of cells in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle . Subsequently cells undergo apoptosis , indicating the major mechanism of the anti-proliferative effect . To prove a potential anti-cancer activity of PDA-66 we examined the effect of PDA-66 on human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and A-459 lung cancer cells , showing a significant reduction in cancer cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner . Thus PDA-66 is a new anti-mitotic compound with an indole-core with the potential to be used for cancer therapy .
Compound C , a well-known inhibitor of the intracellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , has been reported to cause apoptotic cell death in myeloma , breast cancer cells and glioma cells . In this study , we have demonstrated that compound C not only induced autophagy in all tested skin cancer cell lines but also caused more apoptosis in p53 wildtype skin cancer cells than in p53-mutant skin cancer cells . Compound C can induce upregulation , phosphorylation and nuclear translocalization of the p53 protein and upregulate expression of p53 target genes in wildtype p53-expressing skin basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) cells . The changes of p53 status were dependent on DNA damage which was caused by compound C induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation and associated with activated ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) protein . Using the wildtype p53-expressing BCC cells versus stable p53-knockdown BCC sublines , we present evidence that p53-knockdown cancer cells were much less sensitive to compound C treatment with significant G2/M cell cycle arrest and attenuated the compound C-induced apoptosis but not autophagy . The compound C induced G2/M arrest in p53-knockdown BCC cells was associated with the sustained inactive Tyr15 phosphor-Cdc2 expression . Overall , our results established that compound C-induced apoptosis in skin cancer cells was dependent on the cell's p53 status .
A new line of human ovarian serous adenocarcinoma cells , TU-OS-4 , was established and characterized . The cells showed a short , spindle-shaped morphology and grew in monolayers without contact inhibition while forming an arrangement resembling a jigsaw puzzle . Chromosome numbers ranged from 55 to 73 . The proliferation rate was lower than other serous adenocarcinoma cell lines tested ( KF , SHIN-3 , and SK-OV-3 ) , and the doubling time was 53.3 h . Western blot analysis showed that TU-OS-4 cells overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptor , human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) 2 , and phosphorylated HER2 protein . The IC(50) values to cisplatin , paclitaxel , and lapatinib were 25.8 \u03bcM , 686 nM , and 183 nM , respectively . Heterotransplantation in nude mice reflected the original tumor of the cells . These results suggested that this cell line would be useful to study chemoresistant mechanisms and contribute to establishing novel treatment strategies for patients with ovarian cancer .
It is well established that hyperplasia and decreased apoptosis of airway smooth muscle cells ( ASMCs ) play an important role in the asthmatic airway remodeling . Tumor suppressor PTEN gene with phosphatase activity plays an important regulatory role in embryonic development , cell proliferation , and apoptosis , cell cycle regulation , migration ( invasion ) of the cytoskeleton . We hypotheses that PTEN gene could affect the growth and viability of ASMCs through the regulation of PI3K/Akt , MAPK , and cell cycle-related gene expression . We constructed a recombinant adenovirus to transfect ASMCs . Cells were divided into the overexpression of PTEN gene group ( Ad-PTEN-GFP ) , negative control group ( Ad-GFP ) , and blank control group ( DMEM ) . The cell apoptosis of ASMCs were evaluated by Hoechst-33342 staining and PE-7AAD double-labeled flow cytometry . The cell cycle distribution was observed by flow cytometry with PI staining . The expression of PTEN , p-Akt , total-Akt , p-ERK1/2 , total-ERK1/2 , cleaved-Caspases-3 , Caspases-9 , p21 , and Cyclin D1 were tested by the Western blotting . Our study revealed that overexpression of PTEN gene did not induce apoptosis of human ASMCs cultured in vitro . However , overexpression of PTEN inhibited proliferation of human ASMCs cultured in vitro and was associated with downregulation of Akt phosphorylation levels , while did not affect ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels . Moreover , overexpression of PTEN could induce ASMCs arrested in the G0/G1 phase through the downregulation of Cyclin D1 and upregulation of p21 expressions .
Platinum compounds are the foundation of chemotherapy regimens for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) despite poor response rates and limited response duration . It has been reported that tumor expression of ERCC1 , a key component in nucleotide excision repair , may correlate with clinical response to platinum agents . We found that most primary lung tumor specimens demonstrated a stronger protein expression of poly ( ADP ribose ) polymerases 1 ( PARP1 ) than their normal counterparts . We therefore hypothesized that combining PARP inhibition with platinum compounds may be an approach to improve platinum-based therapy for NSCLC . Drug combination experiments revealed that two distinct PARP inhibitors , olaparib and veliparib not only potentiated the cell killing by cisplatin but also conferred cytotoxicity as a single agent specifically in ERCC1-low HCC827 and PC9 but not in ERCC1-high A549 and H157 lung cancer cells . Moreover , siRNA knockdown of ERCC1 in A549 and H157 cells increased their sensitivities to both cisplatin and olaparib in a synergistic manner in our model . Furthermore , mechanistic studies indicated that combined PARP inhibitor and cisplatin could lead to sustained DNA double strand breaks , prolonged G2/M cell cycle arrest with distinct activation of checkpoint kinase 1 signaling , and more pronounced apoptosis preferentially in lung cancer cells with low ERCC1 expression . Collectively , these data suggest that there is a synergistic relationship between PARP inhibition and low ERCC1 expression in NSCLC that could be exploited for novel therapeutic approaches in lung cancer therapy based on tumor ERCC1 expression .
Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in Western countries . A significant number of CRC patients undergoing curatively intended surgery subsequently develop recurrence and die from the disease . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are aberrantly expressed in cancers and appear to have both diagnostic and prognostic significance . In this study , we identified novel miRNAs associated with recurrence of CRC , and their possible mechanism of action . TaqMan<FFFD> Human MicroRNA Array Set v2.0 was used to profile the expression of 667 miRNAs in 14 normal colon mucosas and 46 microsatellite stable CRC tumors . Four miRNAs ( miR-362-3p , miR-570 , miR-148a* and miR-944 ) were expressed at a higher level in tumors from patients with no recurrence ( p < 0.015 ) , compared to tumors from patients with recurrence . A significant association with increased disease free survival was confirmed for miR-362-3p in a second independent cohort of 43 CRC patients , using single TaqMan<FFFD> microRNA assays . In vitro functional analysis showed that over-expression of miR-362-3p in colon cancer cell lines reduced cell viability , and proliferation mainly due to cell cycle arrest . E2F1 , USF2 and PTPN1 were identified as potential miR-362-3p targets by mRNA profiling of HCT116 cells over-expressing miR-362-3p . Subsequently , these genes were confirmed as direct targets by Luciferase reporter assays . Their knockdown in vitro phenocopied the effects of miR-362-3p over-expression . We conclude that miR-362-3p may be a novel prognostic marker in CRC , and hypothesize that the positive effects of augmented miR-362-3p expression may in part be mediated through the targets E2F1 , USF2 and PTPN1. <FFFD> 2012 Wiley Periodicals , Inc .
The anti-tumor antibiotic salinomycin ( Sal ) was recently identified as a selective inhibitor of breast cancer stem cells ; however , the effect of Sal on hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is not clear . This study aimed to determine the anti-tumor efficacy and mechanism of Sal on HCC . HCC cell lines ( HepG2 , SMMC-7721 , and BEL-7402 ) were treated with Sal . Cell doubling time was determinated by drawing growth curve , cell viability was evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit 8 . The fraction of CD133(+) cell subpopulations was assessed by flow cytometry . We found that Sal inhibits proliferation and decreases PCNA levels as well as the proportion of HCC CD133(+)cell subpopulations in HCC cells . Cell cycle was analyzed using flow cytometry and showed that Sal caused cell cycle arrest of the various HCC cell lines in different phases . Cell apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining . Sal induced apoptosis as characterized by an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio . Several signaling pathways were selected for further mechanistic analyses using real time-PCR and Western blot assays . Compared to control , beta-catenin expression is significantly down-regulated upon Sal addition . The Ca(2+) concentration in HCC cells was examined by flow cytometry and higher Ca(2+) concentrations were observed in Sal treatment groups . The anti-tumor effect of Sal was further verified in vivo using the hepatoma orthotopic tumor model and the data obtained showed that the size of liver tumors in Sal-treated groups decreased compared to controls . Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining also demonstrated that Sal inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in vivo . Finally , the role of Sal on in vivo Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was evaluated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry . This study demonstrates Sal inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo and one potential mechanism is inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling via increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels .
Lung cancers express the cholinergic autocrine loop , which facilitates the progression of cancer cells . The antagonists of mAChRs have been demonstrated to depress the growth of small cell lung cancers ( SCLCs ) . In this study we intended to investigate the growth inhibitory effect of R2HBJJ , a novel muscarinic antagonist , on non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells and the possible mechanisms . The competitive binding assay revealed that R2HBJJ had a high affinity to M3 and M1 AChRs . R2HBJJ presented a strong anticholinergic activity on carbachol-induced contraction of guinea-pig trachea . R2HBJJ markedly suppressed the growth of NSCLC cells , such as H1299 , H460 and H157 . In H1299 cells , both R2HBJJ and its leading compound R2-PHC displayed significant anti-proliferative activity as M3 receptor antagonist darifenacin . Exogenous replenish of ACh could attenuate R2HBJJ-induced growth inhibition . Silencing M3 receptor or ChAT by specific-siRNAs resulted in a growth inhibition of 55.5% and 37.9% on H1299 cells 96 h post transfection , respectively . Further studies revealed that treatment with R2HBJJ arrested the cell cycle in G0/G1 by down-regulation of cyclin D1-CDK4/6-Rb . Therefore , the current study reveals that NSCLC cells express an autocrine and paracrine cholinergic system which stimulates the growth of NSCLC cells . R2HBJJ , as a novel mAChRs antagonist , can block the local cholinergic loop by antagonizing predominantly M3 receptors and inhibit NSCLC cell growth , which suggest that M3 receptor antagonist might be a potential chemotherapeutic regimen for NSCLC .
Recent studies have highlighted an apparently paradoxical link between self-renewal and senescence triggered by DNA damage in certain cell types . In addition , the finding that TP53 can suppress senescence has caused a re-evaluation of its functional role in regulating these outcomes . To investigate these phenomena and their relationship to pluripotency and senescence , we examined the response of the TP53-competent embryonal carcinoma ( EC ) cell line PA1 to etoposide-induced DNA damage . Nuclear POU5F1/OCT4A and p21cip1 were upregulated in the same cells following etoposide-induced G 2M arrest . However , while accumulating in the karyosol , the amount of OCT4A was reduced in the chromatin fraction . Phosphorylated CHK2 and Rad51/gammaH2AX-positive nuclear foci , overexpression of Aurora B kinase and moderate macroautophagy were evident . Upon release from G 2M arrest , cells with repaired DNA entered mitoses , while the cells with persisting DNA damage remained at this checkpoint or underwent mitotic slippage and gradually senesced . Reduction of TP53 using sh- or si-RNA prevented the upregulation of OCT4A and p21cip1 and increased DNA damage . Subsequently , mitoses , micronucleation and senescence were all enhanced after TP53 reduction with senescence confirmed by upregulation of CDKN2A/p16ink4a and increased sa-beta-galactosidase positivity . Those mitoses enhanced by TP53 silencing were shown to be multicentrosomal and multi-polar , containing fragmented and highly deranged chromosomes , indicating a loss of genome integrity . Together , these data suggest that TP53-dependent coupling of self-renewal and senescence pathways through the DNA damage checkpoint provides a mechanism for how embryonal stem cell-like EC cells safeguard DNA integrity , genome stability and ultimately the fidelity of self-renewal .
The increasing evidence supported the role of Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 ( EZH2 ) in the cancer development and progression . However , its precise role in the tumorigenesis of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma ( NPC ) remains to be elucidated . EZH2 was depleted by retroviral infection in the NPC cells ( HK-1 , CNE-2 , CNE-1 and C666-1 ) . The degree of EZH2 knockdown was then assessed by real-time quantitative PCR and Western Blot analysis . Cell proliferation was assessed using the soluble tetrazolium salt ( MTS ) cell proliferation assay , and cell cycle was measured by FACS test . The methylation status of p16(INK4a )was determined by bisulphate treatment of the DNA , followed by MSP . EZH2 was over-expressed in NPC cells , and the expression in undifferentiated-derived NPC cells ( CNE-1 , C666-1 ) was more significant than differentiated-derived NPC cells ( HK-1 , CNE-2 ) . EZH2 was successfully depleted after retroviral infection in C666-1 cells , and the EZH2 depletion could inhibit the proliferation and arrested G1/S phase of NPC cells . In addition , both mRNA and protein levels of p16(INK4a) increased significantly in presence of EZH2 depletion . The further Methylation-Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction ( MSP ) assay suggested that over-expressed EZH2 may contribute to the reduction of p16(INK4a) expression by hyper methylating its promoter . EZH2 is overexpressed in NPC and reduces expression of p16(INK4a) by influencing methylation , opening therapeutic options .
Immunosuppressive oligodeoxynucleotides ( SupODNs ) containing repetitive TTAGGG motifs reduce inflammation and , thus , may have an impact on inflammation-related tumor growth . In this study , we found a significant antiproliferative effect of Sup ODNs on the A549 non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell line compared to those treated with control ODNs ( p<0.05 ) . Sup-ODN-mediated G1 phase cell cycle arrest was achieved via inhibition of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation and the p15INK4b and p27KIP1/retinoblastoma protein pathway . In addition , Sup ODNs induced apoptosis and enhanced apoptosis when combined with vinorelbine . In a setting similar to clinical use of multidrug chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC , these effects were investigated by using Sup ODNs in combination with conventional anticancer drugs . Sup ODNs had a significant synergistic effect with 5-fluorouracil , vinorelbine , gemcitabine , paclitaxel and irinotecan , with a mean combination index of 0.43-0.78 ( <1.0 indicates synergism ) in the A549 NSCLC cell line . In conclusion , our results showed that Sup ODNs have an anticancer effect and increase the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to conventional anticancer drugs by modifying Akt and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway . Thus , Sup ODNs may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients .
OBJECTIVE In addition to its effects on cholesterol levels , apoE3 has lipid-independent effects that contribute to cardiovascular protection ; one of these effects is the ability to inhibit cell cycling in VSMCs . The goal of this study was to identify and characterize cell cycle-regulatory mechanisms responsible for the anti-mitogenic effect of apoE . METHODS AND RESULTS Primary VSMCs were stimulated with serum in the absence or presence of apoE3. apoE3 upregulated expression of the cdk inhibitor , p27(kip1) , in primary VSMCs , and this effect required Cox2 and activation of PGI(2)-IP signaling . The microRNA family , miR221/222 has recently been identified as a post-translational regulator of p27 , and apoE3 inhibited miR221/222 expression in a Cox2- and PGI(2)/IP-dependent manner . Moreover , reconstituted miR222 expression was sufficient to override the effects of apoE on p27 expression and S phase entry . The ability to repress expression of miR221/222 is shared by apoE3-containing HDL but is absent from apoA-1 , LDL and apoE-depleted HDL . All three apoE isoforms regulate miR221/222 , and the effect is independent of the C-terminal lipid-binding domain. miR221/222 levels are increased in the aortae of apoE3-null mice and reduced when apoE3 expression is reconstituted by adeno-associated virus infection . Thus , regulation of miR221/222 by apoE3 occurs invivo as well as invitro . CONCLUSIONS ApoE inhibits VSMC proliferation by regulating p27 through miR221/222 . Control of cell cycle-regulatory microRNAs adds a new dimension to the spectrum of cardiovascular protective effects afforded by apoE and apoE-HDL .
Protein kinase B ( AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the tumorigenesis and progression of multiple tumors , and has been shown to be important therapeutic targets for cancer . The present study aimed to explore the role and molecular mechanisms of AKT/mTOR pathway in human hemangioma ( HA ) . Twenty-five cases of human HA tissues were collected . The expression of AKT , mTOR and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) proteins was evaluated using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry in biopsy samples in different phases of HA . AKT/mTOR pathway was blocked by recombinant small hairpin RNA adenovirus vector rAd5-AKT+mTOR ( rAd5-Am ) , used for infecting proliferating phase HA-derived endothelial cells ( HDEC ) . The expression of AKT , mTOR and PCNA was detected by Real-time PCR and Western blot assays . Cell proliferative activities were determined by MTT assay , and cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry . As a consequence , the expression of AKT , mTOR and PCNA was significantly increased in proliferative phase HA , while that was decreased in involutive phase . Combined blockade of AKT/mTOR pathway by rAd5-Am diminished cell proliferative activities , and induced cell apoptosis and cycle arrest with the decreased expression of AKT , mTOR and PCNA in proliferative phase HDEC . In conclusion , the activity of AKT/mTOR pathway was increased in proliferative phase HA , while it was decreased in involutive phase . Combined blockade of AKT/mTOR pathway might suppress cell proliferation via down-regulation of PCNA expression , and induce apoptosis and cycle arrest in proliferative phase HDEC , suggesting that AKT/mTOR pathway might represent the important therapeutic targets for human HA .
Activation of p53 effectively inhibits tumor angiogenesis that is necessary for tumor growth and metastasis . Reactivation of the p53 by small molecules has emerged as a promising new strategy for cancer therapy . Several classes of small-molecules that activate the p53 pathway have been discovered using various approaches . Here , we identified harmine ( beta-carboline alkaloid ) as a novel activator of p53 signaling involved in inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth . Harmine induced p53 phosphorylation and disrupted the p53-MDM2 interaction . Harmine also prevented p53 degradation in the presence of cycloheximide and activated nuclear accumulation of p53 followed by increasing its transcriptional activity in endothelial cells . Moreover , harmine not only induced endothelial cell cycle arrest and apoptosis , but also suppressed endothelial cell migration and tube formation as well as induction of neovascularity in a mouse corneal micropocket assay . Finally , harmine inhibited tumor growth by reducing tumor angiogenesis , as demonstrated by a xenograft tumor model . Our results suggested a novel mechanism and bioactivity of harmine , which inhibited tumor growth by activating the p53 signaling pathway and blocking angiogenesis in endothelial cells .
Background and Objective . The cell cycle is regulated by proteins at different checkpoints , and dysregulation of this cycle plays a role in carcinogenesis . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are enzymes that degrade collagen and promote tumour infiltration . The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of various cell cycle regulators and MMPs and to correlate such expression with progression and recurrence in patients with stage T1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder ( UCB ) . Patients and Methods . This population-based cohort study comprised 201 well-characterized patients with primary stage T1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder . Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed material to quantify expression of cell cycle regulators and two MMPs . Results . Normal expression of p53 and abnormal expression of MMP9 were associated with greater risk of tumour recurrence . Also , normal p16 expression was related to a lower risk of tumour progression . MMP2 , p21 , cyclin D1 , and pRb showed no significant results that could estimate progression or recurrence . Conclusions . Normal p16 expression is associated with a lower risk of tumour progression , but immunohistochemistry on cell cycle regulators and MMPs has little value in predicting the prognosis in stage T1 UCB .
Cellular redox changes have emerged as a pivotal and proximal event in cancer . PKI 166 is used to determine the effects of redox sensitive inhibition of EGFR , metastasis and apoptosis in epidermoid carcinoma . Cytotoxicity study of PKI 166 ( IC50 1.0 microM ) treated A431 cells were performed by MTT assay for 48 and 72 hrs . Morphological analysis of PKI 166 treated A431 cells for 48 hrs. revealed the cell shrinkage , loss of filopodia and lamellipodia by phase contrast and SEM images in dose dependent manner . It has cytotoxic effects through inhibiting cellular proliferation , leads to the induction of apoptosis , as increased fraction of sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle , chromatin condensation and DNA ladder . It inhibited cyclin-D1 and cyclin-E expression and induced p53 , p21 expression in dose dependent manner . Consequently , an imbalance of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio triggered caspase cascade and subsequent cleavage of PARP , thereby shifting the balance in favour of apoptosis . PKI 166 treatment actively stimulated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and mitochondrial membrane depolarization . It inhibited some metastatic properties of A431 cells supressing colony formation by soft agar assay and inhibition of MMP 9 activity by gelatin zymography and western blot analysis . PKI 166 inhibited growth factor induced phosphorylation of EGFR , Akt , MAPK , JNK and colony formation in A431 cells . Thus the inhibition of proliferation was associated with redox regulation of the caspase cascade , EGFR , Akt/PI3K , MAPK/ ERK and JNK pathway . On the other hand , increased antioxidant activity leads to decreased ROS generation inhibit the anti-proliferative and apoptotic properties of PKI 166 in A431 cells . These observations indicated PKI 166 induced redox signalling dependent inhibition of cell proliferation , metastatic properties and induction of apoptotic potential in epidermoid carcinoma .
The Hippo signaling pathway inhibits cell growth and regulates organ size through a kinase cascade that leads to the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the growth-promoting transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein ( YAP)/Yorkie . It mediates contact inhibition of cell growth downstream of cadherin adhesion molecules and other cell surface proteins . Contact inhibition is often antagonized by mitogenic growth factor signaling . We report an important mechanism for this antagonism , inhibition of Hippo pathway signaling by mitogenic growth factors . EGF treatment of immortalized mammary cells triggers the rapid translocation of YAP into the nucleus along with YAP dephosphorylation , both of which depend on Lats , the terminal kinase in the Hippo pathway . A small-molecule inhibitor screen of downstream effector pathways shows that EGF receptor inhibits the Hippo pathway through activation of PI3-kinase ( PI3K ) and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase ( PDK1 ) , but independent of AKT activity . The PI3K-PDK1 pathway also mediates YAP nuclear translocation downstream of lysophosphatidic acid and serum as a result of constitutive oncogenic activation of PI3K . PDK1 associates with the core Hippo pathway-kinase complex through the scaffold protein Salvador . The entire Hippo core complex dissociates in response to EGF signaling in a PI3K-PDK1-dependent manner , leading to inactivation of Lats , dephosphorylation of YAP , and YAP nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activation of its target gene , CTGF . These findings show that an important activity of mitogenic signaling pathways is to inactivate the growth-inhibitory Hippo pathway and provide a mechanism for antagonism between contact inhibition and growth factor action .
UNLABELLED BACKGROUND Cell lines are very useful for clinical and basic research . Thus far , only 11 reports have documented the characteristics of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell lines in the literature . Due to the scarcity of information , the establishment of an ovarian malignant tumor cell line with distinctive characteristics is particularly important to study this disease . Thus , this study was undertaken to establish and characterize a new human endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell line of the ovary . METHODS The cell line NOMH-1 was established from an ovarian tumor of a 44-year-old woman . Features of the cell line studied included morphology , chromosome analysis , heterotransplantation , tumor markers , and chemosensitivity . RESULTS This cell line has been growing well for 232 months and subcultured more than 50 times . Monolayer cultured cells were polygonal in shape , showing a pavement-like arrangement and a tendency to stack without contact inhibition . They exhibited a human karyotype with a modal chromosomal number in the hypertriploid range . The cells could be transplanted into the subcutis of nude mice and produced tumors resembling the original tumor . NOMH-1 cells expressed both CEA and CA19-9 which were identified immunohistochemically in the original tumor and the heterotransplanted tumor . The cells were sensitive to paclitaxel , an agent commonly used in the treatment of gynecological cancers . CONCLUSIONS NOMH-1 is the first ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell line in which CEA and CA19-9 expression have been defined . This newly established cell line should be useful for investigating the characteristics of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma .
Disruption of contact inhibition and serum afflux that occur after a tissue injury activate cell cycle , which then stops when confluence is reached again . Although the events involved in cell cycle entry have been widely documented , those managing cell cycle exit have remained so far ill defined . We have identified that the final stage of wound closure is preceded in keratinocytes by a strong accumulation of miR-483-3p , which acts as a mandatory signal triggering cell cycle arrest when confluence is reached . Blocking miR-483-3p accumulation strongly delays cell cycle exit , maintains cells into a proliferative state and retards their differentiation program . Using two models of cell cycle synchronization ( i.e. mechanical injury and serum addition ) , we show that an ectopic upregulation of miR-483-3p blocks cell cycle progression in early G1 phase . This arrest results from a direct targeting of the CDC25A phosphatase by miR-483-3p , which can be impeded using an anti-miRNA against miR-483-3p or a protector that blocks the complex formation between miR-483-3p and the 3'-untranslated region ( UTR ) of CDC25A transcript . We show that the miRNA-induced silencing of CDC25A increases the tyrosine phosphorylation status of CDK4/6 cyclin-dependent kinases which , in turn , abolishes CDK4/6 capacity to associate with D-type cyclins . This prevents CDK4/6 kinases ' activation , impairs downstream events such as cyclin E stimulation and sequesters cells in early G1 . We propose this new regulatory process of cyclin-CDK association as a general mechanism coupling miRNA-mediated CDC25A invalidation to CDK post-transcriptional modifications and cell cycle control .
Within the family of protein kinase C ( PKC ) molecules , the novel isoform PRKCE ( PKCepsilon ) acts as a bona fide oncogene in in vitro and in vivo models of tumorigenesis . Previous studies have reported expression of PKCepsilon in breast , prostate and lung tumors above that of normal adjacent tissue . Data from the cancer genome atlas suggest increased copy number of PRKCE in triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . We find that overexpression of PKCepsilon in a non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line is sufficient to overcome contact inhibition and results in the formation of cellular foci . Correspondingly , inhibition of PKCepsilon in a TNBC cell model results in growth defects in two-dimensional ( 2D ) and three-dimensional ( 3D ) culture conditions and orthotopic xenografts . Using stable isotope labeling of amino acids in a cell culture phosphoproteomic approach , we find that CTNND1/p120ctn phosphorylation at serine 268 ( P-S268 ) occurs in a strictly PKCepsilon-dependent manner , and that loss of PKCepsilon signaling in TNBC cells leads to reversal of mesenchymal morphology and signaling . In a model of Ras activation , inhibition of PKCepsilon is sufficient to block mesenchymal cell morphology . Finally , treatment with a PKCepsilon ATP mimetic inhibitor , PF-5263555 , recapitulates genetic loss of function experiments impairing p120ctn phosphorylation as well as compromising TNBC cell growth in vitro and in vivo . We demonstrate PKCepsilon as a tractable therapeutic target for TNBC , where p120ctn phosphorylation may serve as a readout for monitoring patient response.Oncogene advance online publication , 1 April 2013 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.91 .
CONTEXT Papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) is the most frequent thyroid tumor and is responsible for the overall increase in thyroid cancer incidence . S100A11 ( calgizzarin ) , a member of the S100 Ca(2+)-binding protein family , is involved in several different biological processes . S100A11 has been found up-regulated in PTC , both at the mRNA and protein levels . OBJECTIVE Through a combination of expression analysis and functional in vitro and in vivo studies , we have attempted to gain insight into the relevance of S100A11 overexpression in PTC biology . DESIGN The expression of the S100A11 gene in PTC was investigated in several gene expression data sets . The effect of S100A11 silencing on the hallmarks of the malignant phenotype of several PTC-derived cell lines was investigated . In NIH3T3 cells , the cooperation of S100A11 with the different PTC-specific oncogenes was assessed . RESULTS We found that the S100A11 gene expression is frequently up-regulated in PTC , anaplastic thyroid carcinoma , but not in follicular thyroid carcinoma . S100A11 overexpression was also detected in PTC-derived cell lines , which were then used for functional studies . S100A11 silencing in PTC-derived cell lines did not affect cell proliferation , whereas it reduced the loss of contact inhibition , anchorage-independent growth , and resistance to anoikis . Cotransfection experiments in NIH3T3 cells showed that overexpression of the S100A11 gene was able to enhance the transforming capabilities of the different PTC-associated oncogenes by affecting the loss of contact inhibition , anchorage-independent growth , and in vivo tumor formation . CONCLUSION Our data indicate that S100A11 overexpression exerts a protumoral functional role in PTC pathogenesis .
Key cellular decisions , such as proliferation or growth arrest , typically occur at spatially defined locations within tissues . Loss of this spatial control is a hallmark of many diseases , including cancer . Yet , how these patterns are established is incompletely understood . Here , we report that physical and architectural features of a multicellular sheet inform cells about their proliferative capacity through mechanical regulation of YAP and TAZ , known mediators of Hippo signaling and organ growth . YAP/TAZ activity is confined to cells exposed to mechanical stresses , such as stretching , location at edges/curvatures contouring an epithelial sheet , or stiffness of the surrounding extracellular matrix . Weidentify the F-actin-capping/severing proteins Cofilin , CapZ , and Gelsolin as essential gatekeepers that limit YAP/TAZ activity in cells experiencing low mechanical stresses , including contact inhibition of proliferation . We propose that mechanical forces are overarching regulators of YAP/TAZ in multicellular contexts , setting responsiveness to Hippo , WNT , and GPCR signaling .
Although the immense efforts have been made for cancer prevention , early diagnosis , and treatment , cancer morbidity and mortality has not been decreased during last forty years . Especially , lung cancer is top-ranked in cancer-associated human death . Therefore , effective strategy is strongly required for the management of lung cancer . In the present study , we found that novel daphnane diterpenoids , yuanhualine ( YL ) , yuanhuahine ( YH ) and yuanhuagine ( YG ) isolated from the flower of Daphne genkwa ( Thymelaeaceae ) , exhibited potent anti-proliferative activities against human lung A549 cells with the IC50 values of 7.0 , 15.2 and 24.7 nM , respectively . Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the daphnane diterpenoids induced cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 as well as G2/M phase in A549 cells . The cell-cycle arrests were well correlated with the expression of checkpoint proteins including the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and p53 and down-regulation of cyclin A , cyclin B1 , cyclin E , cyclin dependent kinase 4 , cdc2 , phosphorylation of Rb and cMyc expression . In the analysis of signal transduction molecules , the daphnane diterpenoids suppressed the activation of Akt , STAT3 and Src in human lung cancer cells . The daphnane diterpenoids also exerted the potent anti-proliferative activity against anticancer-drug resistant cancer cells including gemcitabine-resistant A549 , gefitinib- , erlotinib-resistant H292 cells . Synergistic effects in the growth inhibition were also observed when yuanhualine was combined with gemcitabine , gefitinib or erlotinib in A549 cells . Taken together , these findings suggest that the novel daphnane diterpenoids might provide lead candidates for the development of therapeutic agents for human lung cancers .
Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene amplification and overexpression are commonly present in glioblastoma , and confer advantages of growth , invasiveness and radio/chemotherapy-resistance for tumour cells . Here , we assessed the role of EGFR activation for downstream mitogenic signalling in the commonly used glioblastoma cell line U251 . Despite the high expression level , activation of EGFR under standard culture conditions was low . Intact EGFR function was verified by the rapid phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream mitogen-activated protein(MAP) kinase ERK1/2 upon addition of exogenous EGF to serum-starved cells . By contrast , addition of fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) activated downstream ERK1/2 via the MAP kinase kinase without phosphorylating EGFR . A phosphoreceptor tyrosine kinase array showed FBS-induced activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R),and the IGF-1R inhibitor AG1024 inhibited FBS-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 , implying IGF-1R as the major driver of FBS-associated mitogenic signalling in the absence of exogenous EGF . These findings have important implications for in vitro drug testing in glioblastoma . Moreover , activation of ERK1/2 was also strongly influenced by growth state and cell density of U251 cultures . Re-seeding exponentially growing cultures at high cell density induced p27/CDKN1B expression and suppressed P-ERK1/2 indicating a certain regulation of proliferation by contact inhibition . Strikingly , highly activated ERK1/2 signalling and cell cycle progression occurred when cells were released from plateau phase regardless of high seeding density . This phenomenon might implicate a proliferation response in the early recurrence observed after clinical therapy in glioblastoma patients . However , whether it will recapitulate in vivo remains to be demonstrated .
Accumulating data suggest arsenic may be an endocrine disruptor and tentatively linked to breast cancer by some studies . Therefore , we tested the effects of chronic inorganic arsenic exposure on the normal estrogen receptor ( ER)-negative breast epithelial cell line , MCF-10A . Cells were chronically exposed to a low-level arsenite ( 500nM ) for up to 24weeks . Markers of cancer cell phenotype and the expression of critical genes relevant to breast cancer or stem cells ( SCs ) were examined . After 24weeks , chronic arsenic-exposed breast epithelial ( CABE ) cells showed increases in secreted MMP activity , colony formation , invasion , and proliferation rate , indicating an acquired cancer cell phenotype . These CABE cells presented with basal-like breast cancer characteristics , including ER-alpha , HER-2 , and progesterone receptor negativity , and overexpression of K5 and p63 . Putative CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) breast SCs were increased to 80% over control in CABE cells . CABE cells also formed multilayer cell mounds , indicative of loss of contact inhibition . These mounds showed high levels of K5 and p63 , indicating the potential presence of cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) . Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition occurred during arsenic exposure . Overexpression of aromatase , a key rate-limiting enzyme in estrogen synthesis , occurred with arsenic starting early on in exposure . Levels of 17beta-estradiol increased in CABE cells and their conditioned medium . The aromatase inhibitor letrozole abolished arsenic-induced increases in 17beta-estradiol production and reversed cancer cell phenotype . Thus , chronic arsenic exposure drives human breast epithelia into a cancer cell phenotype with an apparent overabundance of putative CSCs . Arsenic appears to transform breast epithelia through overexpression of aromatase , thereby activating oncogenic processes independent of ER .
ANXA2 , a member of the annexin family , is overexpressed and plays important roles in tumor development . However , the significance of ANXA2 expression in gastric carcinoma has not been clarified.To elucidate its roles in growth of gastric cancer , ANXA2 expression in SGC-7901 cells was inhibited with a designated siRNA , then cell proliferation , cell cycling , apoptosis and motility were determined by MTT assay , flow cytometry , Hoechst 33342 staining and wound healing assay , respectively . To further assess the behavior of ANXA2 deleted SGC- 7901 cells , changes of microstructures were observed under fluorescence microscopy , laser scanning confocal microscopy and electron microscopy . We found that inhibition of ANXA2 expression caused cell proliferation to decrease significantly with G1 arrest , motility to be reduced with changes in pseudopodia/filopodia structure and F-actin and beta-tubulin expression , and apoptosis to be enhanced albeit without significance . At the same time , ANXA2 deletion resulted in fewer pseudopodia/filopodia , non-stained areas were increased , contact inhibition among cells reappeared , and expression of F-actin and beta-tubulin was decreased , with induction of polymerized disassembled forms . Taken together , these data suggest that ANXA2 overexpression is important to maintain the malignancy of cancer cells , and this member of the annexin family has potential to be considered as a target for the gene therapy of gastric carcinoma .
Aims : RAS-induced tumorigenesis has been suggested to follow a three-stage model consisting of an initial RAS activation , senescence induction , and evasion of p53-dependent senescence checkpoints . While reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) act as second messengers in RAS-induced senescence , they are also involved in oncogenic transformation by inducing proliferation and promoting mutations . In the current work , we investigated the role of extracellular superoxide dismutase ( SOD3 ) in RAS-induced senescence and immortalization in vitro and in vivo . We used a mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) primary cell model together with immortalized and transformed human cell lines derived from papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer . Results : Based on our data , sod3 RNA interference in H-RasV12-transduced cells markedly inhibited cell growth , while sod3 over-expression in MEFs initially caused a proliferative burst followed by the activation of DNA damage checkpoints , induction of p53-p21 signal transduction , and senescence . Subsequently , sod3-transduced MEF cells developed co-operative p21-p16 down-regulation and acquired transformed cell characteristics such as increased telomerase activity , loss of contact inhibition , growth in low-nutrient conditions , and in vivo tumorigenesis . Interestingly , as reported previously with RAS , we showed a dose-dependent response to SOD3 in vitro and in vivo involving transcriptional and non-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms . Innovation : SOD3 may mediate H-RasV12-induced initiation of primary cell immortalization . Conclusions : Our results indicate that SOD3 influences growth signaling in primary and cancer cells downstream of the ras oncogene and could serve as a therapy target at an early tumorigenesis phase .
Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) is a high molecular weight protein serine/threonine kinase that plays a central role in the maintenance of genomic integrity by activating cell cycle checkpoints and promoting repair of DNA double-strand breaks . Little is known about the regulatory mechanisms for ATM expression itself . MicroRNAs are naturally existing regulators that modulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner . Here , we show that a human microRNA , miR-421 , suppresses ATM expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region ( 3'UTR ) of ATM transcripts . Ectopic expression of miR-421 resulted in S-phase cell cycle checkpoint changes and an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation , creating a cellular phenotype similar to that of cells derived from ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) patients . Blocking the interaction between miR-421 and ATM 3'UTR with an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide rescued the defective phenotype caused by miR-421 overexpression , indicating that ATM mediates the effect of miR-421 on cell cycle checkpoint and radiosensitivity . Overexpression of the N-Myc transcription factor , an oncogene frequently amplified in neuroblastoma , induced miR-421 expression , which , in turn , down-regulated ATM expression , establishing a linear signaling pathway that may contribute to N-Myc-induced tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma . Taken together , our findings implicate a previously undescribed regulatory mechanism for ATM expression and ATM-dependent DNA damage response and provide several potential targets for treating neuroblastoma and perhaps A-T .
The multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib induced a variable but significant decrease of viability in both p53(wild-type) ( EHEB , JVM-2 , JVM-3 ) and p53(mutated) ( MEC-1 , MEC-2 , BJAB ) prolymphocytic B leukemic cells , due to a combination of cell cycle block in G1 and apoptosis . Antibody phospho-kinase array analysis revealed that dasatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of various kinases , including ERK1/2 and p38/MAPK as well as of STAT3 transcription factors , in both p53(wild-type) and p53(mutated) cells . Therefore , dasatinib might offer a novel therapeutic strategy not only for p53(wild-type) , but also for p53(mutated) B malignancies that have the worst prognosis and urgently need innovative therapeutic approaches .
SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 ( SMYD3 ) is a histone methyltransferase that plays an important role in transcriptional regulation in human carcinogenesis . It can specifically methylate histone H3 at lysine 4 and activate the transcription of a set of downstream genes , including several oncogenes ( e.g. , N-myc , CrkL , Wnt10b , RIZ and hTERT ) and genes involved in the control of cell cycle ( e.g. , CyclinG1 and CDK2 ) and signal transduction ( e.g. , STAT1 , MAP3K11 and PIK3CB ) . To determine the effects of SMYD3 over-expression on cell proliferation , we transfected SMYD3 into MDA-MB-231 cells and found that these cells showed several transformed phenotypes as demonstrated by colony growth in soft agar . Besides , we show here that down-regulation of SMYD3 could induce G1-phase cell cycle arrest , indicating the potent induction of apoptosis by SMYD3 knockdown . These results suggest the regulatory mechanisms of SMYD3 on the acceleration of cell cycle and facilitate the development of strategies that may inhibit the progression of cell cycle in breast cancer cells .
Landmark studies of the status of DNA damage checkpoints and associated repair functions in preneoplastic and neoplastic cells has focused attention on importance of these pathways in cancer development , and inhibitors of repair pathways are in clinical trials for treatment of triple negative breast cancer . Cancer heterogeneity suggests that specific cancer subtypes will have distinct mechanisms of DNA damage survival , dependent on biological context . In this study , status of DNA damage response ( DDR)-associated proteins was examined in breast cancer subtypes in association with clinical features ; 479 breast cancers were examined for expression of DDR proteins gammaH2AX , BRCA1 , pChk2 , and p53 , DNA damage-sensitive tumor suppressors Fhit and Wwox , and Wwox-interacting proteins Ap2alpha , Ap2gamma , ErbB4 , and correlations among proteins , tumor subtypes , and clinical features were assessed . In a multivariable model , triple negative cancers showed significantly reduced Fhit and Wwox , increased p53 and Ap2gamma protein expression , and were significantly more likely than other subtype tumors to exhibit aberrant expression of two or more DDR-associated proteins . Disease-free survival was associated with subtype , Fhit and membrane ErbB4 expression level and aberrant expression of multiple DDR-associated proteins . These results suggest that definition of specific DNA repair and checkpoint defects in subgroups of triple negative cancer might identify new treatment targets . Expression of Wwox and its interactor , ErbB4 , was highly significantly reduced in metastatic tissues vs. matched primary tissues , suggesting that Wwox signal pathway loss contributes to lymph node metastasis , perhaps by allowing survival of tumor cells that have detached from basement membranes , as proposed for the role of Wwox in ovarian cancer spread .
BACKGROUND Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) has efficiently adapted to its host and establishes a persistent infection characterized by low levels of viral gene expression and slow proliferation of HTLV-I infected cells over decades . We have previously found that HTLV-I p30 is a negative regulator of virus expression . RESULTS In this study we show that p30 targets multiple cell cycle checkpoints resulting in a delayed entry into S phase . We found that p30 binds to cyclin E and CDK2 and prevents the formation of active cyclin E-CDK2 complexes . In turn , this decreases the phosphorylation levels of Rb and prevents the release of E2F and its transcriptional activation of genes required for G1/S transition . Our studies also show that HTLV-II p28 does not bind cyclin E and does not affect cell cycle progression . CONCLUSIONS In contrast to HTLV-I , the HTLV-II-related retrovirus is not oncogenic in humans . Here we report that the HTLV-I p30 delays cell cycle progression while its homologue , HTLV-II p28 , does not , providing evidence for important differences between these two related retrovirus proteins .
Maintenance of genomic integrity is essential for adult tissue homeostasis and defects in the DNA-damage response ( DDR ) machinery are linked to numerous pathologies including cancer . Here , we present evidence that the DDR exerts tumor suppressor activity in gliomas . We show that genes encoding components of the DDR pathway are frequently altered in human gliomas and that loss of elements of the ATM/Chk2/p53 cascade accelerates tumor formation in a glioma mouse model . We demonstrate that Chk2 is required for glioma response to ionizing radiation in vivo and is necessary for DNA-damage checkpoints in the neuronal stem cell compartment . Finally , we observed that the DDR is constitutively activated in a subset of human GBMs , and such activation correlates with regions of hypoxia .
DNA damage checkpoints in the cell cycle may be important barriers against cancer progression in human cells . Fanconi anemia ( FA ) is an inherited DNA instability disorder that is associated with bone marrow failure and a strong predisposition to cancer . Although FA cells experience constitutive chromosomal breaks , cell cycle arrest at the G2 DNA damage checkpoint , and an excess of cell death , some patients do become clinically stable , and the mechanisms underlying this , other than spontaneous reversion of the disease-causing mutation , are not well understood . Here we have defined a clonal phenotype , termed attenuation , in which FA patients acquire an abrogation of the G2 checkpoint arrest . Attenuated cells expressed lower levels of CHK1 ( also known as CHEK1 ) and p53 . The attenuation could be recapitulated by modulating the ATR/CHK1 pathway , and CHK1 inhibition protected FA cells from cell death . FA patients who expressed the attenuated phenotype had mild bone marrow deficiency and reached adulthood , but several of them eventually developed myelodysplasia or leukemia . Better understanding of attenuation might help predict a patient's clinical course and guide choice of treatment . Our results also highlight the importance of evaluating the cellular DNA damage checkpoint and repair pathways in cancer therapies in general .
Cyclin-dependent kinases are most extensively studied targets for cancer chemotherapy since the tumor cells exhibit false checkpoints and can proliferate even if the genome is compromised . Cyclin-dependent kinases ensure the tight regulation of the cell cycle execution by mediating phosphorylation of cellular proteins . Deregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity by cellular and external factors leads to many diseases like cancers . Different methods like radiolabeled , fluorescence and luminescence are available for screening of library of compounds against kinases . However , bioluminescent methods offer several advantages like low background and no effect of fluorescent compound interference . Present study is focused on development , optimization and validation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 assay which is suitable for identification potent and selective , ATP competitive and non-competitive inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 . The aim of present investigation was to optimize the assay for cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cylin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E with use of bioluminescence based biochemical reaction . Both cyclin-dependent kinase 2 which are cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E complexes , have different affinity for ATP . Therefore , both isoform analogs of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 were optimized separately . Optimum cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E concentration were found to be 250 ng/well and 200 ng/well , respectively . Optimum substrate ( histone H1 ) concentration was found to be 2.5 mg/ml for both cyclin-dependent kinase 2 analogs . Optimum reaction time was found to be 20 min for both cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin complexes .
Isolinderanolide B ( IOB ) , a butanolide extracted from the stems of Cinnamomum subavenium , was investigated for its antiproliferative activity in T24 human bladder cancer cells . To identity the anticancer mechanism of IOB , its effect on apoptosis , cell cycle distribution , and levels of p53 , p21 Waf1/Cip1 , Fas/APO-1 receptor , and Fas ligand was assayed . Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the G0/G1 phase arrest is because of increase in the expression of p21 Waf1/Cip1 . An enhancement in Fas/APO-1 and membrane-bound Fas ligand ( mFasL ) might be responsible for the apoptotic effect induced by IOB . This study reports the novel finding that the induction of p21 Waf1/Cip1 and activity of the Fas/mFas ligand apoptotic system may participate in the antiproliferative activity of IOB in T24 cells .
